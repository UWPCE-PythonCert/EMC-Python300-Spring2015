'''Anarchism''' is a [[political philosophy]] that advocates [[stateless society|stateless societies]] often defined as [[self-governance|self-governed]] voluntary institutions,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;ANARCHISM, a social philosophy that rejects authoritarian government and maintains that voluntary institutions are best suited to express man's natural social tendencies.&quot; George Woodcock. &quot;Anarchism&quot; at The Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In a society developed on these lines, the voluntary associations which already now begin to cover all the fields of human activity would take a still greater extension so as to substitute themselves for the state in all its functions.&quot; [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Petr_Kropotkin___Anarchism__from_the_Encyclopaedia_Britannica.html Peter Kropotkin. &quot;Anarchism&quot; from the Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Anarchism.&quot; The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy. 2005. p. 14 &quot;Anarchism is the view that a society without the state, or government, is both possible and desirable.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan, Sean. Anarchism, London: Reaktion Books Ltd., 2004. p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; but that several authors have defined as more specific institutions based on non-[[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free associations]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;as many anarchists have stressed, it is not government as such that they find objectionable, but the hierarchical forms of government associated with the nation state.&quot; Judith Suissa.

New York. 2006. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;iaf-ifa.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;That is why Anarchy, when it works to destroy authority in all its aspects, when it demands the abrogation of laws and the abolition of the mechanism that serves to impose them, when it refuses all hierarchical organisation and preaches free agreement — at the same time strives to maintain and enlarge the precious kernel of social customs without which no human or animal society can exist.&quot; [[Peter Kropotkin]].

Anarchism is distinguished, philosophically, by its scepticism towards such moral relations – by its questioning of the claims made for such normative power – and, practically, by its challenge to those &quot;authoritative&quot; powers which cannot justify their claims and which are therefore deemed illegitimate or without moral foundation.&quot;[http://books.google.com.ec/books?id=kkj5i3CeGbQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Anarchism and Authority: A Philosophical Introduction to Classical Anarchism'' by Paul McLaughlin.

Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social wealth; an order that will guarantee to every human being free access to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life, according to individual desires, tastes, and inclinations.&quot; [[Emma Goldman]]. &quot;What it Really Stands for Anarchy&quot; in ''[[Anarchism and Other Essays]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker defined anarchism as opposition to authority as follows &quot;They found that they must turn either to the right or to the left, – follow either the path of Authority or the path of Liberty. Marx went one way; Warren and Proudhon the other. Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism&amp;nbsp;... Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx.&quot; [[Benjamin Tucker]].

As a subtle and anti-dogmatic philosophy, anarchism draws on many currents of thought and strategy.

The term ''[[wikt:anarchism|anarchism]]'' is a compound word composed from the word ''[[anarchy]]'' and the suffix ''[[-ism]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=anarchism&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 Anarchism], [[Online etymology dictionary]].&lt;/ref&gt; themselves derived respectively from the Greek {{lang|grc|ἀναρχία}}, i.e. ''anarchy''&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)narxi/a|ἀναρχία|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anarchy Anarchy], [[Merriam-Webster]] online.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=anarchy&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 Anarchy], [[Online etymology dictionary]].&lt;/ref&gt; (from {{lang|grc|ἄναρχος}}, ''anarchos'', meaning &quot;one without rulers&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)/narxos|ἄναρχος|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[privative]] prefix [[privative alpha|ἀν]]- (''an-'', i.e. &quot;without&quot;) + {{lang|grc|ἀρχός}}, ''archos'', i.e. &quot;leader&quot;, &quot;ruler&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)rxo/s|ἀρχός|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; (cf.

There would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, such as [[William Godwin]] and [[Wilhelm Weitling]], but they did not use the word ''anarchist'' or ''anarchism'' in describing themselves or their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Anarchists |last=Joll |first=James |year=1964 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-03642-5 |pages=27–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] was the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist, marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-nineteenth century.

&lt;!--Anarcho-communist Joseph Déjacque, the first person to use the term &quot;libertarian&quot; in a political sense and self-proclaimed advocate of libertarianism, needs to be added here.

They are the school of anarchistically inclined philosophers, that Graham identifies as a &quot;Primitivist&quot; and a school of &quot;Yangists,&quot; chapters 8 to 11, and 28 to 31. These thinkers appear to have been profoundly influenced by the Laozi, and also by the thought of the first and last of the Inner Chapters: &quot;Wandering Beyond,&quot; and &quot;Responding to Emperors and Kings.&quot; There are also possible signs of influence from Yang Zhu, whose concern was to protect and cultivate one's inner life-source. These chapters combine the anarchistic ideals of a simple life close to nature that can be found in the Laozi with the practices that lead to the cultivation and nurturing of life. &quot; [http://www.iep.utm.edu/zhuangzi/ &quot;Zhuangzi (Chuang-Tzu, 369–298 BCE)&quot; at the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zhuangzi]] wrote, &quot;A petty thief is put in jail.

But such interpretations reverberates subversive religious conceptions like the aforementioned seemingly anarchistic Taoist teachings and that of other anti-authoritarian religious traditions creating a complex relationship regarding the question as to whether or not [[Anarchism and religion|anarchism and religion are compatible]].

The French [[Renaissance humanism|renaissance]] political philosopher [[Étienne de La Boétie]] wrote in his most famous work the ''Discourse on Voluntary Servitude'' what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent.&lt;ref&gt;Several historians of anarchism have gone so far as to classify La Botie's treatise itself as anarchist, which is incorrect since La botie never extended his analysis from tyrannical government to government per se. But while La Botie cannot be considered an anarchist, his sweeping strictures on tyranny and the universality of his political philosophy lend themselves easily to such an expansion.[http://books.google.com.ec/books?id=6o-8P3iqf7IC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=anarchism+la+boetie&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=z79GU1rW1t&amp;sig=4ini7oZUie2U8-P0BpMLogXYWPs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eAOFUJCYJ4Le9AT_iYG4DA&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=anarchism%20la%20boetie&amp;f=false ''Introduction to The Politics of Obedience: The Discourse of Voluntary Servitude'' by Murray Rothbard. Ludwig Von Mises Institute. p. 18]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Quite rightly, La Boëtie recognizes the potential for domination in any democracy: the democratic leader, elected by the people, becomes intoxicated with his own power and teeters increasingly towards tyranny. Indeed, we can see modern democracy itself as an instance of voluntary servitude on a mass scale. It is not so much that we participate in an illusion whereby we are deceived by elites into thinking we have a genuine say in decision-making. It is rather that democracy itself has encouraged a mass contentment with powerlessness and a general love of submission.&quot;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/saul-newman-voluntary-servitude-reconsidered-radical-politics-and-the-problem-of-self-dominatio &quot;Voluntary Servitude Reconsidered: Radical Politics and the Problem of Self-Domination&quot;] [[Saul Newman]]&lt;/ref&gt;
The radical [[Protestant Christianity|Protestant Christian]] [[Gerrard Winstanley]] and his group the [[Diggers]] are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the 17th century in England.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Anarchists have regarded the secular revolt of the Diggers, or True Levellers, in seventeenth-century England led by Gerrard Winstanley as a source of pride. Winstanley, deeming that property is corrupting, opposed clericalism, political power and privilege. It is economic inequality, he believed, that produces crime and misery. He championed a primitive communalism based on the pure teachings of God as comprehended through reason.&quot; [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Kenneth_C._Wenzer__Godwin_s_Place_in_the_Anarchist_Tradition___a_Bicentennial_Tribute.html Kenneth C. Wenzer. &quot;Godwin's Place in the Anarchist Tradition — a Bicentennial Tribute&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;It was in these conditions of class struggle that, among a whole cluster of radical groups such as the Fifth Monarchy Men, the [[Levellers]] and the Ranters, there emerged perhaps the first real proto-anarchists, the Diggers, who like the classical 19th century anarchists identified political and economic power and who believed that a social, rather than political revolution was necessary for the establishment of justice. Gerrard Winstanley, the Diggers' leader, made an identification with the word of God and the principle of reason, an equivalent philosophy to that found in [[Tolstoy]]'s ''[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]''.&quot; Marlow. &quot;Anarchism and Christianity&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Although Proudhon was the first writer to call himself an anarchist, at least two predecessors outlined systems that contain all the basic elements of anarchism. The first was Gerrard Winstanley (1609–c. 1660), a linen draper who led the small movement of the Diggers during the Commonwealth. Winstanley and his followers protested in the name of a radical Christianity against the economic distress that followed the Civil War and against the inequality that the grandees of the New Model Army seemed intent on preserving. In 1649–1650 the Diggers squatted on stretches of common land in southern England and attempted to set up communities based on work on the land and the sharing of goods.&quot; George Woodcock Anarchism The Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;anarchist&quot; first entered the English language in 1642, during the [[English Civil War]], as a [[Pejorative|term of abuse]], used by [[Cavalier|Royalists]] against their [[Roundhead]] opponents.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime_20061207.shtml &quot;Anarchism&quot;], [[BBC Radio 4]] program, [[In Our Time (BBC Radio 4)|In Our Time]], Thursday 7 December 2006.

Modern anarchism sprang from the secular or religious thought of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], particularly [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.&lt;ref name=Encarta&gt;&quot;Anarchism&quot;, ''[[Encarta]] Online Encyclopedia'' 2006 (UK version).&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the political turmoil of the 1790s in the wake of the [[French Revolution]], [[William Godwin]] developed the first expression of [[anarchist schools of thought|modern anarchist thought]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Everhart, Robert B 1982. p. 115&quot;&gt;Everhart, Robert B. The Public School Monopoly: A Critical Analysis of Education and the State in American Society. Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research, 1982. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;godwinsep&quot; /&gt; Godwin was, according to [[Peter Kropotkin]], &quot;the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1910&quot; /&gt; while Godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early [[Edmund Burke]].&lt;ref&gt;Godwin himself attributed the first anarchist writing to [[Edmund Burke]]'s '' [[A Vindication of Natural Society]]''. &quot;Most of the above arguments may be found much more at large in Burke's ''Vindication of Natural Society''; a treatise in which the evils of the existing political institutions are displayed with incomparable force of reasoning and lustre of eloquence&amp;nbsp;...&quot; – footnote, Ch. 2 ''[[Political Justice]]'' by William Godwin.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WilliamGodwin.jpg|left|thumb|[[William Godwin]], &quot;the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1910&quot;&gt;Peter Kropotkin, [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/britanniaanarchy.html &quot;Anarchism&quot;], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' 1910.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as 'philosophical anarchism'. He argued in ''[[Political Justice]]'' (1793)&lt;ref name=&quot;godwinsep&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams, Ian 2001. p. 116&quot;&gt;Adams, Ian. Political Ideology Today. Manchester University Press, 2001. p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society, and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance. He thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force. Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy, he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power. Rather, he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;godwinsep&quot;&gt;{{sep entry|godwin|William Godwin|Mark Philip|2006-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Political Justice|Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Modern Morals and Manners]] |last=Godwin |first=William |authorlink=William Godwin |year=1796 |publisher=G.G. and J. Robinson |oclc=2340417 |origyear=1793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His aversion to the imposition of a rules-based society led him to denounce, as a manifestation of the people’s ‘mental enslavement’, the foundations of [[law]], [[property rights]] and even the institution of [[marriage]]. He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgment.
 
The French [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] is regarded as the first ''self-proclaimed'' anarchist, a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work ''[[What is Property?]]'', published in 1840. It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Guerin, ''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice'' (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt; He developed the theory of [[spontaneous order]] in society, where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests; his famous quote on the matter is, &quot;Liberty is the mother, not the daughter, of order.&quot; In ''What is Property?'' Proudhon answers with the famous accusation &quot;[[Property is theft]].&quot; In this work, he opposed the institution of decreed &quot;property&quot; (''propriété''), where owners have complete rights to &quot;use and abuse&quot; their property as they wish.&lt;ref name=&quot;proudhon-prop&quot;&gt;[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]], Pierre-Joseph. ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/proudhon/property/ch03.htm Chapter 3. Labour as the efficient cause of the domain of property]&quot;'' from ''&quot;[[What is Property?]]&quot;'', 1840&lt;/ref&gt; He contrasted this with what he called &quot;possession,&quot; or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use. Later, however, Proudhon added that &quot;Property is Liberty,&quot; and argued that it was a bulwark against state power.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Stewart. Introduction to ''Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon'', Anchor Books, Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc. 1969, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; His opposition to the state, organised religion, and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists, and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time.

===First International and the Paris Commune===

[[File:Bakunin.png|thumb|Collectivist anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] opposed the [[Marxist]] aim of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] in favour of universal rebellion, and allied himself with the federalists in the First International before his expulsion by the Marxists.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;]]

In Europe, harsh reaction followed the [[revolutions of 1848]], during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings. After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure, conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists, anarchists, liberals, and nationalists, to prevent further revolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Breunig |first=Charles |title=The Age of Revolution and Reaction, 1789–1850 |year=1977 |publisher=[[W.

Due to its links to active workers' movements, the International became a significant organisation. [[Karl Marx]] became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council. Proudhon's followers, the [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualists]], opposed Marx's [[state socialism]], advocating political [[abstentionism]] and small property holdings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dodson | first = Edward | title = The Discovery of First Principles: Volume 2 | publisher = Authorhouse | page=312 | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-595-24912-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Thomas | first = Paul | title = Karl Marx and the Anarchists | publisher = Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul |ref=harv | location = London | year = 1985 | isbn = 0-7102-0685-2 |page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1868, following their unsuccessful participation in the [[League of Peace and Freedom]] (LPF), Russian revolutionary [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his [[collectivist anarchism|collectivist anarchist]] associates joined the First International (which had decided not to get involved with the LPF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Thomas | first = Paul | title = Karl Marx and the Anarchists | publisher = Routledge and Kegan Paul | location = London | year = 1980 | isbn = 0-7102-0685-2 |page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; They allied themselves with the [[federalist]] socialist sections of the International,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bak | first = Jǹos | title = Liberty and Socialism | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers | location = Lanham | year = 1991 | isbn = 0-8476-7680-3 |page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property.

At first, the collectivists worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction. Subsequently, the International became polarised into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Engel | first = Barbara | title = Mothers and Daughters | publisher = Northwestern University Press | location = Evanston | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-8101-1740-1 |page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as [[centralism|centralist]] and predicted that, if a Marxist party came to power, its leaders would simply take the place of the [[ruling class]] they had fought against.&lt;ref name=&quot;bakuninmarx&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bakunin|first=Mikhail|authorlink=Mikhail Bakunin|origyear=1873|year=1991|title=Statism and Anarchy |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-36973-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarchist historian [[George Woodcock]] reports that &quot;The annual Congress of the International had not taken place in 1870 owing to the outbreak of the Paris Commune, and in 1871 the General Council called only a special conference in London. One delegate was able to attend from Spain and none from Italy, while a technical excuse – that they had split away from the Fédération Romande – was used to avoid inviting Bakunin's Swiss supporters. Thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present, and the General Council's resolutions passed almost unanimously. Most of them were clearly directed against Bakunin and his followers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Anarchism 1962&quot;/&gt; In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]], where Bakunin and [[James Guillaume]] were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York. In response, the federalist sections formed their own International at the [[Anarchist St. Imier International|St. Imier Congress]], adopting a revolutionary anarchist program.&lt;ref name=Graham-05&gt;Graham, Robert '[http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm ''Anarchism''] (Montreal: Black Rose Books 2005) ISBN 1-55164-251-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Paris Commune]] was a government that briefly ruled Paris from 18 March (more formally, from 28 March) to 28 May 1871. The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War. Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune. They included {{quote|[[Louise Michel]], the Reclus brothers, and [[Eugene Varlin]] (the latter murdered in the repression afterwards). As for the reforms initiated by the Commune, such as the re-opening of workplaces as co-operatives, anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised&amp;nbsp;... Moreover, the Commune's ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]] on French radical ideas. Indeed, the Commune's vision of a communal France based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes Bakunin's and Proudhon's ideas (Proudhon, like Bakunin, had argued in favour of the &quot;implementation of the binding mandate&quot; in 1848&amp;nbsp;... and for federation of communes). Thus both economically and politically the Paris Commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/anarchism/writers/anarcho/commune.html &quot;The Paris Commune&quot; by Anarcho]&lt;/ref&gt;}} George Woodcock states:
{{quote|a notable contribution to the activities of the Commune and particularly to the organisation of public services was made by members of various anarchist factions, including the mutualists Courbet, Longuet, and Vermorel, the [[Collectivist anarchism|libertarian collectivists]] Varlin, Malon, and Lefrangais, and the bakuninists Elie and [[Elisée Reclus]] and Louise Michel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anarchism 1962&quot;/&gt;}}

The anti-authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists, seeking to &quot;replace the privilege and authority of the State&quot; with the &quot;free and spontaneous organisation of labour.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Resolutions from the St. Imier Congress, in ''Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas'', Vol. 1, p. 100 [http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, the [[Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions]] (FOTLU) of the United States and Canada unanimously set 1 May 1886, as the date by which the [[Eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]] would become standard.&lt;ref name=foner/&gt;

In response, unions across the United States prepared a [[general strike]] in support of the event.&lt;ref name=foner/&gt; On 3 May, in Chicago, a fight broke out when [[strikebreaker]]s attempted to cross the picket line, and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Avrich |first=Paul |title=The Haymarket Tragedy |year=1984 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |isbn=0-691-00600-8 |page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, 4 May, anarchists staged a rally at Chicago's Haymarket Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Avrich |title=The Haymarket Tragedy |page=193 |isbn=0-691-04711-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally, killing an officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.odmp.org/officer/3972-patrolman-mathias-j.-degan |title=Patrolman Mathias J.

The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement. Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution. The incident became known as the [[Haymarket affair]], and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight-hour day. In 1890 a second attempt, this time international in scope, to organise for the eight-hour day was made. The event also had the secondary purpose of memorializing workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Foner |title=May Day |page=42 |isbn=0-7178-0624-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it had initially been conceived as a once-off event, by the following year the celebration of [[International Workers' Day]] on May Day had become firmly established as an international worker's holiday.&lt;ref name=foner&gt;{{cite book | last = Foner | first = Philip Sheldon | title = May day: a short history of the international workers' holiday, 1886–1986 | publisher = International Publishers | location = New York | year = 1986 | isbn = 0-7178-0624-3 |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, the [[International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam]] gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which important figures of the anarchist movement, including [[Errico Malatesta]], [[Pierre Monatte]], [[Luigi Fabbri]], [[Benoît Broutchoux]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Rudolf Rocker]], and [[Christiaan Cornelissen]]. Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, [[popular education]] issues, the [[general strike]] or [[antimilitarism]]. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and [[syndicalism]] (or [[trade union]]ism). Malatesta and Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue, as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a [[social revolution]], while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondation-besnard.org/article.php3?id_article=225 Extract of Malatesta's declaration] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that the trade-union movement was [[reformism|reformist]] and even [[Conservatism|conservative]], citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials. Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself, whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Skirda | first = Alexandre | title = [[Facing the Enemy|Facing the enemy: a history of anarchist organization from Proudhon to May 1968]] | publisher = [[A.

The [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|Spanish Workers Federation]] in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics, attracting 1.58 million members at one point and playing a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CNT was affiliated with the [[International Workers Association]], a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America. In Latin America in particular &quot;The anarchists quickly became active in organizing craft and industrial workers throughout South and Central America, and until the early 1920s most of the trade unions in [[Anarchism in Mexico|Mexico]], [[Anarchism in Brazil|Brazil]], Peru, Chile, and Argentina were anarcho-syndicalist in general outlook; the prestige of the Spanish C.N.T. as a revolutionary organization was
undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation. The largest and most militant of these organizations was the [[Federación Obrera Regional Argentina]]&amp;nbsp;... it grew quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million, which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Anarchism 1962&quot;/&gt;

===Propaganda of the deed and illegalism===
{{Main|Propaganda of the deed|Illegalism|Expropriative anarchism}}
[[File:Lugi Gallean2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Italian-American]] anarchist [[Luigi Galleani]]. His followers, known as Galleanists, carried out a series of bombings and assassination attempts from 1914 to 1932 in what they saw as attacks on 'tyrants' and 'enemies of the people']]
Some anarchists, such as [[Johann Most]], advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because &quot;we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bright/most/actionprop.html |title=&quot;Action as Propaganda&quot; by Johann Most, 25 July 1885 |publisher=Dwardmac.pitzer.edu |date=21 April 2003 |accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1880s, people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan, &quot;propaganda of the deed&quot; to refer to individual bombings, [[regicide]]s, and [[tyrannicide]]s. From 1905 onwards, the Russian counterparts of these anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal '[[Confiscation|expropriations]]'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Wayback |date=20090312022528 |url=http://www.zabalaza.net/theory/txt_anok_comm_ap.htm |title=&quot;Anarchist-Communism&quot; by Alain Pengam }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Illegalism]] as a practice emerged and within it &quot;The acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins (&quot;[[propaganda by the deed]]&quot;) and the anarchist burglars (&quot;[[individual reappropriation]]&quot;) expressed their desperation and their personal, violent rejection of an intolerable society. Moreover, they were clearly meant to be ''exemplary'' invitations to revolt.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;illegalism&quot;&gt;[http://recollectionbooks.com/siml/library/illegalistsDougImrie.htm The &quot;illegalists&quot; by Doug Imrie. From &quot;Anarchy: a Journal Of Desire Armed&quot;, Fall–Winter, 1994–95]&lt;/ref&gt; France's [[Bonnot Gang]] was the most famous group to embrace illegalism.

However, as soon as 1887, important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts. [[Peter Kropotkin]] thus wrote that year in ''Le Révolté'' that &quot;a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Billington, James H. 1998. ''Fire in the minds of men: origins of the revolutionary faith'' New Jersey: Transaction Books, p 417.&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action, for example through the [[trade union]] movement. The [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]], [[Fernand Pelloutier]], argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without &quot;the individual dynamiter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm |title=Table Of Contents |publisher=Blackrosebooks.net |date= |accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Political repression|State repression]] (including the infamous 1894 French ''[[lois scélérates]]'') of the anarchist and [[labour movement]]s following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, may have played a role in these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French [[socialist movement]], into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 [[Paris Commune]], the execution and exile of many ''[[communards]]'' to [[penal colonies]], favoured individualist political expression and acts.&lt;ref&gt;Historian [[Benedict Anderson]] thus writes: &lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;In March 1871 the Commune took power in the abandoned city and held it for two months. Then [[Adolphe Thiers|Versailles]] seized the moment to attack and, in one horrifying week, executed roughly 20,000 Communards or suspected sympathizers, a number higher than those killed in the recent war or during [[Robespierre]]'s '[[Reign of Terror|Terror]]' of 1793–1794. More than 7,500 were jailed or deported to places like New Caledonia. Thousands of others fled to Belgium, England, Italy, Spain and the United States. In 1872, stringent laws were passed that ruled out all possibilities of organising on the left. Not till 1880 was there a general amnesty for exiled and imprisoned Communards. Meanwhile, the Third Republic found itself strong enough to renew and reinforce [[Napoleon III of France|Louis Napoleon]]'s imperialist expansion – in Indochina, Africa, and Oceania. Many of France's leading intellectuals and artists had participated in the Commune ([[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] was its quasi-minister of culture, [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]] and [[Pissarro]] were active propagandists) or were sympathetic to it. The ferocious repression of 1871 and thereafter, was probably the key factor in alienating these milieux from the Third Republic and stirring their sympathy for its victims at home and abroad.&quot; (in {{cite news |author=Benedict Anderson |title=In the World-Shadow of Bismarck and Nobel |publisher=[[New Left Review]]|date=July–August 2004|url=http://newleftreview.org/?view=2519}}) &lt;/blockquote&gt; According to some analysts, in [[History of Germany since 1945|post-war Germany]], the prohibition of the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] (KDP) and thus of institutional far-left political organisation may also, in the same manner, have played a role in the creation of the [[Red Army Faction]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement. For example, U.S. [[William McKinley|President McKinley]]'s assassin [[Leon Czolgosz]] claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and [[feminist]] [[Emma Goldman]].  Bombings were associated in the media with anarchists because [[international terrorism]] arose during this time period with the widespread distribution of dynamite. This image remains to this day.

Propaganda of the deed was abandoned by the vast majority of the anarchist movement after World War I (1914–1918) and the [[1917 October Revolution]].

===Russian Revolution and other uprisings of the 1910s===
{{Main|Anarchism in Russia|Russian Revolution (1917)|Revolutions of 1917–23}}
[[File:Makhno group.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nestor Makhno]] with members of the anarchist [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]]]]
Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolshevik]]s in both [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution|October revolutions]], and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dirlik | first = Arif | title = Anarchism in the Chinese Revolution | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 1991 | isbn = 0-520-07297-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, following a political falling out with the Bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, the conflict culminated in the 1921 [[Kronstadt rebellion]], which the new government repressed. Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks; the anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to the [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Avrich | first = Paul | title = The Russian Anarchists | publisher = AK Press | location = Stirling | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-904859-48-8 |page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, in the [[Free Territory (Ukraine)|Free Territory]], they fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against the [[White movement|Whites]] (a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the October Revolution) and then the Bolsheviks as part of the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]] led by [[Nestor Makhno]], who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months.

Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the [[Kronstadt rebellion|Kronstadt uprising]], before they left Russia. Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia, criticising the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised. For them, [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]]'s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule that the rulers of the new &quot;socialist&quot; Marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true.&lt;ref name=&quot;bakuninmarx&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1872/karl-marx.htm On the International Workingmen's Association and Karl Marx]&quot; in ''Bakunin on Anarchy'', translated and edited by Sam Dolgoff, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Goldman | first = Emma | title = [[My Disillusionment in Russia]] |chapter=Preface |page=xx | publisher = Dover Publications | location = New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-486-43270-X |quote= My critic further charged me with believing that &quot;had the Russians made the Revolution à la Bakunin instead of à la Marx&quot; the result would have been different and more satisfactory. I plead guilty to the charge. In truth, I not only believe so; I am certain of it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; [[Communist party|Communist parties]] grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, for example, members of the major syndicalist movements of the [[Confédération générale du travail|CGT]] and [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW]] left the organisations and joined the [[Comintern|Communist International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last = Drachkovitch | editor1-first = Milorad M. |first=Max |last=Nomad |contribution=The Anarchist Tradition |title = Revolutionary Internationals 1864 1943 | publisher = Stanford University Press |page=88 | year = 1966 | isbn = 0-8047-0293-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Revolutions of 1917–23|revolutionary wave of 1917–23]] saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism. In the German uprising known as the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]] which established the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]] the anarchists [[Gustav Landauer]], [[Silvio Gesell]] and [[Erich Mühsam]] had important leadership positions within the revolutionary [[Council communism|councilist]] structures.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Munich Soviet (or &quot;Council Republic&quot;) of 1919 exhibited certain features of the TAZ, even though — like most revolutions — its stated goals were not exactly &quot;temporary.&quot; Gustav Landauer's participation as Minister of Culture along with Silvio Gesell as Minister of Economics and other anti-authoritarian and extreme libertarian socialists such as the poet/playwrights Erich Mühsam and Ernst Toller, and Ret Marut (the novelist B. Traven), gave the Soviet a distinct anarchist flavor.&quot; [[Hakim Bey]].

In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles, which included [[Nestor Makhno]], concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, called the ''[[Platformism|Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)]]'',&lt;ref name=Platformtext&gt;{{cite book |last=Dielo Trouda |authorlink=Dielo Truda |title=Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft) |origyear=1926 |url=http://www.anarkismo.net/newswire.php?story_id=1000 |accessdate=24 October 2006 |year=2006 |publisher=FdCA |location=Italy| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070311013533/http://www.anarkismo.net/newswire.php?story_id=1000| archivedate= 11 March 2007&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; was supported.

In the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of fascism in Europe transformed anarchism's conflict with the state. Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists. [[Anarchism in Italy|Italian anarchists]] played a key role in the [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] organisation ''[[Arditi del Popolo]]'', which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions, and achieved some success in their activism, such as repelling [[Blackshirts]] in the anarchist stronghold of [[Parma]] in August 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Holbrow, Marnie, [http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=8205 &quot;Daring but Divided&quot;] (''Socialist Review'' November 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; The veteran Italian anarchist, [[Luigi Fabbri]], was one of the first critical theorists of fascism, describing it as &quot;the preventive counter-revolution.&quot; &lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In France, where the [[far right leagues]] came close to insurrection in the [[6 February 1934 crisis|February 1934 riots]], anarchists divided over a [[united front]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, David. &quot;Fascism or Revolution.&quot; ''Le Libertaire''.

On 2 February 1934, Mühsam was transferred to the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] at [[Oranienburg concentration camp|Oranienburg]] when finally on the night of 9 July 1934, Mühsam was tortured and murdered by the guards, his battered corpse found hanging in a latrine the next morning.&lt;ref name=&quot; Shepherd&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Mühsam|first=Erich|editor=David A.

In Spain, the national anarcho-syndicalist trade union [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The events known as the Spanish Revolution was a workers' [[social revolution]] that began during the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of [[Anarchism in Spain|anarchist]] and more broadly [[libertarian socialist]] organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years, primarily [[Catalonia]], Aragon, [[Andalusia]], and parts of [[Levante, Spain|the Levante]].

[[File:Paul Goodman.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]], influential American anarchist author of ''[[Growing Up Absurd|Growing Up Absurd: Problems of Youth in the Organized Society]]'' among other works critical of contemporary societies.]] Anarchism sought to reorganise itself after the war and in this context the organisational debate between [[synthesis anarchism]] and [[platformism]] took importance once again especially in the [[Anarchism in Italy#Postwar years and today|anarchist movements of Italy]] and [[Anarchism in France#The Fourth Republic (1945–1958)|France]].

The guarantees of the 1940 Constitution permitted them to legally create an organization of this type, and it was thus that they agreed to dissolve the two principal Cuban anarchist organizations, the SIA and FGAC, and create a new, unified group, the Asociación Libertaria de Cuba (ALC), a sizable organization with a membership in the thousands.&quot;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Frank_Fernandez__Cuban_Anarchism__The_History_of_A_Movement.html#toc8 ''Cuban Anarchism: The History of A Movement'' by Frank Fernandez]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1944 to 1947, the Bulgarian Anarchist Communist Federation reemerged as part of a factory and workplace committee movement, but was repressed by the new Communist regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertgraham.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;[http://robertgraham.wordpress.com/anarchism-a-documentary-history-of-libertarian-ideas-volume-two-the-emergence-of-the-new-anarchism-1939-1977/ Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas, Volume Two: The Emergence of the New Anarchism (1939–1977) « Robert Graham's Anarchism Weblog&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945 in [[Anarchism in France|France]] the [[Fédération Anarchiste]] and the anarchosyndicalist trade union [[Confédération nationale du travail]] was established in the next year while the also [[Synthesist anarchism|synthesist]] [[Federazione Anarchica Italiana]] was founded in [[Anarchism in Italy|Italy]].

[[Anarcho-pacifism]] became influential in the [[Anti-nuclear movement]] and [[anti war movement]]s of the time&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In the forties and fifties, anarchism, in fact if not in name, began to reappear, often in alliance with pacifism, as the basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the Cold War.[http://robertgraham.wordpress.com/anarchism-a-documentary-history-of-libertarian-ideas-volume-two-the-emergence-of-the-new-anarchism-1939-1977/] The anarchist/pacifist wing of the peace movement was small in comparison with the wing of the movement that emphasized electoral work, but made an important contribution to the movement as a whole. Where the more conventional wing of the peace movement rejected militarism and war under all but the most dire circumstances, the anarchist/pacifist wing rejected these on principle.&quot;[http://www.monthlyreview.org/0901epstein.htm &quot;Anarchism and the Anti-Globalization Movement&quot; by Barbara Epstein]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In the 1950s and 1960s anarcho-pacifism began to gel, tough-minded anarchists adding to the mixture their critique of the state, and tender-minded pacifists their critique of violence.

By the late sixties, political protest was intertwined with cultural radicalism based on a critique of all authority and all hierarchies of power. Anarchism circulated within the movement along with other radical ideologies. The influence of anarchism was strongest among radical feminists, in the commune movement, and probably in the Weather Underground and elsewhere in the violent fringe of the anti-war movement.&quot; [http://www.monthlyreview.org/0901epstein.htm &quot;Anarchism and the Anti-Globalization Movement&quot; by Barbara Epstein]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 in [[Carrara]], Italy the [[International of Anarchist Federations]] was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in 1968 by the three existing European federations of France (the [[Fédération anarchiste|Fédération Anarchiste]]), the [[Federazione Anarchica Italiana]] of Italy and the [[Iberian Anarchist Federation]] as well as the [[Bulgaria]]n federation in French exile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iisg.nl/archives/en/files/l/10760196.php London Federation of Anarchists involvement in Carrara conference, 1968] International Institute of Social History.

&lt;/ref&gt; a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged. Although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of [[anarcha-feminism]], they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the 1960s. Anarchist anthropologist [[David Graeber]] and anarchist historian [[Andrej Grubacic]] have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism, with those &quot;who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits&quot; of the 19th century contrasted with the younger activists who are &quot;much more informed, among other elements, by [[Traditional knowledge|indigenous]], [[feminism|feminist]], ecological and [[counterculture|cultural-critical]] ideas&quot;, and who by the turn of the 21st century formed &quot;by far the majority&quot; of anarchists.&lt;ref name=&quot;graeber&quot;&gt;[[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej Grubacic]], &quot;[http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=41&amp;ItemID=4796 Anarchism, Or The Revolutionary Movement Of The Twenty-first Century]&quot;, [[ZNet]].

Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting, property destruction, and violent confrontations with police. These actions were precipitated by ad hoc, leaderless, anonymous cadres known as ''[[black bloc]]s''; other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include [[security culture]], [[affinity groups]] and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet.&lt;ref name=rupert/&gt; A significant event of this period was the confrontations at [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|WTO conference in Seattle in 1999]].&lt;ref name=rupert/&gt; According to anarchist scholar [[Simon Critchley]], &quot;contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo-libertarianism of contemporary [[neo-liberalism]]&amp;nbsp;... One might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility, whether sexual, ecological or socio-economic; it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the West ravages the rest; it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality, impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Critchley#Infinitely Demanding|Infinitely Demanding]]'' by [[Simon Critchley]].

International anarchist federations in existence include the [[International of Anarchist Federations]], the [[International Workers' Association]], and [[International Libertarian Solidarity]].
The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederación General del Trabajo]] (CGT) and the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]. CGT membership was estimated at around 100,000 for 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Carley, Mark &quot;Trade union membership 1993–2003&quot; (International:SPIRE Associates 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Other active syndicalist movements include in Sweden the [[Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden]] and the [[Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation]]; the CNT-AIT in France;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnt-ait-fr.org/CNT-AIT/ACCUEIL.html%20Website%20of%20the%20Confédération%20Nationale%20du%20Travail%20-%20Association%20Internationale%20des%20Travailleurs http://www.cnt-ait-fr.org/CNT-AIT/ACCUEIL.html Website of the Confédération Nationale du Travail – Association Internationale des Travailleurs]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Unione Sindacale Italiana|Union Sindicale Italiana]] in Italy; in the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]]  and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]] and [[Anarchist Federation (Britain and Ireland)|Anarchist Federation]].

{{Main|Anarchist schools of thought}}
[[File:Portrait of Pierre Joseph Proudhon 1865.jpg|thumb|Portrait of philosopher [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1865) by [[Gustave Courbet]]. Proudhon was the primary proponent of anarchist [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], and influenced many later [[individualist anarchist]] and social anarchist thinkers.]]
Anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions, [[individualist anarchism]] and [[social anarchism]], which have some different origins, values and evolution.&lt;ref name=slevin/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;black dict&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://libertarian-labyrinth.org/archive/Anarchism Anarchism], [http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1855069954 The New Encyclopedia of Social Reform] (1908).&lt;/ref&gt; The individualist wing of anarchism emphasises [[negative liberty]], i.e. opposition to state or [[social control]] over the individual, while those in the social wing emphasise [[positive liberty]] to achieve one's potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfill, &quot;recognizing equality of entitlement&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Kevin and Boyd, Tony. ''Understanding Political Ideas and Movements''. Manchester University Press 2003, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; In a chronological and theoretical sense, there are classical – those created throughout the 19th century – and post-classical anarchist schools – those created since the mid-20th century and after.

Beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is [[philosophical anarchism]], which embodies the theoretical stance that the [[state (polity)|state]] lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it. A component especially of individualist anarchism&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William &amp; Tourain, Alain (Eds.). (2003). Anarchism. The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought (2nd Edition, p. 12).

(Mar., 1986), pp. 300–02.&lt;/ref&gt; philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a [[minarchism|minimal state]] as unfortunate, and usually temporary, &quot;necessary evil&quot; but argue that citizens do not have a [[moral obligation]] to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Klosko, George. ''Political Obligations''. Oxford University Press 2005. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; One reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was &quot;[[anarchism without adjectives]]&quot;, a call for [[toleration]] first adopted by [[Fernando Tarrida del Mármol]] in 1889 in response to the &quot;bitter debates&quot; of anarchist theory at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul. ''[[Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America]]''. Princeton University Press, 1996, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms (i.e. collectivist-, communist-, mutualist– and individualist-anarchism), it sought to emphasise the [[anti-authoritarian]] beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought.&lt;ref&gt;Esenwein, George Richard &quot;Anarchist Ideology and the Working Class Movement in Spain, 1868–1898&quot; [p. 135].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical anarchist schools of thought===

====Mutualism====
{{Main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}
Mutualism began in 18th-century English and French labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] in France and others in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A member of a community,&quot; ''The Mutualist''; this 1826 series criticised [[Robert Owen]]'s proposals, and has been attributed to a dissident Owenite, possibly from the Friendly Association for Mutual Interests of Valley Forge; [[Shawn Wilburn|Wilbur, Shawn]], 2006, &quot;More from the 1826 &quot;Mutualist&quot;?&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Proudhon proposed [[spontaneous order]], whereby organisation emerges without central authority, a &quot;positive anarchy&quot; where order arises when everybody does &quot;what he wishes and only what he wishes&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Proudhon, ''Solution to the Social Problem'', ed. H. Cohen (New York: Vanguard Press, 1927), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; and where &quot;business transactions alone produce the social order.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Proudhon |first=Pierre-Joseph |authorlink=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon |title=The Principle of Federation |publisher=University of Toronto Press |location=Toronto |year=1979 |isbn=0-8020-5458-7 |quote=The notion of ''anarchy'' in politics is just as rational and positive as any other. It means that once industrial functions have taken over from political functions, then business transactions alone produce the social order.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to recognize that Proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance. For this reason, much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self-governance, Proudhon was heavily involved in French parliamentary politics and allied himself not with Anarchist but Socialist factions of workers movements and, in addition to advocating state-protected charters for worker-owned cooperatives, promoted certain nationalization schemes during his life of public service.

Mutualist anarchism is concerned with [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform. According to the American mutualist [[William Batchelder Greene]], each worker in the mutualist system would receive &quot;just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Communism versus Mutualism&quot;, ''Socialistic, Communistic, Mutualistic and Financial Fragments''. (Boston: Lee &amp; Shepard, 1875) [[William Batchelder Greene]]: &quot;Under the mutual system, each individual will receive the just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount; and so much as the individual laborer will then get over and above what he has earned will come to him as his share in the general prosperity of the community of which he is an individual member.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul.

====Individualist anarchism====
{{Main|Individualist anarchism}}
{{Individualism sidebar}}
Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the [[individual]] and their [[will (philosophy)|will]] over any kinds of external determinants such as groups, society, traditions, and ideological systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;ryner&quot;&gt;&quot;What do I mean by individualism?
I mean by individualism the moral doctrine which, relying on no dogma, no tradition, no external determination, appeals only to the individual conscience.&quot;[http://www.marx.org/archive/ryner/1905/mini-manual.htm ''Mini-Manual of Individualism'' by Han Ryner]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tucker&quot;&gt;&quot;I do not admit anything except the existence of the individual, as a condition of his sovereignty. To say that the sovereignty of the individual is conditioned by Liberty is simply another way of saying that it is conditioned by itself.&quot;&quot;Anarchism and the State&quot; in ''Individual Liberty''&lt;/ref&gt; Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict.

In 1793, [[William Godwin]], who has often&lt;ref name=&quot;Everhart, Robert B 1982. p. 115&quot;/&gt; been cited as the first anarchist, wrote ''[[Political Justice]]'', which some consider the first expression of anarchism.&lt;ref name=&quot;godwinsep&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams, Ian 2001. p. 116&quot;/&gt; Godwin, a philosophical anarchist, from a [[rationalist]] and [[utilitarian]] basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a [[Limited government|minimal state]] as a present &quot;necessary evil&quot; that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge.&lt;ref name=&quot;godwinsep&quot;&gt;{{sep entry|godwin|William Godwin|Mark Philip|2006-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Political Justice|Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Modern Morals and Manners]] |last=Godwin |first=William |authorlink=William Godwin |year=1796 |publisher=G.G. and J.

[[William B.

Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, [[Development criticism|development critic]], surveyor, historian, philosopher, and leading [[transcendentalist]]. He is best known for his books ''[[Walden]]'', a reflection upon [[simple living]] in natural surroundings, and his essay, ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'', an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. Later [[Benjamin Tucker]] fused Stirner's egoism with the economics of Warren and Proudhon in his eclectic influential publication ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]''.

====Social anarchism====
{{Main|Social anarchism}}
{{Libertarian socialism}}
Social anarchism calls for a system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organisations, without any government authority or [[coercion]]. It is the largest school of thought in anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;This does not mean that the majority thread within the anarchist movement is uncritical of individualist anarchism. Far from it! Social anarchists have argued that this influence of non-anarchist ideas means that while its &quot;criticism of the State is very searching, and [its] defence of the rights of the individual very powerful,&quot; like Spencer it &quot;opens&amp;nbsp;... the way for reconstituting under the heading of 'defence' all the functions of the State.&quot; [http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/secGint.html Section G – Is individualist anarchism capitalistic?] ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Social anarchism rejects private property, seeing it as a source of social inequality (while retaining respect for [[personal property]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;theanarchistlibrary.org&quot;&gt;&quot;The revolution abolishes private ownership of the means of production and distribution, and with it goes capitalistic business. Personal possession remains only in the things you use. Thus, your watch is your own, but the watch factory belongs to the people.&quot;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Alexander_Berkman__What_Is_Communist_Anarchism_.html [[Alexander Berkman]]. &quot;[[Now and After|What Is Communist Anarchism?]]&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; and emphasises cooperation and [[mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Ostergaard|Ostergaard, Geoffrey]]. &quot;Anarchism&quot;.

[[AK Press]]. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivised. This was to be achieved through violent revolution, first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence, or ''[[propaganda by the deed]]'', which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production.&lt;ref name = &quot;Patsouras-p54&quot; /&gt;

However, collectivization was not to be extended to the distribution of income, as workers would be paid according to time worked, rather than receiving goods being distributed &quot;according to need&quot; as in anarcho-communism. This position was criticised by [[anarchist communists]] as effectively &quot;uphold[ing] the wages system&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kropotkin |first=Peter |title=The Conquest of Bread |publisher=AK Press |location=Edinburgh |year=2007 |chapter=13 |isbn=978-1-904859-10-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with [[Marxism]] but opposed the Marxist [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bakunin |first=Mikhail |title=Statism and Anarchy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1990 |isbn=0-521-36182-6 |quote=They [the Marxists] maintain that only a dictatorship&amp;nbsp;– their dictatorship, of course&amp;nbsp;– can create the will of the people, while our answer to this is: No dictatorship can have any other aim but that of self-perpetuation, and it can beget only slavery in the people tolerating it; freedom can be created only by freedom, that is, by a universal rebellion on the part of the people and free organization of the toiling masses from the bottom up.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchist, communist and collectivist ideas are not [[mutually exclusive]]; although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour, some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authorlink=James Guillaume|last=Guillaume |first=James |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/guillaume/works/ideas.htm |title=Ideas on Social Organization |year=1876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Anarcho-syndicalism=====
{{Main|Anarcho-syndicalism}}
[[File:Manifestación CNT Bilbao.jpg|thumb|left|May day demonstration of Spanish [[anarcho-syndicalist]] trade union [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] in [[Bilbao]], Basque Country in 2010]]Anarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the [[trade union|labour movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Sorel, Georges. 'Political Theorists in Context' Routledge (2004) p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-syndicalists view [[trade union|labour unions]] as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the [[State (polity)|state]] with a new society democratically self-managed by workers. The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are: Workers' [[wikt:Solidarity|solidarity]], [[Direct action]] and [[Workers' self-management]]
Anarcho-syndicalists believe that only [[direct action]] – that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal, as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position – will allow workers to liberate themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Rocker, Rudolf. 'Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice' AK Press (2004) p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organisations (the organisations that struggle against the wage system, which, in anarcho-syndicalist theory, will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or &quot;business agents&quot;; rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves. [[Rudolf Rocker]] was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought, and why it was important to the future of labour in his 1938 pamphlet ''Anarcho-Syndicalism''.The [[International Workers Association]] is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries. The Spanish [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] played and still plays a major role in the Spanish [[labour movement]]. It was also an important force in the [[Spanish Civil War]].

[[Anarcha-feminism]] (also called anarchist feminism and anarcho-feminism) combines anarchism with [[feminism]]. It generally views [[patriarchy]] as a manifestation of involuntary [[Coercion|coercive]] hierarchy that should be replaced by [[decentralised]] [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free association]]. Anarcha-feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of [[class struggle]], and the anarchist struggle against the [[State (polity)|state]]. In essence, the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice-versa. [[L. Susan Brown]] claims that &quot;as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power, it is inherently feminist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcha-feminism began with the late 19th century writings of early feminist anarchists such as [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]].

However Rothbard’s claim as an anarchist is quickly voided when it is shown that he only wants an end to the public state. In its place he allows countless private states, with each person supplying their own police force, army, and law, or else purchasing these services from capitalist venders...so what remains is shrill anti-statism conjoined to a vacuous freedom in hackneyed defense of capitalism.

Anarchism is a [[philosophy]] that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies and schools of thought; as such, disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common. The compatibility of [[anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]],&lt;ref name=oxcom&gt;&quot;Anarchism.&quot; ''[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2007, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; [[anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]], and [[anarchism and religion|religion]] with anarchism is widely disputed. Similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as [[Anarchism and Marxism|Marxism]], [[Issues in anarchism#Communism|communism]] and [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]]. Anarchists may be motivated by [[humanism]], [[Christian anarchism|divine authority]], [[enlightened self-interest]], [[veganarchism|veganism]] or any number of alternative ethical doctrines.

Phenomena such as [[civilization]], [[technology]] (e.g. within [[anarcho-primitivism]] and [[insurrectionary anarchism]]), and [[Issues in anarchism#Participation in statist democracy|the democratic process]] may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.

On a tactical level, while [[propaganda of the deed]] was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century (e.g. the [[Nihilist movement]]), some contemporary anarchists espouse alternative [[direct action]] methods such as [[nonviolence]], [[counter-economics]] and [[Crypto-anarchism|anti-state cryptography]] to bring about an anarchist society. About the scope of an anarchist society, some anarchists advocate a global one, while others do so by local ones.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Honderich, Carmen García Trevijano, [http://books.google.es/books?id=s9iwZGv44psC&amp;pg=PA402&amp;dq=Enciclopedia+teor%C3%ADa+pol%C3%ADtica&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#PPA57,M1 ''Oxford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy''].&lt;/ref&gt; The diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions, which has led to many [[definitional concerns in anarchist theory]].{{-}}

Intersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought, certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory.

Magnus Hirschfeld noted in 1923 that Goldman &quot;has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights, and especially for those deprived of their rights. Thus it came about that she was the first and only woman, indeed the first and only American, to take up the defense of homosexual love before the general public.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Jonathan Ned. ''Gay American History: Lesbians and Gay Men in the U.S.A.'' (New York: Thomas Y. Crowell, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, before Goldman, [[heterosexual]] anarchist Robert Reitzel (1849–1898) spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the 1890s in his Detroit-based German language journal ''Der arme Teufel''. In Argentina anarcha-feminist [[Virginia Bolten]] published the newspaper called ''{{lang|es|La Voz de la Mujer}}'' ({{lang-en|The Woman's Voice}}), which was published nine times in Rosario between 8 January 1896 and 1 January 1897, and was revived, briefly, in 1901.&lt;ref name=&quot;molyneux&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Molyneux|first=Maxine|title=Women's movements in international perspective: Latin America and beyond|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|year=2001|page=24|isbn=978-0-333-78677-2|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yg9HFrOG89kC&amp;pg=PA24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was [[Emile Armand]].&lt;ref name=&quot;armandfreelove&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iisg.nl/womhist/manfreuk.pdf |title=E. Armand and &quot;la camaraderie amoureuse&quot; – Revolutionary sexualism and the struggle against jealousy |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed the concept of ''la camaraderie amoureuse'' to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults. He was also a consistent proponent of [[polyamory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;armandfreelove&quot;/&gt; In Germany the [[stirner]]ists [[Adolf Brand]] and [[John Henry Mackay]] were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male [[bisexuality]] and [[homosexuality]]. [[Mujeres Libres]] was an anarchist women's organisation in Spain that aimed to empower working class women.  It was founded in 1936 by [[Lucía Sánchez Saornil]], Mercedes Comaposada and [[Amparo Poch y Gascón]] and had approximately 30,000 members. The organisation was based on the idea of a &quot;double struggle&quot; for [[Feminist movement|women's liberation]] and [[social revolution]] and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel. In order to gain mutual support, they created networks of women anarchists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/ws98/ws54_mujeres_libres.html Mujeres Libres – Women anarchists in the Spanish Revolution&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucía Sánchez Saornil]] was a main founder of the Spanish [[anarcha-feminist]] federation [[Mujeres Libres]] who was open about her [[lesbian]]ism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wzar.unizar.es/siem/articulos/Premios/MujeresLibres.pdf &quot;basta pensar en el lesbianismo de Lucía Sánchez Saornil&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; She was published in a variety of literary journals where working under a male pen name, she was able to explore [[lesbian]] themes&lt;ref&gt;&quot;R. Fue una época transgresora, emergió el feminismo y la libertad sexual estuvo en el candelero. Hay rastreos de muchas lesbianas escritoras: Carmen Conde[primera académica de número], Victorina Durán, Margarita Xirgu, Ana María Sagi, la periodista Irene Polo, Lucía Sánchez Saornil, fundadora de Mujeres Libres[sección feminista de CNT]... Incluso existía un círculo sáfico en Madrid como lugar de encuentro y tertulia.P. ¿Se declaraban lesbianas?R. Había quien no se escondía mucho, como Polo o Durán, pero lesbiana era un insulto, algo innombrable. Excepto los poemas homosexuales de Sánchez Saornil, sus textos no eran explícitos para poder publicarlos, así que hay que reinterpretarlos.&quot;[http://elpais.com/diario/2007/12/06/paisvasco/1196973608_850215.html &quot;Tener referentes serios de lesbianas elimina estereotipos&quot; by Juan Fernandez at ''El Pais'']&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when homosexuality was criminalized and subject to [[censorship]] and punishment.

More recently, the British [[anarcho-pacifist]] [[Alex Comfort]] gained notoriety during the [[sexual revolution]] for writing the bestseller sex manual ''[[The Joy of Sex]]''. The issue of [[free love]] has a dedicated treatment in the work of French anarcho-[[hedonist]] philosopher [[Michel Onfray]] in such works as ''Théorie du corps amoureux : pour une érotique solaire'' (2000) and ''L'invention du plaisir : fragments cyréaniques'' (2002).

His educational experiments, for example, possibly under the influence of the Swiss educational theorist [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] (via [[Robert Owen|Owen]]), emphasized – as we would expect – the nurturing of the independence and the conscience of individual children, not the inculcation of pre-conceived values.[http://www.crispinsartwell.com/warrenintrocurrent.htm &quot;Introduction of The Practical Anarchist: Writings of Josiah Warren&quot; by Crispin Sartwell]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Stirner]] wrote in 1842 a long essay on education called ''[[The False Principle of our Education]]''. In it Stirner names his educational principle &quot;personalist,&quot; explaining that self-understanding consists in hourly self-creation. Education for him is to create &quot;free men, sovereign characters,&quot; by which he means &quot;eternal characters&amp;nbsp;... who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/falseprinciple.html |title=The False Principle of our Education|author=Max Stirner |publisher=Tmh.floonet.net |date= |accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States &quot;freethought was a basically [[Anti-Christianity|anti-christian]], [[anti-clerical]] movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'' (anarchist publication) were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of ''Freethought'' and, for a time, ''The Truth Seeker''. E.C. Walker was co-editor of the excellent free-thought / free love journal ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mises.org&quot;/&gt; &quot;Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]'', ''Freethought'' and ''The Truth Seeker'' appeared in ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]''...&amp;nbsp;The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mises.org&quot;/&gt;

In 1901, Catalan anarchist and [[Freethought|free-thinker]] [[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]] established &quot;modern&quot; or [[Progressive education|progressive schools]] in [[Barcelona]] in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fidler&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Geoffrey C. Fidler |date=Spring–Summer 1985 |title=The Escuela Moderna Movement of Francisco Ferrer: &quot;Por la Verdad y la Justicia&quot; |journal=History of Education Quarterly |volume=25 |issue=1/2 |pages=103–132   |doi=10.2307/368893 |jstor=368893 |publisher=History of Education Society |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The schools' stated goal was to &quot;[[Popular education|educate the working class]] in a rational, secular and non-coercive setting&quot;. Fiercely anti-clerical, Ferrer believed in &quot;freedom in education&quot;, education free from the authority of church and state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/spain/ferrer.html |title=Francisco Ferrer's Modern School |publisher=Flag.blackened.net |date= |accessdate=20 September 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100807032003/http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/spain/ferrer.html| archivedate= 7 August 2010&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Murray Bookchin]] wrote: &quot;This period [1890s] was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where Anarchists exercised some degree of influence. Perhaps the best-known effort in this field was Francisco Ferrer's Modern School (Escuela Moderna), a project which exercised a considerable influence on Catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 7, ''[[anarcho-syndicalism|Anarchosyndicalism]], The New Ferment''. In Murray Bookchin, ''The Spanish anarchists: the heroic years, 1868–1936''. AK Press, 1998, p. 115. ISBN 1-873176-04-X&lt;/ref&gt; La Escuela Moderna, and Ferrer's ideas generally, formed the inspiration for a series of ''[[Modern School (United States)|Modern Schools]]'' in the United States,&lt;ref name=&quot;Fidler&quot;/&gt; [[Cuba]], South America and London. The first of these was started in New York City in 1911. It also inspired the Italian newspaper ''[[Università popolare (Italian newspaper)|Università popolare]]'', founded in 1901. Russian [[christian anarchist]] [[Leo Tolstoy]] established a school for peasant children on his estate.&lt;ref name=&quot;GroupedRef2&quot;&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Matt_Hern__The_Emergence_of_Compulsory_Schooling_and_Anarchist_Resistance.html &quot;The Emergence of Compulsory Schooling and Anarchist Resistance&quot; by Matt Hern]&lt;/ref&gt; Tolstoy's educational experiments were short-lived due to harassment by the Tsarist secret police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wilson | first = A.N. | title = Tolstoy | publisher = Norton, W. W. &amp; Company, Inc. | year = 2001 | page = xxi | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=imYmH8myBUsC&amp;pg=PR19 |  isbn = 0-393-32122-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolstoy established a conceptual difference between education and culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;GroupedRef2&quot; /&gt; He thought that &quot;Education is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself&amp;nbsp;... Education is culture under restraint, culture is free. [Education is] when the teaching is forced upon the pupil, and when then instruction is exclusive, that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GroupedRef2&quot; /&gt; For him &quot;without compulsion, education was transformed into culture&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GroupedRef2&quot; /&gt;

A more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of [[unschooling]] and the [[anarchist free school|free school]] in which child-led activity replaces pedagogic approaches. Experiments in Germany led to [[A. S. Neill]] founding what became [[Summerhill School]] in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Purkis | first = Jon | title = Changing Anarchism | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-7190-6694-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice.&lt;ref&gt;British anarchists [[Stuart Christie]] and [[Albert Meltzer]] manifested that &quot;A.S. Neill is the modern pioneer of libertarian education and of &quot;hearts not heads in the school&quot;. Though he has denied being an anarchist, it would be hard to know how else to describe his philosophy, though he is correct in recognising the difference between revolution in philosophy and pedagogy, and the revolutionary change of society. They are associated but not the same thing.&quot; [[Stuart Christie]] and [[Albert Meltzer]]. [http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/stuart-christie-albert-meltzer-the-floodgates-of-anarchy  ''The Floodgates of Anarchy'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Vincent (2010) ''Modern Political Ideologies'', 3rd edition, Oxford, Wiley-Blackwell p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; However, although Summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian, they differ in principle from those of Ferrer by not advocating an overtly political [[class struggle]]-approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Judith |last=Suissa |url=http://newhumanist.org.uk/1288/anarchy-in-the-classroom|title= Anarchy in the classroom |journal=[[The New Humanist]] |volume=120 |issue=5 |date=September–October 2005 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles, anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se. The term [[deschooling]] was popularised by [[Ivan Illich]], who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Illich| first=Ivan |title=Deschooling Society |place= New York|publisher= Harper and Row| year= 1971| isbn= 0-06-012139-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
{{Main|Criticisms of anarchism}}
Criticisms of anarchism include [[morality|moral]] criticisms and pragmatic criticisms. Anarchism is often evaluated as unfeasible or [[utopian]] by its critics. European history professor Carl Landauer, in his book ''European Socialism'' argued that social anarchism is unrealistic and that government is a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive force.&quot; He also argued that &quot;ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Landauer, Carl. ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Autism''' is a [[Neurodevelopmental disorder|disorder of neural development]] characterized by impaired [[Interpersonal relationship|social interaction]] and [[verbal communication|verbal]] and [[non-verbal communication]], and by restricted, repetitive or [[stereotypy|stereotyped]] behavior. The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent before a child is three years old.&lt;ref name=DSM-IV-TR-299.00&gt;{{vcite book |author=American Psychiatric Association |title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV |chapter=Diagnostic criteria for 299.00 Autistic Disorder |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |edition=4 |location=Washington, DC |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0-89042-025-4 |oclc=768475353 |url=http://cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Autism affects information processing in the [[Human brain|brain]] by altering how nerve cells and their [[synapse]]s connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood.&lt;ref name=Levy/&gt; It is one of three recognized disorders in the [[autism spectrum]] (ASDs), the other two being [[Asperger syndrome]], which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and [[PDD-NOS|pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified]] (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which is diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome are not met.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the [[Heritability of autism|genetics of autism]] are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare [[mutation]]s, or by rare combinations of common genetic variants.&lt;ref name=Abrahams/&gt; In rare cases, autism is strongly associated with [[Teratology|agents that cause birth defects]].&lt;ref name=Arndt/&gt; [[Controversies in autism|Controversies]] surround other proposed environmental [[Causes of autism|causes]], such as [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]], [[pesticide]]s or childhood [[vaccine]]s;&lt;ref name=Rutter/&gt; the vaccine hypotheses are biologically implausible and lack convincing scientific evidence.&lt;ref name=GerberOffit2009&gt;{{vcite journal |author= Gerber JS, Offit PA |title= Vaccines and autism: a tale of shifting hypotheses |journal= Clin Infect Dis |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=456–61 |year=2009 |pmid=19128068 |pmc= 2908388 |doi=10.1086/596476 |url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/48/4/456.full}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[prevalence]] of autism is about 1–2 per 1,000 people worldwide, and it occurs about four times more often in boys than girls.&lt;ref name=Newschaffer/&gt;  The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) report 20 per 1,000 children in the United States are diagnosed with ASD {{as of|2012|lc=y}}, up from 11 per 1,000 in 2008.&lt;ref name=MMWR2012&gt;{{vcite journal |title=Prevalence of autism spectrum disorders&amp;nbsp;— autism and developmental disabilities monitoring network, 14 sites, United States, 2008 |journal=MMWR Surveill Summ |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=1–19 |year=2012 |month=March |pmid=22456193|url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6103a1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='NHSR65'&gt;{{vcite journal|author=Stephen J.

Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life.&lt;ref name=CCD/&gt; The signs usually develop gradually, but some autistic children first develop more normally and then [[Regressive autism|regress]].&lt;ref name=Stefanatos/&gt; [[Early intensive behavior intervention|Early behavioral]], cognitive, or speech interventions can help autistic children gain self-care, social, and communication skills.&lt;ref name=CCD/&gt; Although there is no known cure,&lt;ref name=CCD/&gt; there have been reported cases of children who recovered.&lt;ref name=Helt/&gt; Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful.&lt;ref name=Howlin/&gt; An [[Sociological and cultural aspects of autism|autistic culture]] has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be [[Autism rights movement|accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder]].&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;

==Characteristics==
Autism is a highly variable [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]&lt;ref name=Geschwind/&gt; that first appears during infancy or childhood, and generally follows a steady course without [[Remission (medicine)|remission]].&lt;ref name=ICD-10-F84.0/&gt; Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months, become established by age two or three years,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Rogers SJ |title=What are infant siblings teaching us about autism in infancy? |title.= |journal=Autism Res |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=125–37 |year=2009 |pmid=19582867 |doi=10.1002/aur.81 |pmc=2791538 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and tend to continue through adulthood, although often in more muted form.&lt;ref name=Rapin/&gt; It is distinguished not by a single symptom, but by a characteristic triad of symptoms: impairments in social interaction; impairments in communication; and restricted interests and repetitive behavior. Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Filipek/&gt; Autism's individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits.&lt;ref name=London/&gt;

===Social development===
Social deficits distinguish autism and the related [[autism spectrum disorder]]s (ASD; see [[#Classification|Classification]]) from other developmental disorders.&lt;ref name=Rapin/&gt; People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. Noted autistic [[Temple Grandin]] described her inability to understand the [[social communication]] of [[neurotypical]]s, or people with normal [[neural development]], as leaving her feeling &quot;like an anthropologist on Mars&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |title=[[An Anthropologist on Mars]]: Seven Paradoxical Tales |author=[[Oliver Sacks|Sacks O]] |publisher=Knopf |year=1995 |isbn=0-679-43785-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood.&lt;!-- ref name=Volkmar/ --&gt; Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from [[social norms]]; for example, they have less [[eye contact]] and turn taking, and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as the deficiency to point at things.&lt;ref name=Volkmar/&gt; Three- to five-year-old autistic children are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form [[Attachment (psychology)|attachments]] to their primary caregivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev |year=2004 |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=221–33 |title=Early detection of core deficits in autism |author=Sigman M, Dijamco A, Gratier M, Rozga A |doi=10.1002/mrdd.20046 |pmid=15666338 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most autistic children display moderately less [[Attachment in children#Secure attachment|attachment security]] than non-autistic children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=J Child Psychol Psychiatry |year=2004 |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=1123–34 |title=Autism and attachment: a meta-analytic review |author=Rutgers AH, Bakermans-Kranenburg MJ, van IJzendoorn MH, van Berckelaer-Onnes IA |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.t01-1-00305.x |pmid=15257669 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Older children and adults with ASD [[Face perception#Face perception in individuals with autism|perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition]].&lt;ref name=Sigman&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Annu Rev Clin Psychol |year=2006 |volume=2 |pages=327–55 |title=Autism from developmental and neuropsychological perspectives |author=Sigman M, Spence SJ, Wang AT |doi=10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.2.022305.095210 |pmid=17716073 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children with high-functioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may affect the quality of life more deeply.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;

There are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD. The limited data suggest that, in children with intellectual disability, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and [[tantrum]]s. A 2007 study interviewed parents of 67 children with ASD and reported that about two-thirds of the children had periods of severe tantrums and about one-third had a history of aggression, with tantrums significantly more common than in non-autistic children with language impairments.&lt;ref name=Dominick/&gt; A 2008 Swedish study found that, of individuals aged 15 or older discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of ASD, those who committed violent crimes were significantly more likely to have other psychopathological conditions such as [[psychosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=J Interpers Violence |year=2008 |title=Risk factors for violent offending in autism spectrum disorder: a national study of hospitalized individuals |author=Långström N, Grann M, Ruchkin V, Sjöstedt G, Fazel S |volume=24 |issue=8 |pages=1358–70 |doi=10.1177/0886260508322195 |pmid=18701743 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication===
About a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=J Intellect Disabil Res |year=2006 |volume=50 |issue=9 |pages=621–32 |title=The ComFor: an instrument for the indication of augmentative communication in people with autism and intellectual disability |author=Noens I, van Berckelaer-Onnes I, Verpoorten R, van Duijn G |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2788.2006.00807.x |pmid=16901289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life, and may include delayed onset of [[babbling]], unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, autistic children have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Autistic children are less likely to make requests or share experiences, and are more likely to simply repeat others' words ([[echolalia]])&lt;ref name=Landa/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tager-Flusberg/&gt; or [[Pronoun reversal|reverse pronouns]].&lt;ref name=Kanner1943/&gt; [[Joint attention]] seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD:&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Pediatrics |year=2007 |volume=120 |issue=5 |pages=1183–215 |title=Identification and evaluation of children with autism spectrum disorders |author=Johnson CP, Myers SM, Council on Children with Disabilities |doi=10.1542/peds.2007-2361 |pmid=17967920 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/120/5/1183}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object,&lt;ref name=Volkmar/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tager-Flusberg/&gt; and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; Autistic children may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.&lt;ref name=Landa&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev |year=2007 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=16–25 |title=Early communication development and intervention for children with autism |author=Landa R |doi=10.1002/mrdd.20134 |pmid=17326115 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tager-Flusberg&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Pediatr Clin North Am |year=2007 |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=469–81 |title=Language disorders: autism and other pervasive developmental disorders |author=[[Helen Tager-Flusberg|Tager-Flusberg H]], Caronna E |doi=10.1016/j.pcl.2007.02.011 |pmid=17543905 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a pair of studies, high-functioning autistic children aged 8–15 performed equally well as, and adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;

===Repetitive behavior===
Autistic individuals display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R)&lt;ref name=Lam-Aman/&gt; categorizes as follows.

[[File:Autistic-sweetiepie-boy-with-ducksinarow.jpg|thumb|alt=Young boy asleep on a bed, facing the camera, with only the head visible and the body off-camera. On the bed behind the boy's head is a dozen or so toys carefully arranged in a line.|A young boy with autism who has arranged his toys in a row]]
* '''[[Stereotypy]]''' is repetitive movement, such as hand flapping, head rolling, or body rocking.
* '''[[Compulsive behavior]]''' is intended and appears to follow rules, such as arranging objects in stacks or lines.
* '''Sameness''' is resistance to change; for example, insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted.
* '''[[Ritual#Psychology|Ritualistic behavior]]''' involves an unvarying pattern of daily activities, such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual. This is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors.&lt;ref name=Lam-Aman&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=2007 |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=855–66 |title=The Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised: independent validation in individuals with autism spectrum disorders |author=Lam KSL, Aman MG |doi=10.1007/s10803-006-0213-z |pmid=17048092 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Restricted behavior''' is limited in focus, interest, or activity, such as preoccupation with a single television program, toy or game.
* '''[[Self-injury]]''' includes movements that injure or can injure the person, such as eye-poking, [[Dermatillomania|skin-picking]], hand-biting and head-banging.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; A 2007 study reported that self-injury at some point affected about 30% of children with ASD.&lt;ref name=Dominick/&gt;
No single repetitive or self-injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism, but only autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=2000 |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=237–43 |title=Varieties of repetitive behavior in autism: comparisons to mental retardation |author=Bodfish JW, Symons FJ, Parker DE, Lewis MH |doi=10.1023/A:1005596502855 |pmid=11055459 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other symptoms===
Autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis, but that can affect the individual or the family.&lt;ref name=Filipek&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Filipek PA, Accardo PJ, Baranek GT ''et al.'' |author.= |title=The screening and diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorders |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=1999 |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=439–84 |doi=10.1023/A:1021943802493 |pmid=10638459 }} This paper represents a consensus of representatives from nine professional and four parent organizations in the US.&lt;/ref&gt;
An estimated 0.5% to 10% of individuals with ASD show unusual abilities, ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious [[Savant syndrome|autistic savants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Treffert DA |title=The savant syndrome: an extraordinary condition.

[[Sensory system|Sensory]] abnormalities are found in over 90% of those with autism, and are considered core features by some,&lt;ref name=Geschwind-2009&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Geschwind DH |title=Advances in autism |journal=Annu Rev Med |volume=60 |pages=367–80 |year=2009 |pmid=19630577 |doi=10.1146/annurev.med.60.053107.121225 |pmc=3645857}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=J Child Psychol Psychiatry |year=2005 |volume=46 |issue=12 |pages=1255–68 |title=Annotation: what do we know about sensory dysfunction in autism?

An estimated 60%–80% of autistic people have motor signs that include [[poor muscle tone]], [[Apraxia|poor motor planning]], and [[toe walking]];&lt;ref name=Geschwind-2009/&gt; deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Fournier KA, Hass CJ, Naik SK, Lodha N, Cauraugh JH |title=Motor coordination in autism spectrum disorders: a synthesis and meta-analysis |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |volume= |issue= |pages= |year=2010 |pmid=20195737 |doi=10.1007/s10803-010-0981-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From studies based on [[event-related potential]]s, transient changes to the brain's electrical activity in response to stimuli, there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention, orientiation to auditory and visual stimuli, novelty detection, language and face processing, and information storage; several studies have found a preference for nonsocial stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Jeste SS, Nelson CA 3rd |title=Event related potentials in the understanding of autism spectrum disorders: an analytical review |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=495–510 |year=2009 |pmid=18850262 |doi=10.1007/s10803-008-0652-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[magnetoencephalography]] studies have found evidence in autistic children of delayed responses in the brain's processing of auditory signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Roberts TP, Schmidt GL, Egeth M ''et al.'' |author.= |title=Electrophysiological signatures: magnetoencephalographic studies of the neural correlates of language impairment in autism spectrum disorders |journal=Int J Psychophysiol |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=149–60 |year=2008 |pmid=18336941 |doi=10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2008.01.012 |pmc=2397446 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuropsychology===
Two major categories of [[cognitive]] theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior.

The first category focuses on deficits in [[social cognition]]. [[Simon Baron-Cohen]]'s [[empathizing–systemizing theory]] postulates that autistic individuals can systemize—that is, they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain—but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents. An extension, the extreme male brain theory, hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain, defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing.&lt;ref name=E-S-theory/&gt;  These theories are somewhat related to Baron-Cohen's earlier [[theory of mind]] approach, which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others. The theory of mind hypothesis is supported by autistic children's atypical responses to the [[Sally–Anne test]] for reasoning about others' motivations,&lt;ref name=E-S-theory&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Baron-Cohen S |title=Autism: the empathizing–systemizing (E-S) theory |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=1156 |pages=68–80 |year=2009 |pmid=19338503 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04467.x |url=http://docs.autismresearchcentre.com/papers/2009_BC_nyas.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in ''[[#Pathophysiology|Pathophysiology]]'' maps well to the hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Iacoboni/&gt; However, most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals' ability to understand other people's basic intentions or goals; instead, data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others' viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Hamilton AFdC |title=Goals, intentions and mental states: challenges for theories of autism |journal=J Child Psychol Psychiatry |volume=50 |issue=8 |pages=881–92 |year=2009 |pmid=19508497 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2009.02098.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing: the [[executive functions]] such as [[working memory]], planning, [[Inhibition Theory|inhibition]]. In his review, Kenworthy states that &quot;the claim of [[executive dysfunction]] as a causal factor in autism is controversial&quot;, however, &quot;it is clear that executive dysfunction plays a role in the social and cognitive deficits observed in individuals with autism&quot;.&lt;ref name=Kenworthy/&gt; Tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence, but performance never reaches typical adult levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=O'Hearn K, Asato M, Ordaz S, Luna B |title=Neurodevelopment and executive function in autism |journal=Dev Psychopathol |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=1103–32 |year=2008 |pmid=18838033 |doi=10.1017/S0954579408000527 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Hill EL |title=Executive dysfunction in autism |journal=Trends Cogn Sci |year=2004 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=26–32 |doi=10.1016/j.dr.2004.01.001 |pmid=14697400 }}&lt;/ref&gt; two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure&lt;ref name=Kenworthy&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Kenworthy L, Yerys BE, Anthony LG, Wallace GL |title=Understanding executive control in autism spectrum disorders in the lab and in the real world |journal=Neuropsychol Rev |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=320–38 |year=2008 |pmid=18956239 |doi=10.1007/s11065-008-9077-7 |pmc=2856078}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that executive function deficits have not been found in young autistic children.&lt;ref name=Sigman/&gt;

[[Weak central coherence theory]] hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism. One strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Happé F, Frith U |title=The weak coherence account: detail-focused cognitive style in autism spectrum disorders |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=2006 |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=5–25 |doi=10.1007/s10803-005-0039-0 |pmid=16450045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A related theory—enhanced perceptual functioning—focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and [[perceptual]] operations in autistic individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=2006 |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=27–43 |title=Enhanced perceptual functioning in autism: an update, and eight principles of autistic perception |author=Mottron L, [[Michelle Dawson|Dawson M]], Soulières I, Hubert B, Burack J |doi=10.1007/s10803-005-0040-7 |pmid=16453071 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism.

Neither category is satisfactory on its own; social cognition theories poorly address autism's rigid and repetitive behaviors, while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties.&lt;ref name=HappeTime&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Happé F, Ronald A, [[Robert Plomin|Plomin R]] |title=Time to give up on a single explanation for autism |journal=Nature Neuroscience |year=2006 |volume=9 |issue=10 |pages=1218–20 |doi=10.1038/nn1770 |pmid=17001340 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Dev Rev |year=2007 |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=224–60 |title=Cognitive theories of autism |author=Rajendran G, Mitchell P |doi=10.1016/j.dr.2007.02.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity, stereotyped and repetitive use of language or [[Idiosyncrasy#Psychiatry and psychology|idiosyncratic language]], and persistent preoccupation with parts of objects. Onset must be prior to age three years, with delays or abnormal functioning in either social interaction, language as used in social communication, or symbolic or imaginative play. The disturbance must not be better accounted for by [[Rett syndrome]] or [[childhood disintegrative disorder]].&lt;ref name=DSM-IV-TR-299.00/&gt; [[ICD-10]] uses essentially the same definition.&lt;ref name=ICD-10-F84.0&gt;{{vcite web|url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gf80.htm+f84 |year=2007 |accessdate=10 October 2009|work=ICD-10: International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems: Tenth Revision|publisher=World Health Organization |title=F84. Pervasive developmental disorders }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several diagnostic instruments are available. Two are commonly used in autism research: the [[Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised]] (ADI-R) is a semistructured parent interview, and the [[Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule]] (ADOS)&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Gotham K, Risi S, Dawson G, ''et al.'' |title=A replication of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) revised algorithms |journal=J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry |volume=47 |issue=6|pages=642–51 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18434924 |pmc=3057666 |doi=10.1097/CHI.0b013e31816bffb7 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses observation and interaction with the child. The [[Childhood Autism Rating Scale]] (CARS) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children.&lt;ref name=Volkmar/&gt;

A [[pediatrician]] commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child. If warranted, diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists, observing and assessing cognitive, communication, family, and other factors using standardized tools, and taking into account any associated [[medical conditions]].&lt;ref name=Dover/&gt; A pediatric [[neuropsychologist]] is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills, both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions.&lt;ref name=Kanne&gt;{{vcite journal|author=Kanne SM, Randolph JK, Farmer JE |title=Diagnostic and assessment findings: a bridge to academic planning for children with autism spectrum disorders |journal=Neuropsychol Rev |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=367–84 |year=2008|pmid=18855144 |doi=10.1007/s11065-008-9072-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[differential diagnosis]] for ASD at this stage might also consider [[intellectual disability]], [[hearing impairment]], and a [[specific language impairment]]&lt;ref name=Dover/&gt; such as [[Landau–Kleffner syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Dev Med Child Neurol |year=2000 |volume=42 |issue=5|pages=349–53 |title=Autistic regression and Landau–Kleffner syndrome: progress or confusion? |title.= |author=Mantovani JF |doi=10.1017/S0012162200210621 |pmid=10855658 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as [[Major depressive disorder|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Matson JL, Neal D|title=Cormorbidity: diagnosing comorbid psychiatric conditions |journal=Psychiatr Times |volume=26 |issue=4 |year=2009|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/1403043 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clinical genetics]] evaluations are often done once ASD is diagnosed, particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause.&lt;ref name=Caronna/&gt; Although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40% of cases to genetic causes,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Genet Med |year=2008 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=4–12 |title=Genetics evaluation for the etiologic diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders |author=Schaefer GB, Mendelsohn NJ|doi=10.1097/GIM.0b013e31815efdd7 |pmid=18197051 |laysummary=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/96448.php|laysource=Medical News Today |laydate=7 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; consensus guidelines in the US and UK are limited to high-resolution chromosome and [[fragile X]] testing.&lt;ref name=Caronna/&gt; A [[genotype]]-first model of diagnosis has been proposed, which would routinely assess the genome's copy number variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Ledbetter DH|title=Cytogenetic technology—genotype and phenotype |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=359 |issue=16 |pages=1728–30 |year=2008|pmid=18784093 |doi=10.1056/NEJMe0806570 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As new genetic tests are developed several ethical, legal, and social issues will emerge.

ASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months, although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life: for example, a one-year-old who meets diagnostic criteria for ASD is less likely than a three-year-old to continue to do so a few years later.&lt;ref name=Landa3&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Nat Clin Pract Neurol |year=2008 |volume=4|issue=3 |pages=138–47 |title=Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders in the first 3 years of life |author=Landa RJ|doi=10.1038/ncpneuro0731 |pmid=18253102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment, though few cases are handled that quickly in practice.&lt;ref name=Dover&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Arch Dis Child |year=2007 |volume=92 |issue=6 |pages=540–5 |title=How to diagnose autism |author=Dover CJ, Le Couteur A |doi=10.1136/adc.2005.086280 |pmid=17515625 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 US study found the average age of formal ASD diagnosis was 5.7 years, far above recommendations, and that 27% of children remained undiagnosed at age 8 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=[[Paul Shattuck|Shattuck PT]], Durkin M, Maenner M ''et al.'' |author.=|title=Timing of identification among children with an autism spectrum disorder: findings from a population-based surveillance study |journal=J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=474–83 |year=2009 |pmid=19318992|doi=10.1097/CHI.0b013e31819b3848 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood, they are sometimes missed; years later, adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves, to help their employers make adjustments, or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |publisher=National Autistic Society |title=Diagnosis: how can it benefit me as an adult?|title.= |year=2005|url=http://archive.is/1jEkC|accessdate=24 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases, and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices. The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD, resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms. Conversely, the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Shattuck PT, Grosse SD |title=Issues related to the diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders |journal=Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev |year=2007 |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=129–35|doi=10.1002/mrdd.20143 |pmid=17563895 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the [[visually impaired]], partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision, and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or [[blindism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |title=Visual impairment and autism: current questions and future research |author=Cass H |journal=Autism |year=1998 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=117–38|doi=10.1177/1362361398022002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification===
Autism is one of the five [[pervasive developmental disorder]]s (PDD), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior.&lt;ref name=ICD-10-F84.0/&gt; These symptoms do not imply sickness, fragility, or emotional disturbance.&lt;ref name=Rapin/&gt;

Of the five PDD forms, [[Asperger syndrome]] is closest to autism in signs and likely causes; [[Rett syndrome]] and [[childhood disintegrative disorder]] share several signs with autism, but may have unrelated causes; [[PDD not otherwise specified]] (PDD-NOS; also called ''atypical autism'') is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Volkmar FR, State M, Klin A |title=Autism and autism spectrum disorders: diagnostic issues for the coming decade |journal=J Child Psychol Psychiatry |volume=50 |issue=1–2 |pages=108–15 |year=2009|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2008.02010.x |pmid=19220594 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike with autism, people with Asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in [[language development]].&lt;ref name=DSM-IV-TR-299.00/&gt; The terminology of autism can be bewildering, with autism, Asperger syndrome and PDD-NOS often called the ''autism spectrum disorders'' (ASD)&lt;ref name=CCD/&gt; or sometimes the ''autistic disorders'',&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Freitag CM |title=The genetics of autistic disorders and its clinical relevance: a review of the literature |journal=Mol Psychiatry |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=2–22 |year=2007|doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4001896 |pmid=17033636 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas autism itself is often called ''autistic disorder'',''childhood autism'', or ''infantile autism''.

Delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long-term outcome&quot;.&lt;ref name=Filipek/&gt;
* No [[babbling]] by 12 months.
* No [[Gesture|gesturing]] (pointing, waving, etc.) by 12 months.
* No single words by 16 months.

* Any loss of any language or social skills, at any age.
US and Japanese practice is to [[Screening (medicine)|screen]] all children for ASD at 18 and 24 months, using autism-specific formal screening tests.

Several other conditions are common in children with autism.&lt;ref name=Levy/&gt; They include:

* '''Preempted diagnoses'''. Although the DSM-IV rules out concurrent diagnosis of many other conditions along with autism, the full criteria for [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)]], [[Tourette syndrome]], and other of these conditions are often present and these [[Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders|comorbid diagnoses]] are increasingly accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Eur J Pediatr |year=2008 |title=What's new in autism? |title.= |author=Steyaert JG, De La Marche W |doi=10.1007/s00431-008-0764-4 |pmid=18597114 |volume=167 |issue=10 |pages=1091–101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sleep problems''' affect about two-thirds of individuals with ASD at some point in childhood. These most commonly include symptoms of [[insomnia]] such as difficulty in falling asleep, frequent [[middle-of-the-night insomnia|nocturnal awakenings]], and early morning awakenings. Sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress, and are often a focus of clinical attention over and above the primary ASD diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Richdale AL, Schreck KA |title=Sleep problems in autism spectrum disorders: prevalence, nature, &amp; possible biopsychosocial aetiologies |journal=Sleep Med Rev |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=403–11 |year=2009 |pmid=19398354 |doi=10.1016/j.smrv.2009.02.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named. The ''[[Table Talk (Luther)|Table Talk]]'' of [[Martin Luther]], compiled by his notetaker, Mathesius, contains the story of a 12-year-old boy who may have been severely autistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Autism |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=13–23 |year=1997 |doi=10.1177/1362361397011004 |title=The history of ideas on autism: legends, myths and reality |author=[[Lorna Wing|Wing L]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil, and suggested that he be suffocated, although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |author=Miles M |year=2005 |title=Martin Luther and childhood disability in 16th century Germany: what did he write? what did he say? |title.= |publisher=Independent Living Institute |url=http://www.independentliving.org/docs7/miles2005b.html |accessdate=23 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest well-documented case of autism is that of Hugh Blair of Borgue, as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul Blair's marriage to gain Blair's inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Houston R, Frith U |title=Autism in History: The Case of Hugh Blair of Borgue |year=2000 |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=0-631-22089-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wild Boy of Aveyron]], a [[feral child]] caught in 1798, showed several signs of autism; the medical student [[Jean Marc Gaspard Itard|Jean Itard]] treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation.&lt;ref name=Wolff&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry |year=2004 |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=201–8 |title=The history of autism |author=Wolff S |doi=10.1007/s00787-004-0363-5 |pmid=15365889 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Latin]] word ''autismus'' (English translation ''autism'') was coined by the [[Swiss]] psychiatrist [[Eugen Bleuler]] in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of [[schizophrenia]]. He derived it from the Greek word ''autós'' (αὐτός, meaning ''self''), and used it to mean morbid self-admiration, referring to &quot;autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Kuhn R; tr.

The word ''autism'' first took its modern sense in 1938 when [[Hans Asperger]] of the [[Vienna General Hospital|Vienna University Hospital]] adopted Bleuler's terminology ''autistic psychopaths'' in a lecture in German about [[child psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Wien Klin Wochenschr |year=1938 |volume=51 |pages=1314–7 |trans_title=The psychically abnormal child |author=[[Hans Asperger|Asperger H]] |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as [[Asperger syndrome]], though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981.&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt; [[Leo Kanner]] of the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] first used ''autism'' in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label ''early infantile autism'' in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities.&lt;ref name=Kanner1943&gt;{{vcite journal |author=[[Leo Kanner|Kanner L]] |title=Autistic disturbances of affective contact |journal=Nerv Child |volume=2 |pages=217–50 |year=1943 }} Reprinted in {{vcite journal |year=1968 |journal=Acta Paedopsychiatr |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=100–36 |pmid=4880460 |author=&lt;!-- Pacify Citation bot. --&gt; |title=&lt;!-- Pacify Citation bot. --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner's first paper on the subject, notably &quot;autistic aloneness&quot; and &quot;insistence on sameness&quot;, are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.&lt;ref name=HappeTime/&gt; It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger.&lt;ref name=Lyons&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=2007 |volume=37 |issue=10 |pages=2022–3 |title=Asperger (1906–1980) and Kanner (1894–1981), the two pioneers of autism |author=Lyons V, Fitzgerald M |doi=10.1007/s10803-007-0383-3 |pmid=17922179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanner's reuse of ''autism'' led to decades of confused terminology like ''infantile schizophrenia'', and child psychiatry's focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant's response to &quot;[[refrigerator mother]]s&quot;. Starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome by demonstrating that it is lifelong, distinguishing it from intellectual disability and schizophrenia and from other developmental disorders, and demonstrating the benefits of involving parents in active programs of therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Can J Psychiatry |year=2003 |volume=48 |issue=8 |pages=503–5 |title=Modern views of autism |author=Fombonne E |pmid=14574825 |url=http://ww1.cpa-apc.org:8080/Publications/Archives/CJP/2003/september/guesteditorial.asp }}&lt;/ref&gt; As late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism; now it is thought to be one of the most heritable of all psychiatric conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |chapter=Genetic epidemiology of autism spectrum disorders |author=[[Peter Szatmari|Szatmari P]], Jones MB |pages=157–78 |title=Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorders |edition=2nd |editor=Volkmar FR |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |isbn=0-521-54957-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood ASD have deeply affected how we view ASD,&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt; parents continue to feel [[social stigma]] in situations where their autistic children's behaviors are perceived negatively by others,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=2008 |title=Adult attitudes toward behaviors of a six-year-old boy with autism |author=Chambres P, Auxiette C, Vansingle C, Gil S |doi=10.1007/s10803-007-0519-5 |pmid=18297387 |volume=38 |issue=7 |pages=1320–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and many [[primary care physician]]s and [[medical specialist]]s still express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=2005 |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=323–30 |title=A survey of autism knowledge in a health care setting |author=Heidgerken AD, Geffken G, Modi A, Frakey L |doi=10.1007/s10803-005-3298-x |pmid=16119473 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albedo-e hg.svg|thumb|Percentage of diffusely reflected sunlight in relation to various surface conditions]]

'''Albedo''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|l|ˈ|b|iː|d|oʊ}}), or ''reflection coefficient'', derived from [[Latin]] ''albedo'' &quot;whiteness&quot; (or reflected sunlight) in turn from ''albus'' &quot;white,&quot; is the [[diffuse reflection|diffuse reflectivity]] or reflecting power of a surface. It is the ratio of reflected radiation from the surface to incident radiation upon it. Its [[Dimensionless number|dimensionless]] nature lets it be expressed as a percentage and is measured on a scale from zero for no reflection of a perfectly black surface to 1 for perfect reflection of a white surface.

Albedo depends on the [[frequency]] of the radiation. When quoted unqualified, it usually refers to some appropriate average across the spectrum of [[visible light]]. In general, the albedo depends on the directional distribution of incident radiation, except for [[Lambertian reflectance|Lambertian surfaces]], which scatter radiation in all directions according to a cosine function and therefore have an albedo that is independent of the incident distribution. In practice, a [[bidirectional reflectance distribution function]] (BRDF) may be required to accurately characterize the scattering properties of a surface, but albedo is very useful as a first approximation.

The albedo is an important concept in [[climatology]], [[astronomy]], and calculating [[reflectivity]] of surfaces in [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] sustainable-rating systems for buildings. The average overall albedo of Earth, its ''planetary albedo'', is 30 to 35% because of cloud cover, but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Encyclopedia, 3rd ed., Thompson Gale, 2003, ISBN 0-7876-5486-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was introduced into optics by [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] in his 1760 work ''[[Photometria]]''.

Albedos of typical materials in visible light range from up to 0.9 for fresh snow to about 0.04 for charcoal, one of the darkest substances. Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a [[black body]]. When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms. Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4.&lt;ref name=&quot;PhysicsWorld&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Albedo.html |title=Albedo - from Eric Weisstein's World of Physics |publisher=Scienceworld.wolfram.com |accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average albedo of the [[Earth]] is about 0.3.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goode&quot;/&gt; This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds.

[[File:Ceres 2003 2004 clear sky total sky albedo.png|thumb|200px|left|2003–2004 mean annual clear-sky and total-sky albedo]]
Earth's surface albedo is regularly estimated via [[Earth observation]] satellite sensors such as [[NASA]]'s [[MODIS]] instruments on board the [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] and [[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]] satellites. As the total amount of reflected radiation cannot be directly measured by satellite, a [[mathematical model]] of the BRDF is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of [[directional-hemispherical reflectance]] and bi-hemispherical reflectance (e.g.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA&quot;/&gt;).

Earth's average surface temperature due to its albedo and the [[greenhouse effect]] is currently about 15&amp;nbsp;°C. If Earth were frozen entirely (and hence be more reflective) the average temperature of the planet would drop below −40&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;washington&quot; /&gt; If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers, the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;clim-past&quot;/&gt; In contrast, if the entire Earth is covered by water—a so-called aquaplanet—the average temperature on the planet would rise to just under 27&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith Robin&quot;/&gt;

===White-sky and black-sky albedo===
It has been shown that for many applications involving terrestrial albedo, the albedo at a particular [[solar zenith angle]] ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; can reasonably be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms: the directional-hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle, &lt;math&gt;{\bar \alpha(\theta_i)}&lt;/math&gt;, and the bi-hemispherical reflectance, &lt;math&gt;\bar{ \bar \alpha}&lt;/math&gt; the proportion concerned being defined as the proportion of diffuse illumination &lt;math&gt;{D}&lt;/math&gt;.

Albedo &lt;math&gt;{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; can then be given as:

:&lt;math&gt;{\alpha}= (1-D) \bar \alpha(\theta_i) + D \bar{ \bar \alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Directional-hemispherical reflectance]] is sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo and [[bi-hemispherical reflectance]] as white-sky albedo. These terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;BlueskyAlbedo&quot;/&gt;

==Astronomical albedo==
The albedos of [[planet]]s, [[Natural satellite|satellites]] and [[asteroid]]s can be used to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle (&quot;phase angle&quot;), and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer [[Solar System]] objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about [[regolith]] properties, whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in [[asteroid]]s.

[[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar System, with 99% of EM radiation reflected. Another notable high-albedo body is [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], with an albedo of 0.96.&lt;ref name=&quot;sicardy&quot;&gt;

The overall albedo of the [[Moon]] is around 0.12, but it is strongly directional and non-Lambertian, displaying also a strong [[opposition effect]].&lt;ref name=&quot;medkeff&quot; /&gt; Although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains, they are typical of the [[regolith]] surfaces of airless Solar System bodies.

Two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the (V-band) [[geometric albedo]] (measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer) and the [[Bond albedo]] (measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected). Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion.

In detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five [[Hapke parameters]] which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with [[phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]], including a characterization of the opposition effect of [[regolith]] surfaces.

The correlation between astronomical (geometric) albedo, [[Absolute magnitude#Absolute magnitude for planets (H)|absolute magnitude]] and diameter is:&lt;ref name=&quot;bruton&quot;&gt;{{cite web

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the astronomical albedo, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the diameter in kilometers, and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute magnitude.

==Examples of terrestrial albedo effects==

===Illumination===
Although the albedo–temperature effect is best known in colder, whiter regions on Earth, the maximum albedo is actually found in the tropics where year-round illumination is greater. The maximum is additionally in the northern hemisphere, varying between three and twelve degrees north.&lt;ref name=Winston&gt;{{cite journal| first=Jay |last=Winston |title=The Annual Course of Zonal Mean Albedo as Derived From ESSA 3 and 5 Digitized Picture Data |journal=Monthly Weather Review |volume=99 |pages=818–827| bibcode=1971MWRv...99..818W| year=1971| doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1971)099&lt;0818:TACOZM&gt;2.3.CO;2| issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minima are found in the subtropical regions of the northern and southern hemispheres, beyond which albedo increases without respect to illumination.&lt;ref name=Winston/&gt;

===Insolation effects ===
The intensity of albedo temperature effects depend on the amount of albedo and the level of local [[insolation]]; high albedo areas in the [[arctic]] and [[antarctic]] regions are cold due to low insolation, where areas such as the [[Sahara Desert]], which also have a relatively high albedo, will be hotter due to high insolation.  [[Tropical]] and [[sub-tropical]] [[rain forest]] areas have low albedo, and are much hotter than their [[temperate forest]] counterparts, which have lower insolation. Because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo, high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

===Climate and weather===
Albedo affects [[climate]] and drives [[weather]]. All weather is a result of the uneven heating of Earth caused by different areas of the planet having different albedos. Essentially, for the driving of weather, there are two types of albedo regions on Earth: Land and ocean. Land and ocean regions produce the four basic different types of [[air masses]], depending on latitude and therefore [[insolation]]: Warm and dry, which form over tropical and sub-tropical land masses; warm and wet, which form over tropical and sub-tropical oceans; cold and dry which form over temperate, polar and sub-polar land masses; and cold and wet, which form over temperate, polar and sub-polar oceans. Different temperatures between the air masses result in different air pressures, and the masses develop into [[pressure systems]]. High pressure systems flow toward lower pressure, driving weather from north to south in the northern hemisphere, and south to north in the lower; however due to the spinning of Earth, the [[Coriolis effect]] further complicates flow and creates several weather/climate bands and the [[jet stream]]s.

===Albedo–temperature feedback===
When an area's albedo changes due to snowfall, a snow–temperature [[feedback]] results. A layer of snowfall increases local albedo, reflecting away sunlight, leading to local cooling. In principle, if no outside temperature change affects this area (e.g. a warm [[air mass]]), the lowered albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall, deepening the snow–temperature feedback. However, because local [[weather]] is dynamic due to the change of [[seasons]], eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight (higher [[insolation]]) cause melting. When the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo, such as grass or soil, the effect is reversed: the darkening surface lowers albedo, increasing local temperatures, which induces more melting and thus increasing the albedo further, resulting in still more heating.

===Small-scale effects===
Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. In sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing.&lt;ref name=&quot;ranknfile-ue&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ranknfile-ue.org/h&amp;s0897.html |title=Health and Safety: Be Cool! (August 1997) |publisher=Ranknfile-ue.org |accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solar photovoltaic effects ===
Albedo can affect the [[electrical energy]] output of solar [[photovoltaic system|photovoltaic device]]s (PV). For example, the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar PV technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and crystalline silicon (c-Si)-based compared to traditional spectral-integrated albedo predictions. Research showed impacts of over 10%.&lt;ref&gt;Rob W. Andrews and Joshua M. Pearce, [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2013.01.030 The effect of spectral albedo on amorphous silicon and crystalline silicon solar photovoltaic device performance], ''Solar Energy'', '''91''',233–241 (2013). DOI:10.1016/j.solener.2013.01.030 [http://www.academia.edu/3081684/The_effect_of_spectral_albedo_on_amorphous_silicon_and_crystalline_silicon_solar_photovoltaic_device_performance open access]&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials (both human-made and natural) and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven PV materials covering three common PV system topologies: industrial (solar farms), commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched-roof applications.&lt;ref&gt;M.P. Brennan, A.L. Abramase, R.W. Andrews, [[J. M. Pearce]], [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solmat.2014.01.046 Effects of spectral albedo on solar photovoltaic devices], ''Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells'', 124, pp. 111-116,(2014). DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solmat.2014.01.046.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trees===
Because forests are generally attributed a low albedo, (as the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through [[photosynthesis]]), it has been erroneously assumed that removing forests would lead to cooling on the grounds of increased albedo. Through the [[evapotranspiration]] of water, trees discharge excess heat from the forest canopy. This water vapour rises resulting in [[cloud cover]] which also has a high albedo, thereby further increasing the net global cooling effect attributable to forests.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily. [[Deciduous trees]] have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 whereas [[coniferous trees]] have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15.&lt;ref name=&quot;mmutrees&quot; /&gt;

Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Betts&quot; /&gt;

===Snow===
Snow albedos can be as high as 0.9; this, however, is for the ideal example: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 0.8. If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo [[positive feedback]]). [[Cryoconite]], powdery windblown [[dust]] containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.&lt;ref name = &quot;Nat. Geo&quot;&gt;[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/06/melt-zone/jenkins-text/3 &quot;Changing Greenland - Melt Zone&quot;] page 3, of 4, article by Mark Jenkins in ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' June 2010, accessed 8 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water===
Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the [[Fresnel equations]] (see graph).
[[File:water reflectivity.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Reflectivity of smooth water at 20&amp;nbsp;°C (refractive index=1.333)]]
At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally [[specular reflection|specular manner]] (not [[Diffuse reflection|diffusely]]). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small [[angle of incidence|angles of incident]] light, [[waviness]] results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fresnel&quot; /&gt;

Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the [[terminator (solar)|terminator]] (early morning, late afternoon, and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.

Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. Fresh ‘black’ ice exhibits Fresnel reflection.

===Clouds===
[[Cloud albedo]] has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures. Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8. &quot;On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water. Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;livescience&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/environment/060124_earth_albedo.html |title=Baffled Scientists Say Less Sunlight Reaching Earth |publisher=LiveScience |date=24 January 2006 |accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic.&lt;ref name=&quot;uww&quot; /&gt; A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10&amp;nbsp;°C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies.&lt;ref name=&quot;harvard&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Kuwait oil fires as seen by Landsat |publisher=Adsabs.harvard.edu |date=30 May 1991|bibcode=1992JGR....9714565C |author1=Cahalan |first1=Robert F. |volume=97 |pages=14565 |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |doi=10.1029/92JD00799}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aerosol effects===
[[Aerosols]] (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) have both direct and indirect effects on Earth's radiative balance. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as [[cloud condensation nuclei]] and thereby change cloud properties) is less certain.&lt;ref name=&quot;girda&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm#671 |title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis |publisher=Grida.no |accessdate=19 August 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110629175429/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm| archivedate= 29 June 2011&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per &lt;ref name=&quot;DOMINICK&quot; /&gt; the effects are:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- Aerosol radiative forcing. --&gt;
* ''Aerosol direct effect.'' Aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation. The scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling, whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming.
* ''Aerosol indirect effect.'' Aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called [[cloud condensation nuclei]]. Increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations, which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo, increased light scattering and radiative cooling (''first indirect effect''), but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud (''second indirect effect'').
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Black carbon===
Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from [[black carbon]] particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;girda 1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm |title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis |publisher=Grida.no |accessdate=19 August 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110629180154/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm| archivedate= 29 June 2011&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the Arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo.&lt;ref&gt;James Hansen &amp; Larissa Nazarenko, ''Soot Climate Forcing Via Snow and Ice Albedos'', 101 Proc. of the Nat'l. Acad. of Sci. 423 (13 January 2004) (&quot;The efficacy of this forcing is »2 (i.e. for a given forcing it is twice as effective as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in altering global surface air temperature)&quot;); ''compare'' Zender Testimony, ''supra'' note 7, at 4 (figure 3); See J. Hansen &amp; L. Nazarenko, ''supra'' note 18, at 426. (&quot;The efficacy for changes of Arctic sea ice albedo is &gt;3. In additional runs not shown here, we found that the efficacy of albedo changes in Antarctica is also &gt;3.&quot;); ''See also'' Flanner, M.G., C.S. Zender, J.T. Randerson, and P.J. Rasch, ''Present-day climate forcing and response from black carbon in snow'', 112 J. GEOPHYS. RES. D11202 (2007) (&quot;The forcing is maximum coincidentally with snowmelt onset, triggering strong snow-albedo feedback in local springtime. Consequently, the &quot;efficacy&quot; of black carbon/snow forcing is more than three times greater than forcing by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human activities===
Human activities (e.g. deforestation, farming, and urbanization) change the albedo of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Other types of albedo==
[[Single-scattering albedo]] is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles. It depends on properties of the material ([[refractive index]]); the size of the particle or particles; and the wavelength of the incoming radiation.

'''A''' ([[English alphabet#Letter names|named]] ''a'' {{IPAc-en|'|eɪ}}, plural ''aes''&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;/&gt;) is the first [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] and [[vowel]] in the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]]. It is similar to the Ancient Greek letter [[alpha]], from which it derives.  The upper-case version consists of two more or less vertical lines, joined at the top, and crossed in their middle by a horizontal bar.

==History==
The earliest certain ancestor of &quot;A&quot; is [[aleph]] (also called 'aleph), the first letter of the [[Phoenician alphabet]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; (which, by consisting entirely of [[consonant]]s, is an [[abjad]] rather than a true [[alphabet]]). In turn, the origin of aleph may have been a [[pictogram]] of an ox head in [[proto-Sinaitic script]]&lt;ref name=Coll&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Hall-Quest|first=Olga Wilbourne|editor-first=Bernard|editor-last=Johnston|encyclopedia=Collier's Encyclopedia |title=A |edition=First |year=1997|publisher=P.F.

In 1600 B.C.E., the Phoenician alphabet's letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms. Its name must have corresponded closely to the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] or [[Arabic script|Arabic]] aleph.

When the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] adopted the alphabet, they had no use for the [[glottal stop]]—the first [[phoneme]] of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letter, and the sound that the letter denoted in [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] and other [[Semitic languages]]—so they used an adaptation of the sign to represent the vowel {{IPA|/a/}}, and gave it the similar name of [[alpha]]. In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the [[Greek Dark Ages]], dating to the 8th century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the [[Greek alphabet]] of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.

The [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the [[Italian Peninsula]] and left the letter unchanged. The Romans later adopted the [[Old Italic script|Etruscan alphabet]] to write the [[Latin|Latin language]], and the resulting letter was preserved in the [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] used to write many languages, including English.

===Typographic variants===
[[File:LowercaseA.svg|right|thumb|200|Typographic variants include a double-storey '''a''' and single-storey '''ɑ'''.]]
During Roman times, there were many variations on the letter &quot;A&quot;. First was the monumental or lapidary style, which was used when inscribing on stone or other &quot;permanent&quot; mediums. For perishable surfaces, what was used for everyday or utilitarian purposes, a [[cursive]] style was used. Due to the &quot;perishable&quot; nature of the surfaces, these examples are not as prevalent as the monumental. This perishable style was called cursive and numerous variations have survived, such as [[letter case|majuscule]] cursive, [[letter case|minuscule]] cursive, and semicursive minuscule. There were also variants that were intermediate between the monumental and the cursive. The known variants include the early [[Uncial script#Half-uncial|semi-uncial]], the uncial, and the later semi-uncial.&lt;ref name=Americana/&gt;

At the termination of the [[Roman Empire]] (5th century AD), several variants of the cursive minuscule appeared through Western Europe. Among these were the semicursive minuscule of [[Italy]], the [[Merovingian script]] in France, the [[Visigothic script]] in Spain, and the [[Insular script|Insular]] or Anglo-Irish semi-uncial or Anglo-Saxon majuscule, of Great Britain. By the 9th century, the [[Carolingian minuscule|Caroline script]], which was very similar to the present-day form, was the principal form used in book-making, before the advent of the printing press. This form was derived through a combining of prior forms.&lt;ref name=Americana/&gt;

15th-century Italy saw the formation of the two variants that are known today. These variants, the ''Italics'' and ''Roman'' forms, were derived from the Caroline Script version. The Italics form used in most current [[handwriting]] consists of a circle and vertical stroke ({{Unicode|&quot;ɑ&quot;}}), called [[Latin alpha]] or &quot;script a&quot;. This slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the Greek letter [[tau]] in the hands of dark-age Irish and English writers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; Most printed material uses the Roman form consisting of a small loop with an arc over it ({{Unicode|&quot;a&quot;}}).&lt;ref name=Americana/&gt; Both derive from the majuscule (capital) form. In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the uncial version shown. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical. In some of these, the [[serif]] that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form.

==Use in English==
In [[English orthography]], the letter A currently represents six different vowel sounds: A by itself frequently denotes the [[near-open front unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA|/æ/}}) as in ''pad''; the [[open back unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA|/ɑː/}}) as in ''father'', its original, Latin and Greek, sound;&lt;ref name=Coll/&gt; a closer, further fronted sound as in &quot;hare&quot;, which developed as the sound progressed from &quot;father&quot; to &quot;ace&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; in concert with a later orthographic vowel, the diphthong {{IPA|/eɪ/}} as in ''ace'' and ''major'', due to effects of the [[Great Vowel Shift]]; the more rounded form in &quot;water&quot; or its closely related cousin, found in &quot;was&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt;

The double &quot;a&quot; sequence is not a native English combination; however it occurs in some foreign words such as ''Aaron'' and ''aardvark''.&lt;ref name =AAE/&gt;

&quot;A&quot; is the third-most-commonly used letter in English (after &quot;E&quot; and &quot;T&quot;), and the second most common in Spanish and French. In one study, on average, about 3.68% of letters used in English tend to be 'a', while the number is 6.22% in Spanish and 3.95% in French.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trinity College&quot; /&gt;

==Use in other languages==
In most languages that use the Latin alphabet, A denotes an open unrounded vowel: {{IPA|/[[Open front unrounded vowel|a]]/}}, {{IPA|/[[Open central unrounded vowel|ä]]/}}, or {{IPA|/[[Open back unrounded vowel|ɑ]]/}}. An exception is [[Saanich dialect|Saanich]], in which A (and [[Á]]) stands for a [[close-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/e/}}.

==Use in mathematics, logic and science==
{{main|A (disambiguation)}}
In [[algebra]], the letter &quot;A&quot; along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities, whereas the letters at the end of the alphabet (x,y,z) are used to denote unknown quantities.

In [[geometry]], capital A, B, C etc. are used to denote [[Line segment|segment]]s, [[line (geometry)|line]]s, [[Line (geometry)#Ray|rays]], etc.&lt;ref name=Americana/&gt; Also, A is typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a [[triangle]].&lt;ref name=Coll/&gt;

In [[logic]], A is used to signify the [[Categorical proposition|universal affirmative]].

In phonetic and phonemic notation:
*in the [[help:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet]], {{IPA|[a]}} is used for the [[open front unrounded vowel]], {{IPA|[ä]}} is used for the [[open central unrounded vowel]] and {{IPA|[ɑ]}} is used for the [[open back unrounded vowel]].
*in [[X-SAMPA]], [a] is used for the [[open front unrounded vowel]] and [A] is used for the [[open back unrounded vowel]].

==Other uses==
{{main|A (disambiguation)}}
&quot;A&quot; is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status: A-, A or A+, the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students' schoolwork; &quot;A grade&quot; for clean restaurants; [[A-list]] celebrities, etc. Such associations can have a [[motivation|motivating]] effect, as exposure to the letter A has been found to improve performance, when compared with other letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.sciencealert.com.au/news/20100903-20689.html |title=Letters affect exam results |date=9 March 2010 |publisher=British Psychological Society |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A is a common symbol of school and basic phonetics in the US, along with [[B]] and [[C]].

Finally, the letter A is used to denote size, as in a narrow size shoe,&lt;ref name=Coll/&gt; or a small cup size in a [[brassiere]].

'''Alabama''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Alabama.ogg|ˌ|æ|l|ə|ˈ|b|æ|m|ə}}) is a state located in the [[Southern United States|southeastern region]] of the United States. It is bordered by [[Tennessee]] to the north, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to the east, Florida and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the south, and [[Mississippi]] to the west. Alabama is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|30th-most extensive]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|23rd-most populous]] of the [[List of U.S. states|50 United States]]. At {{convert|1300|mi|km}}, Alabama has one of the longest navigable inland waterways in the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;navwater&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commerce.alabama.gov/content/media/publications/Transportation/TransportationInAlabama.pdf |title=Transportation in Alabama |publisher=Alabama Development Office |accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[American Civil War]] until World War II, Alabama, like many Southern states, suffered economic hardship, in part because of continued dependence on agriculture. Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, [[White American|White]] rural interests dominated the state legislature until the 1960s, while urban interests and African Americans were under-represented.&lt;ref name=&quot;pjhwpa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20071017192719/http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm |archivedate=October 17, 2007 |title=George Mason University, United States Election Project: Alabama Redistricting Summary. Retrieved March 10, 2008 |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; African Americans and poor whites were essentially disfranchised in 1901, a status that continued until after 1965. 

Following World War II, Alabama experienced growth as the economy of the state transitioned from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests. The establishment or expansion of multiple [[United States Armed Forces]] installations added to the state economy and helped bridge the gap between an agricultural and industrial economy during the mid-20th century. The state economy in the 21st century is dependent on management, automotive, finance, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;alaindustrial&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.dir.alabama.gov/projections/Occupational/Proj2018/Statewide/alabama2008_2018.pdf |title=Alabama Occupational Projections 2008-2018 |work=Alabama Department of Industrial Relations |publisher=State of Alabama |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alabama is unofficially nicknamed the ''[[Northern Flicker|Yellowhammer]] State'', after the [[List of U.S. state birds|state bird]]. Alabama is also known as the &quot;[[Dixie|Heart of Dixie]]&quot;. The [[List of U.S. state trees|state tree]] is the [[Longleaf Pine]], and the [[List of U.S. state flowers|state flower]] is the [[Camellia]]. The capital of Alabama is [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]]. The largest city by population is [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]].&lt;ref name=&quot;quickcensus&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/01000.html |title=Alabama |work=QuickFacts |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest city by total land area is [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]]. The oldest city is [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], founded by French [[colonists]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pelican&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomason|first=Michael|title=Mobile: The New History of Alabama's First City|year=2001|publisher=University of Alabama Press|location=Tuscaloosa|isbn=0-8173-1065-7|pages=2–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Russel Cave Entrance RUCA9323.jpg|thumb|left|One of the entrances to [[Russell Cave National Monument|Russell Cave]] in Jackson County. Charcoal from indigenous camp fires in the cave has been dated as early as 6550 to 6145 BC.]]
The [[Alabama people]], a [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean-speaking tribe]] whose members lived just below the confluence of the [[Coosa River|Coosa]] and [[Tallapoosa River|Tallapoosa]] rivers on the upper reaches of the [[Alabama River]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Read&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Read |first=William A. |title=Indian Place Names in Alabama |year=1984 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |isbn=0-8173-0231-X |oclc=10724679 }}&lt;/ref&gt; were the origin of later European-American naming of the river and state. In the [[Alabama language]], the word for an Alabama person is ''Albaamo'' (or variously ''Albaama'' or ''Albàamo'' in different dialects; the plural form is ''Albaamaha'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Sylestine, Cora; Hardy; Heather; and [[Timothy Montler|Montler, Timothy]] |title=Dictionary of the Alabama Language |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin |year=1993 |isbn=0-292-73077-2 |url=http://www.ling.unt.edu/~montler/Alabama/ |oclc=26590560 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''Alabama'' is believed to have come from the related [[Choctaw language]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Rogers&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rogers |first=William W.|author2=Robert D. Ward|author3=Leah R. Atkins|author4=Wayne Flynt |title=Alabama: the History of a Deep South State |year=1994 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |isbn=0-8173-0712-5 |oclc=28634588 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was adopted by the Alabama tribe as their name.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.alabama.gov/statenam.html |title=Alabama: The State Name |accessdate=August 2, 2007|work=All About Alabama |publisher=Alabama Department of Archives and History |archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20070628215841/http://www.archives.alabama.gov/statenam.html |archivedate= June 28, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The spelling of the word varies significantly among historical sources.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;/&gt;  The first usage appears in three accounts of the [[Hernando de Soto]] expedition of 1540 with [[Garcilaso de la Vega (chronicler)|Garcilaso de la Vega]] using ''Alibamo'', while the Knight of Elvas and Rodrigo Ranjel wrote ''Alibamu'' and ''Limamu'', respectively, in efforts to [[transliterate]] the term.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;/&gt;  As early as 1702, the French called the tribe the ''Alibamon,'' with French maps identifying the river as ''Rivière des Alibamons''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Read&quot;/&gt;  Other spellings of the appellation have included ''Alibamu'', ''Alabamo'', ''Albama'', ''Alebamon'', ''Alibama'', ''Alibamou'', ''Alabamu'', and ''Allibamou''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wills&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wills |first=Charles A. |title=A Historical Album of Alabama |year=1995 |publisher=The Millbrook Press |isbn=1-56294-591-2 |oclc=32242468 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Griffith&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Griffith |first=Lucille |title=Alabama: A Documentary History to 1900|year=1972 |publisher=University of Alabama Press|isbn=0-8173-0371-5 |oclc=17530914 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weiss&quot;&gt;The use of state names derived from [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]] is common; an estimated 27&amp;nbsp;states have names of Native American origin. {{Cite book|last=Weiss |first=Sonia |title= The Complete Idiot's Guide to Baby Names |year=1999 |publisher=Mcmillan USA |isbn=0-02-863367-9 |oclc=222611214 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sources disagree on the meaning of the word. An 1842 article in the ''Jacksonville Republican'' proposed that it meant &quot;Here We Rest.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;/&gt; This notion was popularized in the 1850s through the writings of [[Alexander Beaufort Meek]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;/&gt; Experts in the [[Muskogean languages]] have been unable to find any evidence to support such a translation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Read&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;/&gt;

Scholars believe the word comes from the Choctaw ''alba'' (meaning &quot;plants&quot; or &quot;weeds&quot;) and ''amo'' (meaning &quot;to cut&quot;, &quot;to trim&quot;, or &quot;to gather&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Rogers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Swanton1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swanton |first=John R. |authorlink=John R.

===Pre-European settlement===

[[Indigenous peoples]] of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before European colonization. Trade with the northeastern tribes via the [[Ohio River]] began during the Burial Mound Period (1000&amp;nbsp;BC–AD&amp;nbsp;700) and continued until [[European colonization of the Americas|European contact]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NewYorkTimesAlmanac&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url= http://travel2.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/travel/NYT_ALMANAC_US_ALABAMA.html |title= Alabama |date= August 11, 2006 |work= The New York Times Almanac 2004 |accessdate= September 23, 2006 |archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20060926105134/http://travel2.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/travel/NYT_ALMANAC_US_ALABAMA.html |archivedate= September 26, 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agrarian [[Mississippian culture]] covered most of the state from 1000 to 1600 AD, with one of its major centers built at what is now the [[Moundville Archaeological Site]] in [[Moundville, Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Welch |first= Paul D. |title= Moundville's Economy |publisher= University of Alabama Press |year= 1991 |isbn= 0-8173-0512-2 |oclc= 21330955 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Walthall |first= John A. |title= Prehistoric Indians of the Southeast-Archaeology of Alabama and the Middle South |publisher= University of Alabama Press |year= 1990 |isbn= 0-8173-0552-1 |oclc= 26656858 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] recovered from [[archaeological]] excavations at Moundville were the basis of scholars' formulating the characteristics of the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]] (SECC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Townsend |first= Richard F. |title= [[Hero, Hawk, and Open Hand]] |publisher= Yale University Press |year= 2004 |isbn= 0-300-10601-7 |oclc= 56633574 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to popular belief, the SECC appears to have no direct links to [[Mesoamerica]]n culture, but developed independently.

Among the historical tribes of Native American people living in the area of present-day Alabama at the time of European contact were the [[Cherokee]], an [[Iroquoian language]] people; and the [[Muskogean]]-speaking [[Alabama (people)|Alabama]] (''Alibamu''), [[Chickasaw]], [[Choctaw]], [[Creek people|Creek]], and [[Koasati]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/alabama/ |title= Alabama Indian Tribes |accessdate =September 23, 2006 |date= Updated 2006 |work= Indian Tribal Records |publisher= AccessGenealogy.com |archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20061012073735/http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/alabama/ |archivedate= October 12, 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; While part of the same large language family, the Muskogee tribes developed distinct cultures and languages.

===European settlement===

With exploration in the 16th century, the Spanish were the first Europeans to reach Alabama. The expedition of [[Hernando de Soto]] passed through [[Mabila]] and other parts of the state in 1540. More than 160 years later, the French founded the first European settlement in the region at [[Old Mobile Site|Old Mobile]] in 1702.&lt;ref name=&quot;US50&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.theus50.com/alabama/ |title= Alabama State History |accessdate=September 23, 2006 |publisher= theUS50.com |archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20060825052401/http://www.theus50.com/alabama/ |archivedate= August 25, 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was moved to the current site of [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] in 1711. This area was claimed by the French from 1702 to 1763 as part of [[La Louisiane]].&lt;ref name=alahisttmln/&gt;

After the French lost to the British in the [[Seven Years' War]], it became part of British [[West Florida]] from 1763 to 1783. After the United States victory in the [[American Revolutionary War]], the territory was divided between the United States and Spain. The latter retained control of this western territory from 1783 until the surrender of the Spanish garrison at Mobile to U.S. forces on April 13, 1813.&lt;ref name=alahisttmln&gt;{{cite web|title=Alabama History Timeline|url=http://www.archives.alabama.gov/timeline/al1801.html|publisher=Alabama Department of Archives and History|accessdate=July 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;annexed1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomason|first=Michael|title=Mobile: The New History of Alabama's First City|year=2001|publisher=University of Alabama Press|location=Tuscaloosa|isbn=0-8173-1065-7|pages=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Bassett, a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist]] to the British monarchy during the Revolutionary era, was one of the earliest White settlers in the state outside of Mobile. He settled in the [[Tombigbee District]] during the early 1770s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.state.al.us/aha/markers/washington.html |title=Alabama Historical Association Marker Program: Washington County |publisher=Archives.state.al.us |accessdate=June 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boundaries of the district were roughly limited to the area within a few miles of the [[Tombigbee River]] and included portions of what is today southern [[Clarke County, Alabama|Clarke County]], northernmost [[Mobile County, Alabama|Mobile County]], and most of [[Washington County, Alabama|Washington County]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oldsw&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Old Southwest 1795–1830: Frontiers in Conflict |last=Clark |first=Thomas D. |author2=John D.

What is now the counties of [[Baldwin County, Alabama|Baldwin]] and [[Mobile County, Alabama|Mobile]] became part of [[Spanish West Florida]] in 1783, part of the independent [[Republic of West Florida]] in 1810, and was finally added to the [[Mississippi Territory]] in 1812. Most of what is now the northern two-thirds of Alabama was known as the [[Yazoo lands]] beginning during the British colonial period. It was claimed by the [[Province of Georgia]] from 1767 onwards. Following the [[American Revolution|Revolutionary War]], it remained a part of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], although heavily disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cadle|first=Farris W|title=Georgia Land Surveying History and Law|year=1991|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens, Ga.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pickett&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Pickett|first=Albert James|title=History of Alabama and incidentally of Georgia and Mississippi, from the earliest period|year=1851|publisher=Walker and James|location=Charleston|pages=408–428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mississippiterritory.PNG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Map showing the formation of the Mississippi and Alabama territories]]

With the exception of the immediate area around Mobile and the Yazoo lands, what is now the lower one-third Alabama was made part of the Mississippi Territory when it was organized in 1798. The Yazoo lands were added to the territory in 1804, following the [[Yazoo land scandal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pickett&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pine Barrens Speculation and Yazoo Land Fraud|url=http://www.aboutnorthgeorgia.com/ang/The_Pine_Barrens_Speculation_and_Yazoo_Land_Fraud|publisher=About North Georgia|accessdate=July 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain kept a claim on its former Spanish West Florida territory in what would become the coastal counties until the [[Adams–Onís Treaty]] officially ceded it to the United States in 1819.&lt;ref name=&quot;annexed1&quot;/&gt;

===19th century===

Prior to the admission of [[Mississippi]] as a state on December 10, 1817, the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the [[Alabama Territory]]. The Alabama Territory was created by the [[United States Congress]] on March 3, 1817. [[St. Stephens, Alabama|St. Stephens]], now abandoned, served as the territorial capital from 1817 to 1819.&lt;ref name=&quot;eoaststephens&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1674 |title=Old St. Stephens |work=Encyclopedia of Alabama |publisher=Auburn University |accessdate=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Congress selected Huntsville as the site for the first Constitutional Convention of Alabama after it was approved to become the 22nd state. From July 5 to August 2, 1819, delegates met to prepare the new state constitution. Huntsville served as the temporary capital of Alabama from 1819 to 1820, when the seat of state government was moved to [[Cahaba, Alabama|Cahaba]] in [[Dallas County, Alabama|Dallas County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Huntsville |url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-2498 |work=The Encyclopedia of Alabama |publisher= Alabama Humanities Foundation |accessdate=January 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1826 to 1846, [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]] served as the capital of Alabama. On January 30, 1846, the Alabama legislature announced that it had voted to move the capital city from Tuscaloosa to [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]]. The first legislative session in the new capital met in December 1847.&lt;ref name=&quot;capitols&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.state.al.us/capital/capitals.html |title=Capitals of Alabama |work=Alabama Department of Archives and History |accessdate=July 8, 2011 |archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20110716220255/http://www.archives.state.al.us/capital/capitals.html |archivedate= July 16, 2011 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new capitol building was erected under the direction of [[Stephen Decatur Button]] of [[Philadelphia]].

By 1860, the population had increased to a total of 964,201 people, of which nearly half, 435,080 were enslaved African Americans, and 2,690 were [[free people of color]].&lt;ref name=&quot;adahtmln&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.alabama.gov/timeline/al1801.html |title=Alabama History Timeline |work=Alabama Department of Archives and History |publisher=State of Alabama |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 11, 1861, Alabama declared its [[Secession in the United States|secession]] from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].  After remaining an independent republic for a few days, it joined the [[Confederate States of America]]. The Confederacy's capital was initially located at [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]].  Alabama was heavily [[Alabama in the American Civil War|involved in the American Civil War]].  Although comparatively few battles were fought in the state, Alabama contributed about 120,000 soldiers to the war effort.

A company of cavalry soldiers from Huntsville, Alabama joined [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]]'s battalion in [[Hopkinsville, Kentucky]].  The company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves, collar and coat tails. This led to them being greeted with &quot;Yellowhammer&quot;, and the name later was applied to all Alabama troops in the Confederate Army.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archives.state.al.us/emblems/st_bird.html Official Symbols and Emblems of Alabama, State Bird of Alabama, Yellowhammer].

From 1867 to 1874, with most White citizens barred temporarily from voting, many African Americans emerged as political leaders in the state. Alabama was represented in Congress during this period by three African-American congressmen: [[Jeremiah Haralson]], [[Benjamin S. Turner]], and [[James T. Rapier]].&lt;ref name=&quot;alrecnstrctn&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alabamamoments.state.al.us/sec24.html |title=Reconstruction in Alabama: A Quick Summary |work=Alabama Moments in American History |publisher=Alabama Department of Archives and History |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the war, the state remained chiefly agricultural, with an economy tied to cotton. During [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], state legislators ratified a [[Constitution of Alabama|new state constitution]] in 1868 that created a public school system for the first time and expanded women's rights. Legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects, although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation.&lt;ref name=&quot;alrecnstrctn&quot;/&gt; Organized [[insurgent]], resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and Republicans. Besides the short-lived original [[Ku Klux Klan]], these included the Pale Faces, [[Knights of the White Camellia]], [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], and the [[White League]].&lt;ref name=&quot;alrecnstrctn&quot;/&gt;

Reconstruction in Alabama ended in 1874, when the Democrats regained control of the legislature and governor's office. They wrote another constitution in 1875,&lt;ref name=&quot;alrecnstrctn&quot;/&gt; and the legislature passed the [[Blaine Amendment]], prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious-affiliated schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schoolreport.com/schoolreport/articles/blaine_7_00.htm |title=A Blaine Amendment Update (July 00) |publisher=Schoolreport.com |accessdate=June 1, 2011 |archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20110716014339/http://www.schoolreport.com/schoolreport/articles/blaine_7_00.htm |archivedate= July 16, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, legislation was approved that called for [[racial segregation|racially segregated]] schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;jimcrowala&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.classroomhelp.com/till/jimcrowlaws/jimcrowalabama.html |title=Jim Crow Laws in Alabama |work=Emmett Till, It All Began with a Whistle |publisher=Classroomhelp |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Railroad passenger cars were segregated in 1891.&lt;ref name=&quot;jimcrowala&quot;/&gt; More [[Jim Crow laws]] were passed at the beginning of the 20th century to enforce segregation in everyday life.

[[File:Birmingham Alabama skyline 1915.jpg|thumb|left|The developing skyline of Birmingham in 1915]]
The new 1901 [[Constitution of Alabama]] included electoral laws that effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] African Americans, Native Americans, and most poor Whites through voting restrictions, including [[Poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]] and [[literacy test]] requirements.&lt;ref&gt;J. Morgan Kousser.''The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; While the planter class had persuaded poor Whites to support these legislative efforts, the new restrictions resulted in their disfranchisement as well, due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative [[poll tax]].&lt;ref name=&quot;epzzsd&quot;/&gt;

In 1900, Alabama had more than 181,000 African Americans eligible to vote. By 1903, only 2,980 were qualified to register, although at least 74,000 African-American voters were [[literate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;epzzsd&quot;/&gt; By 1941, more White Alabamians than African-American residents had been disfranchised: a total of 600,000 Whites to 520,000 African Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;epzzsd&quot;&gt;Glenn Feldman. ''The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama''. Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all African Americans had lost the ability to vote, a situation that persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the 1965 to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens.

The 1901 constitution reiterated that schools be racially segregated. It also restated that interracial marriage was illegal, although such marriages had been made illegal in 1867. Further racial segregation laws were passed related to public facilities into the 1950s: jails were segregated in 1911; hospitals in 1915; toilets, hotels, and restaurants in 1928; and bus stop waiting rooms in 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;jimcrowala&quot;/&gt;

The rural-dominated Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disfranchised African Americans, but it did not relieve them of paying taxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSpaces&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://southernspaces.org/2004/black-belt |title= The Black Belt |accessdate =September 23, 2006 |date= April 19, 2004 |work= Southern Spaces Internet Journal |publisher= Emory University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for African Americans in the South, the [[Rosenwald Fund]] began funding the construction of what came to be known as [[Rosenwald School]]s. In Alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with Rosenwald funds, which paid one-third of the construction costs. The local community and state raised matching funds to pay the rest. Black residents effectively taxed themselves twice, by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools, which were built in many rural areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;rosenwaldal&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rosenwald School Building Fund and Associated Buildings MPS|work=&quot;National Register Information System&quot; |url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Text/64500011.pdf |accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mount Sinai School Autauga County July 2011 1.jpg|thumb|The former [[Mount Sinai School]] in rural Autauga County, completed in 1919.  It was one of the 387 Rosenwald Schools built in the state.]]

Beginning in 1913, the first 80 [[Rosenwald School]]s were built in Alabama for African-American children. A total of 387 schools, seven teacher's houses, and several vocational buildings had been completed in the state by 1937. Several of the [[The Rosenwald School Building Fund and Associated Buildings Multiple Property Submission|surviving school buildings]] in the state are now listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rosenwaldal&quot;/&gt;

Continued racial discrimination, agricultural depression, and the failure of the cotton crops due to [[boll weevil]] infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans to seek opportunities in northern cities. They left Alabama in the early 20th century as part of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to industrial jobs and better futures in northern and midwestern industrial cities. Reflecting this emigration, the population growth rate in Alabama (see &quot;Historical Populations&quot; table below) dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920.

At the same time, many rural people, both White and African American, moved to the city of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] to work in new industrial jobs. Birmingham experienced such rapid growth that it was called &quot;The Magic City&quot;. By the 1920s, Birmingham was the 19th-largest city in the United States and had more than 30% of the Alabama's population. Heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhamwiki.com/w/Birmingham |title=Birmingham |publisher=Bhamwiki |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its residents were under-represented for decades in the state legislature, which refused to redistrict to recognize demographic changes, such as urbanization.

Industrial development related to the demands of World War II brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the Civil War.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSpaces&quot;/&gt;  Rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living. One example of this massive influx of workers can be shown by what happened in Mobile. Between 1940 and 1943, more than 89,000 people moved into the city to work for war effort industries.&lt;ref name=&quot;thomason2&quot;&gt;Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city'', pages 213–217. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0-8173-1065-7&lt;/ref&gt; Cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base.

Despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population. They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas. In addition, the state legislature gerrymandered the few Birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside Birmingham.

[[File:SelmaHeschelMarch.jpg|thumb|left|The third [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma to Montgomery march]], one of the seminal events of the civil rights movement in Alabama.]]
One result was that Jefferson County, containing Birmingham's industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services. Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature. A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination, &quot;a minority of about 25 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pjhwpa&quot;/&gt;

African Americans were presumed partial to Republicans for historical reasons, but they were disfranchised. White Alabamans felt bitter towards the Republican Party in the aftermath of the Civil War and Reconstruction. These factors created a longstanding tradition that any candidate who wanted to be viable with White voters had to run as a Democrat regardless of political beliefs.

Although efforts had already started decades earlier, African Americans began to press to end disfranchisement and segregation in the state during the 1950s and 1960s with the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|Civil Rights Movement]]. In 1954 the US Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' that public schools had to be desegregated, but Alabama was slow to comply. The civil rights movement raised national awareness of the issues, leading to the enactment of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] by the U.S. Congress. During the 1960s, under Governor [[George Wallace]], failed attempts were made at the state level to resist federally sanctioned [[desegregation]] efforts.

During the Civil Rights Movement, African Americans achieved enforcement of voting and other civil constitutional rights through the passage of the national [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]],&lt;ref name=&quot;cra64&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 |title=Civil Rights Act of 1964 |publisher=Finduslaw.com |accessdate=October 24, 2010 |archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20101021141154/http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 |archivedate= October 21, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].

Under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, cases were filed in Federal courts to force Alabama to redistrict by population both the House and Senate of the state legislature. In 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature implemented the Alabama constitution's provision for periodic redistricting based on population. This benefited the urban areas that had developed, as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than 60 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;pjhwpa&quot;/&gt;

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Alabama}}
[[File:Birmingham city hall alabama 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Snowfall outside Birmingham City Hall in February 2010.]]

The state is classified as [[humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] (''Cfa'') under the [[Humid temperate climate|Koppen Climate Classification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://facstaff.unca.edu/cgodfrey/courses/atms179/ppt/greenhouse.pdf |title=Greenhouse effect and climate |author=Christopher M. Godfrey |date=November 4, 2008 |work=Atmospheric Sciences |publisher=University of North Carolina, Asheville }}&lt;/ref&gt; The average annual temperature is 64&amp;nbsp;°F (18&amp;nbsp;°C). Temperatures tend to be warmer in the southern part of the state with its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, while the northern parts of the state, especially in the Appalachian Mountains in the northeast, tend to be slightly cooler.&lt;ref name=&quot;cprgsw&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-78303/Alabama |title=Alabama Climate |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, Alabama has very hot summers and mild winters with copious precipitation throughout the year. Alabama receives an average of {{convert|56|in|mm}} of rainfall annually and enjoys a lengthy growing season of up to 300&amp;nbsp;days in the southern part of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;cprgsw&quot;/&gt;

Summers in Alabama are among the hottest in the U.S., with high temperatures averaging over {{convert|90|°F}} throughout the summer in some parts of the state. Alabama is also prone to [[tropical storm]]s and even [[hurricane]]s. Areas of the state far away from the Gulf are not immune to the effects of the storms, which often dump tremendous amounts of rain as they move inland and weaken.

South Alabama reports many [[thunderstorms]]. The Gulf Coast, around Mobile Bay, averages between 70 and 80 days per year with thunder reported. This activity decreases somewhat further north in the state, but even the far north of the state reports thunder on about 60&amp;nbsp;days per year. Occasionally, thunderstorms are severe with frequent [[lightning]] and large [[hail]]; the central and northern parts of the state are most vulnerable to this type of storm. Alabama ranks seventh in the number of deaths from lightning and ninth in the number of deaths from lightning strikes per capita.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightningsafety.com/nlsi_lls/fatalities_us.html Lightning Fatalities, Injuries and Damages in the United States, 1990–2003]. NLSI. Retrieved May 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alabama, along with [[Kansas]], has the most reported [[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF5 tornadoes]] of any state, according to statistics from the [[National Climatic Data Center]] for the period January 1, 1950, to October 31, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tornadoproject.com/fscale/fscale.htm Fujita scale]. Tornadoproject.com. Retrieved September 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Several long-tracked F5 tornadoes have contributed to Alabama reporting more tornado fatalities than any other state, even surpassing Texas which has a much larger area within [[Tornado Alley]]. The state suffered tremendous damage in the [[Super Outbreak]] of April 1974, and the [[April 25–28, 2011 tornado outbreak]]. The outbreak in April 2011 produced a record amount of tornadoes in the state. The tally reached 62.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Oliver |first=Mike |title=April 27's record tally: 62 tornadoes in Alabama |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2011/08/april_27s_record_tally_62_torn.html |publisher=al.com |accessdate=November 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The peak season for tornadoes varies from the northern to southern parts of the state. Alabama is one of the few places in the world that has a secondary tornado season in November and December, along with the spring severe weather season. The northern part of the state—along the Tennessee Valley—is one of the areas in the U.S. most vulnerable to violent tornadoes. The area of Alabama and Mississippi most affected by tornadoes is sometimes referred to as [[Dixie Alley]], as distinct from the [[Tornado Alley]] of the Southern Plains.

Winters are generally mild in Alabama, as they are throughout most of the southeastern U.S., with average January low temperatures around {{convert|40|°F}} in Mobile and around {{convert|32|°F}} in Birmingham. Although snow is a rare event in much of Alabama, areas of the state north of Montgomery may receive a dusting of snow a few times every winter, with an occasional moderately heavy snowfall every few years. Historic snowfall events include [[New Year's Eve 1963 snowstorm]] and the [[1993 Storm of the Century]]. The annual average snowfall for the Birmingham area is {{convert|2|in|mm}} per year. In the southern Gulf coast, snowfall is less frequent, sometimes going several years without any snowfall.

Alabama's highest temperature of {{convert|112|°F}} was recorded on September 5, 1925 in the unincorporated community of [[Centerville, Alabama|Centerville]]. The record low of {{convert|-27|°F}} occurred on January 30, 1966 in [[New Market, Alabama|New Market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accuracyproject.org/recordtemps.html |title=Record high and low temperatures for all 50 states |work=Internet Accuracy Project |publisher=accuracyproject.org |accessdate=November 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on historic migration and settlement patterns in the southern colonies and states, demographers estimated there are more people in Alabama of Scots-Irish origins than self-reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=04000US01&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2008_3YR_G00_DP3YR2&amp;-ds_name=&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-redoLog=false |title=American FactFinder |publisher=Factfinder.census.gov |accessdate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many people in Alabama claim Irish ancestry because of the term Scots-Irish but, based on historic immigration and settlement, their ancestors were more likely Protestant Scots-Irish coming from northern Ireland, where they had been for a few generations as part of the English colonization.&lt;ref name=&quot;census-ancestries&quot;&gt;[[Media:Census-2000-Data-Top-US-Ancestries-by-County.jpg|Census 2000 Map – Top U.S. Ancestries by County]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Scots-Irish were the largest non-English immigrant group from the British Isles before the American Revolution, and many settled in the South, later moving into the Deep South as it was developed.&lt;ref&gt;David Hackett Fischer, Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America, New York: Oxford University Press, 1989, pp.361–368&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, under the Davis–Strong Act, the state legislature established the [[Alabama Indian Affairs Commission]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aiac&quot;&gt;[http://www.aiac.state.al.us/tribes.aspx &quot;Alabama Indian Affairs Commission&quot;], State of Alabama, accessed September 28, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Native American groups within the state had increasingly been demanding recognition as ethnic groups and seeking an end to discrimination. Given the long history of slavery and associated racial segregation, the Native American peoples, who have sometimes been of mixed race, have insisted on having their cultural identification respected. In the past, their self-identification was often overlooked as the state tried to impose a binary breakdown of society into white and black.

The state has [[State recognized tribes in the United States|officially recognized]] nine American Indian tribes in the state, descended mostly from the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] of the American Southeast. These are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aiac.alabama.gov/ByLaws.aspx |title=AIAC Bylaws |work=Alabama Indian Affairs Commission |publisher=State of Alabama |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Poarch Band of Creek Indians]] (who also have federal recognition), 
*[[MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians]],
*Star Clan of [[Muscogee Creek people|Muscogee Creek]]s, 
*Echota Cherokee Tribe of Alabama, 
*[[Cherokee Tribe of Northeast Alabama]], 
*Cher-O-Creek Intra Tribal Indians, 
*''Ma-Chis'' Lower Creek Indian Tribe, 
*''Piqua'' [[Shawnee]] Tribe, and 
*''Ani-Yun-Wiya'' Nation.

The state government has promoted recognition of Native American contributions to the state, including the designation in 2000 for Columbus Day to be jointly celebrated as American Indian Heritage Day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aiac.state.al.us/ProcIndianHeritageDay.aspx &quot;American Indian Heritage Day&quot;, Alabama Indian Affairs Commission, 2000, accessed 28 September 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alabama is located in the middle of the [[Bible Belt]], a region of numerous Protestant Christians. Alabama has been identified as one of the most religious states in the US, with about 58% of the population attending church regularly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060502/news_lz1n2thelist.html US Church attendance]&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of people in the state identify as Evangelical Protestant. As of 2010, the three largest denominational groups in Alabama are the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], [[The United Methodist Church]], and non-denominational Evangelical Protestant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/s/01/rcms2010_01_state_name_2010.asp |title=The Association of Religion Data Archives &amp;#124; State membership Report |publisher=www.thearda.com |accessdate=November 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Alabama, the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] has the highest number of adherents with 1,380,121; this is followed by the [[United Methodist Church]] with 327,734 adherents, non-denominational Evangelical Protestant with 220,938 adherents, and the Catholic Church with 150,647 adherents. Many Baptist and Methodist congregations became established in the [[Great Awakening]] of the early 19th century, when preachers proselytized across the South. The [[Assemblies of God]] had almost 60,000 members, the [[Churches of Christ]] had nearly 120,000 members. The [[Presbyterian church]]es, strongly associated with Scots-Irish immigrants of the 18th century and their descendants, had a combined membership around 75,000 ([[Presbyterian Church in America|PCA]]-24,020 members in 108 congregations, [[PC(USA)]]-36,000 members in 147 congregations, the [[Cumberland Presbyterian Church]]-6,000 members in 58 congregations, the [[Cumberland Presbyterian Church in America]]-5,000 members and 50 congreagtions plus the [[Edgewater Presbyterian Church|EPC]] and Associate Reformed Presbyterians with 230 members and 9 congregations).&lt;ref name=&quot;thearda&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thearda.com/mapsReports/reports/state/01_2000.asp |title=State Membership Reports |year= 2000 |accessdate=June 15, 2010 |publisher= thearda.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 survey, nearly 70% of respondents could name all four of the Christian [[Canonical Gospels|Gospels]].

In contrast to the primarily agricultural economy of the previous century, this was only about 1% of the state's gross domestic product. The number of private farms has declined at a steady rate since the 1960s, as land has been sold to developers, timber companies, and large farming conglomerates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-2330 |title=Food Production in Alabama |last1=Ijaz |first1=Ahmad |last2=Addy |first2=Samuel N. |date=July 6, 2009 |work=The Encyclopedia of Alabama |publisher=Auburn University |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located in the state are [[Honda Manufacturing of Alabama]], [[Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama]], [[Mercedes-Benz U.S. International]], and [[Toyota Motor Manufacturing Alabama]], as well as their various suppliers. Since 1993, the automobile industry has generated more than 67,800 new jobs in the state.

==Law and government==

===State government===
[[File:Alabama Capitol Building.jpg|thumb|The [[Alabama State Capitol|State Capitol Building]] in Montgomery, completed in 1851,]]
{{Main|Government of Alabama}}

The foundational document for Alabama's government is the [[Alabama Constitution]], which was ratified in 1901. At almost 800 amendments and 310,000 words, it is the world's longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the [[U.S. Constitution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Washington Post&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A16443-2004Nov27?language=printer |last= Roig-Franzia |first= Manuel |title= Alabama Vote Opens Old Racial Wounds |work=The Washington Post |date= November 28, 2004 |accessdate= September 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Constitution&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislature.state.al.us/CodeOfAlabama/Constitution/1901/Constitution1901_toc.htm |title= Constitution of Alabama – 1901 |work= The Alabama Legislative Information System |accessdate= September 22, 2006 |archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20060923081542/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/CodeOfAlabama/Constitution/1901/Constitution1901_toc.htm |archivedate= September 23, 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There has been a significant movement to rewrite and modernize Alabama's constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.constitutionalreform.org/ |title=Alabama Citizens for Constitutional Reform |publisher=Constitutionalreform.org |accessdate=October 24, 2010| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20100915165938/http://www.constitutionalreform.org/ |archivedate= September 15, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This movement is based upon the fact that Alabama's constitution highly centralizes power in Montgomery and leaves practically no power in local hands. Any policy changes proposed around the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length were intentional to codify segregation and racism.

[[File:Ala Supreme Court Building Feb 2012 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Alabama Judicial Building]] in Montgomery. It houses the [[Alabama Supreme Court]], [[Alabama Court of Civil Appeals]], and [[Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals]].]]

Alabama's government is divided into three equal branches:
The [[legislative branch]] is the [[Alabama Legislature]], a [[bicameral]] assembly composed of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]], with 105 members, and the [[Alabama Senate]], with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. The [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] currently holds a majority in both houses of the [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]]. The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).

The [[executive branch]] is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws. It is headed by the [[Governor of Alabama]]. Other members of executive branch include the cabinet, the [[Attorney General of Alabama]], the [[Alabama Secretary of State]], the [[Alabama State Treasurer]], and the [[State Auditor of Alabama]]. The current [[Governor of Alabama|governor]] of the state is [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Robert J. Bentley|Robert Bentley]]. The [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Alabama|lieutenant governor]] is Republican [[Kay Ivey]].

The [[judicial branch]] is responsible for interpreting the [[Alabama Constitution|Constitution]] and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases. The highest court is the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]]. The Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court is Republican [[Roy Moore]]. All sitting justices on the Alabama Supreme Court are members of the Republican Party.

The members of the Legislature take office immediately after the November elections. The statewide officials, such as the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, and other constitutional offices take office in the following January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislature.state.al.us/misc/legislativeprocess/legislativeprocess_ml.html|title= Alabama's Legislative Process |first= McDowell |last= Lee|year= 2009|publisher= State of Alabama}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxes===
Alabama levies a 2, 4, or 5 percent personal income tax, depending upon the amount earned and filing status. Taxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their Alabama state tax, and can do so even if taking the standard deduction. Taxpayers who file itemized deductions are also allowed to deduct federal Social Security and Medicare taxes.

The state's general sales tax rate is 4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Wayback|date=20070520231150 |url=http://www.taxadmin.org/fta/rate/sl_sales.html |title=Comparison of State and Local Retail Sales Taxes}}. taxadmin.org, July 2004, Retrieved December 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sales tax rates for cities and counties are also added to purchases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://revenue.alabama.gov/publications/business-taxes/sales/Sales_Tax--Sales_Tax_Brochure.pdf Sales Tax Brochure]. State of Alabama. Retrieved December 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the total sales tax rate in Mobile is 10% and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1%, which means that a diner in Mobile would pay a 11% tax on a meal. {{As of|1999}}, sales and excise taxes in Alabama account for 51% of all state and local revenue, compared with an average of about 36% nationwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbpp.org&quot;/&gt; Alabama is one of 15 states that levies a tax on food at the same rate as other goods. Alabama's income tax on poor working families is among the highest in the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbpp.org&quot;/&gt; Alabama is the only state that levies income tax on a family of four with income as low as $4,600, which is barely one-quarter of the federal poverty line.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbpp.org&quot;/&gt; Alabama's threshold is the lowest among the 41 states and the District of Columbia with income taxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbpp.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=1812 |title=Reducing Alabama's Income Tax on Working-Poor Families: Two Options |date= April 14, 1999 |publisher=Cbpp.org |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The corporate income tax rate is currently 6.5%. The overall federal, state, and local tax burden in Alabama ranks the state as the second least tax-burdened state in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taxfoundation.org/files/sl_burden_alabama-2007-04-04.pdf |title=Alabama State Local Tax Burden Compared to U.S. Average (1970–2007) |accessdate=May 30, 2007 |format=PDF |work=Tax Foundation|archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20070605100516/http://www.taxfoundation.org/files/sl_burden_alabama-2007-04-04.pdf| archivedate= June 5, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Property tax]]es are the lowest in the U.S. The current state constitution requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes.

Since Alabama's tax structure largely depends on consumer spending, it is subject to high variable budget structure. For example, in 2003 Alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as $670&amp;nbsp;million.

===Local and county government===
{{Alabama County Labelled Map|align=right|width=300}}
{{see also|List of counties in Alabama}}

Alabama has 67 [[county (United States)|counties]]. Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the county commission, which normally also has executive authority in the county. Because of the restraints placed in the [[Alabama Constitution]], all but seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have little to no [[home rule]]. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies such as waste disposal to land use zoning.

On November 9, 2011, Jefferson County declared bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jeffconline.jccal.org/home/news/photo/1517060216/ News - View Article]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/business/jefferson-county-ala-falls-off-the-bankruptcy-cliff.html |work=The New York Times |title=Jefferson County, Ala., Falls Off the Bankruptcy Cliff |date=February 18, 2012 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alabama is an [[alcoholic beverage control state]]. The state government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol. Some counties and municipalities are &quot;dry&quot;, which bans all sales of alcohol in those areas.

===Politics===
[[File:Robert Bentley.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Robert J. Bentley]], governor since January 17, 2011.]]
[[File:Kay Ivey.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Kay Ivey]], lieutenant governor.]]

During [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] following the [[American Civil War]], Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the [[Third Military District]] under [[John Pope (military officer)|General John Pope]]. In 1874, the political coalition known as the [[Redeemers]] took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the African American vote.

After 1890, a coalition of White politicians passed laws to [[racial segregation|segregate]] and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disfranchised African Americans also disfranchised poor Whites, however. By 1941 more Whites than African Americans had been disfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000, although the impact was greater on the African-American community, as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law.

From 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state. The result was a rural minority that dominated state politics until a series of court cases required redistricting in 1972.

Alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|American Civil Rights Movement]], when racist Whites bureaucratically, and at times, violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform. Democrat [[George Wallace]], the state's only four-term governor, was a controversial figure. Only with the passage of the Federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]&lt;ref name=&quot;cra64&quot;/&gt; and [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965 did African Americans regain suffrage, among other civil rights.

In 2007, the [[Alabama Legislature]] passed, and Republican Governor [[Bob Riley]] signed a resolution expressing &quot;profound regret&quot; over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the [[Alabama State Capitol]], which housed Congress of the [[Confederate States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Phillip |last=Rawls |title=Alabama offers an apology for slavery |work=The Virginian Pilot |publisher=Landmark Communications |date=June 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southerner&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.southerner.net/v1n1_99/coverstory1.html |title= The New South Rises, Again |date= Spring 1999 |work= Civil Rights: Law and History |publisher= Southerner.net |accessdate =September 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elections===
{{main|Elections in Alabama}}

====State elections====
With the disfranchisement of African Americans, the state became part of the &quot;[[Solid South]]&quot;, a system in which the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] became essentially the only political party in every Southern state. For nearly 100&amp;nbsp;years, local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party [[primary election|primary]], with generally only token [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] challengers running in the General Election.

Republicans hold all nine seats on the [[Alabama Supreme Court]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2009/05/sue_bell_cobb_considering_runn.html |title=Sue Bell Cobb considering running for governor - Breaking News from The Birmingham News |publisher=Blog.al.com |date=May 2, 2009 |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all ten seats on the state appellate courts. Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats. This change also began, likely in part, due to the same perception by voters of Democratic party efforts to disenfranchise voters again in 1994. In that general election, the then-incumbent Chief Justice of Alabama, [[Ernest C. Hornsby]], refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican [[Perry O. Hooper, Sr.]]. Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court. This ultimately led to a collapse of support for Democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles. The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench.

Republicans hold all seven of the [[Political party strength in Alabama|statewide elected executive]] branch offices. Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the [[Alabama State Board of Education]]. In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years. Democrats hold one of the three seats on the Alabama Public Service Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |title=Commissioners |publisher=Psc.state.al.us |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Special |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |title= Lucy Baxley wins Alabama Public Service Commission presidency, but recount possible |publisher=Birmingham News via al.com |date=November 5, 2008 |accessdate=August 7, 2009| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20090802212747/http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html| archivedate= August 2, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeff Amy, Press-Register |url=http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |title=Public Service Commission: Twinkle Cavanaugh, Terry Dunn join GOP sweep |publisher= al.com |accessdate=June 1, 2011| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20110513135614/http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html| archivedate= May 13, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only two Republican Lieutenant Governors have been elected since Reconstruction, one is [[Kay Ivey]], the current Lieutenant Governor.

====Local elections====
Many local offices (County Commissioners, Boards of Education, Tax Assessors, Tax Collectors, etc.) in the state are still held by Democrats. Local elections in most rural counties are generally decided in the Democratic primary and local elections in metropolitan and suburban counties are generally decided in the Republican Primary, although there are exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=1&amp;year=2006&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=1 |title=2006 Gubernatorial Democratic Primary Election Results – Alabama |publisher=Uselectionatlas.org |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=1&amp;year=2006&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=2 |title=2006 Gubernatorial Republican Primary Election Results – Alabama |publisher=Uselectionatlas.org |date=February 15, 2007 |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alabama's 67 County Sheriffs are elected in partisan races and Democrats still retain the majority of those posts. The current split is 42 [[Alabama Democratic Party|Democrats]], 24 [[Alabama Republican Party|Republicans]], and one Independent (Choctaw).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011-2015 Alabama Sheriffs|url=http://alabamasheriffs.com/uploads/20130409/85e6648587de92a5a9886ebc22a20009.pdf|publisher=Alabama Sheriffs Association|accessdate=July 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, most of the Democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties and the majority of Republican sheriffs preside over more urban/suburban and heavily populated counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alabamasheriffs.com/?PageID=131&amp;IsNav=true |title=Association |publisher=Alabama Sheriffs |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two Alabama counties (Montgomery and Calhoun) with a population of over 100,000 have Democratic sheriffs and five [[Counties of Alabama|Alabama counties]] with a population of under 75,000 have Republican sheriffs (Autauga, Coffee, Dale, Coosa, and Blount).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alabamasheriffs.com/Image.aspx?ImageID=11481&amp;Title=2007-2011+Alabama+Sheriffs |title=2007–2011 Alabama Sheriffs |publisher=Alabamasheriffs.com |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, the state of Alabama has one female sheriff, in [[Morgan County, Alabama]], and nine African American sheriffs.&lt;ref&gt;Alabama Sheriffs Association&lt;/ref&gt;

====Federal elections====
The state's two [[United States Senate|U.S. senators]] are [[Jeff Sessions|Jefferson B. Sessions III]] and [[Richard Shelby|Richard C. Shelby]], both Republicans. Shelby was originally elected to the Senate as a Democrat in 1986 and re-elected in 1992, but switched parties in November 1994.

In the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], the state is represented by seven members, six of whom are Republicans: ([[Jo Bonner]], [[Mike D. Rogers]], [[Robert Aderholt]], [[Morris J. Brooks]], [[Martha Roby]], and [[Spencer Bachus]]) and one Democrat: [[Terri Sewell]].

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Alabama}}

===Primary and secondary education===
[[File:Vestavia Hills High School.jpg|thumb|right|[[Vestavia Hills High School]] in the suburbs of Birmingham]]

Public primary and secondary education in Alabama is under the overview of the [[Alabama State Board of Education]] as well as local oversight by 67 county school boards and 60 city boards of education. Together, 1,541 individual schools provide education for 743,364 elementary and secondary students.&lt;ref name=&quot;qfacts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.alsde.edu/general/quick_facts.pdf |title= Alabama Education Quick Facts 2007 |accessdate =August 11, 2007 |format= PDF| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20070726181529/http://www.alsde.edu/general/quick_facts.pdf| archivedate= July 26, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public school funding is appropriated through the Alabama Legislature through the Education Trust Fund. In FY 2006–2007, Alabama appropriated $3,775,163,578 for primary and secondary education. That represented an increase of $444,736,387 over the previous fiscal year.&lt;ref name=&quot;qfacts&quot;/&gt; In 2007, over 82&amp;nbsp;percent of schools made adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward student proficiency under the National [[No Child Left Behind]] law, using measures determined by the state of Alabama. In 2004, 23 percent of schools met AYP.&lt;ref name=&quot;AYP&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.alsde.edu/Accountability/2007Reports/Press/2007AYPNewsRelease.pdf |title= Eighty-Two Percent of Alabama Schools Make AYP While Increasing Annual Measurable Objectives |accessdate =August 11, 2007 |format= PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Alabama's public education system has improved in recent decades, it lags behind in achievement compared to other states. According to U.S. Census data, Alabama's high school graduation rate—75%—is the fourth lowest in the U.S. (after Kentucky, Louisiana and Mississippi).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-24.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The largest educational gains were among people with some college education but without degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censusscope.org/us/s1/chart_education.html Education Statistics].

Major airports with sustained commercial operations in Alabama include [[Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport]] (BHM), [[Huntsville International Airport]] (HSV), [[Dothan Regional Airport]] (DHN), [[Mobile Regional Airport]] (MOB), [[Montgomery Regional Airport]] (MGM), and [[Northwest Alabama Regional Airport|Muscle Shoals – Northwest Alabama Regional Airport]] (MSL).

===Rail===
For rail transport, [[Amtrak]] schedules the Crescent, a daily passenger train, running from New York to New Orleans with stops at Anniston, Birmingham, and Tuscaloosa.

===Roads===
Alabama has five major interstate roads that cross the state: [[I-65]] runs north–south roughly through the middle of the state; I-59/I-20 travels from the central west border to Birmingham, where [[I-59]] continues to the north-east corner of the state and [[I-20]] continues east towards Atlanta; [[I-85]] originates in Montgomery and runs east-northeast to the Georgia border, providing a main thoroughfare to Atlanta; and [[Interstate 10 in Alabama|I-10]] traverses the southernmost portion of the state, running from west to east through Mobile. Another interstate road, [[Interstate 22|I-22]], is currently under construction. When completed around 2014 it will connect Birmingham with [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. In addition, there are currently five auxiliary interstate routes in the state: [[Interstate 165|I-165]] in Mobile, [[Interstate 359|I-359]] in Tuscaloosa, [[Interstate 459|I-459]] around Birmingham, [[Interstate 565|I-565]] in Huntsville, and [[Interstate 759|I-759]] in Gadsden. A sixth route, [[Interstate 685|I-685]], will be created when I-85 is rerouted along a new southern bypass of Montgomery. A proposed northern bypass of Birmingham will designated as [[Interstate 422|I-422]].

Several U.S. Highways also pass through the state, such as [[U.S. Route 11|US 11]], [[U.S. Route 29|US 29]], [[U.S. Route 31|US 31]], [[U.S. Route 43|US 43]], [[U.S. Route 45|US 45]], [[U.S. Route 72|US 72]], [[U.S. Route 78|US 78]], [[U.S. Route 80|US 80]], [[U.S. Route 82|US 82]], [[U.S. Route 84|US 84]], [[U.S. Route 90|US 90]], [[U.S. Route 98|US 98]], [[U.S. Route 231|US 231]], [[U.S. Route 278|US 278]], [[U.S. Route 280|US 280]], [[U.S. Route 331|US 331]], [[U.S. Route 411|US 411]], and [[U.S. Route 431|US 431]].

In April 2011, a study known as the American State Litter Scorecard ranked Alabama fifth (behind Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Nevada) among the &quot;Worst&quot; states for overall poor effectiveness and quality of its statewide public space cleanliness—primarily roadway and adjacent litter removals—from state and related efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spacek|first=Steve L.|title=The American State Litter Scorecard 2011: New Rankings for an Increasingly Environmentally Concerned Population|url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1006&amp;context=stevespacek|publisher=Selected Works|accessdate=July 22, 2013|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ports===
The [[Port of Mobile]], Alabama's only saltwater port, is a large seaport on the [[Gulf of Mexico]] with inland waterway access to the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] by way of the [[Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway]]. The Port of Mobile was ranked 12th by tons of traffic in the United States during 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;tonstraffic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Table 1086.

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Achilles''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|k|ɪ|l|iː|z}}; {{lang-grc|Ἀχιλλεύς}}, ''Akhilleus'', {{IPA-el|akʰillěws|pron}}) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] hero of the [[Trojan War]] and the central character and greatest warrior of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]''. Achilles was said to be a [[demigod]]; his mother was the nymph [[Thetis]], and his father, [[Peleus]], was the king of the [[Myrmidons]].

Achilles’ most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan hero [[Hector]] outside the gates of [[Troy]]. Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the ''Iliad'', other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], who shot him in the heel with an arrow. Later legends (beginning with a poem by [[Statius]] in the 1st century AD) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel. Because of his death from a small wound in the heel, the term ''[[Achilles' heel]]'' has come to mean a person's point of weakness.

== Etymology ==
Achilles' name can be analyzed as a combination of {{lang|grc|ἄχος}} (''akhos'') &quot;grief&quot; and {{lang|grc|λαός}} (''Laos'') &quot;a people, tribe, nation, etc.&quot; In other words, Achilles is an embodiment of the grief of the people, grief being a theme raised numerous times in the ''Iliad'' (frequently by Achilles). Achilles' role as the hero of grief forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of Achilles as the hero of ''kleos'' (glory, usually glory in war).

''Laos'' has been construed by [[Gregory Nagy]], following Leonard Palmer, to mean ''a corps of soldiers'', a [[muster (military)|muster]]. With this derivation, the name would have a double meaning in the poem: When the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring grief to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief of war. The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership.

The name Achilleus was a common and attested name among the Greeks soon after the 7th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/search?patt=*AXIL&amp;first=250 Epigraphical database] gives 476 matches for Ἀχιλ-.The earliest ones: [http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/oi?ikey=27810&amp;bookid=6&amp;region=2&amp;subregion=1 Corinth 7th c. BC],[http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/oi?ikey=238250&amp;bookid=118&amp;region=3&amp;subregion=7 Delphi 530 BC], Attica and Elis 5th c. BC.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also turned into the female form Ἀχιλλεία (''Achilleía'') attested in Attica in the 4th century BC ([[Inscriptiones Graecae|IG]] II² 1617) and, in the form ''Achillia'', on a [[Female gladiator#Halicarnassus|stele in Halicarnassus]] as the name of a female gladiator fighting an &quot;Amazon&quot;.

== Birth ==
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 181.jpg|thumb|''Thetis Dipping the Infant Achilles into the River Styx'' (ca. 1625), [[Peter Paul Rubens]]]]

Achilles was the son of the [[Nereid]] [[Thetis]] and [[Peleus]], the king of the [[Myrmidons]]. [[Zeus]] and [[Poseidon]] had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until [[Prometheus]], the fore-thinker, warned Zeus of a prophecy that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father. For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed Peleus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aeschylus]], ''Prometheus Bound'' 755–768; [[Pindar]], ''Nemean'' 5.34–37, ''Isthmian'' 8.26–47; ''[[Poeticon astronomicon]]'' (ii.15)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events: in ''[[Argonautica]]'' (iv.760) Zeus' sister and wife [[Hera]] alludes to Thetis' chaste resistance to the advances of Zeus, that Thetis was so loyal to Hera's marriage bond that she coolly rejected him. Thetis, although a daughter of the sea-god [[Nereus]], was also brought up by Hera, further explaining her resistance to the advances of Zeus.&lt;!--the following psychological interpretation has no counterpart in the myths:&quot;Zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal. So Hera recommended that she marry [[Peleus]], as he was as near to a mortal as she was ever going to get.&quot;--&gt;

[[File:The Education of Achilles, by James Barry.jpg|thumb|left|''The Education of Achilles'' (ca. 1772), by [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]]]]

According to the ''[[Achilleid]]'', written by [[Statius]] in the 1st century AD, and to no surviving previous sources, when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him immortal, by dipping him in the river [[Styx]]. However, he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him, his heel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Burgess| first = Jonathan S.| title = The Death and Afterlife of Achilles| url = http://books.google.com/?id=Ko_YAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA9| accessdate = 5 February 2010| year = 2009| publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press| location = Baltimore| isbn = 0-8018-9029-2| page = 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Achilles heel]], [[Achilles' tendon]]). It is not clear if this version of events was known earlier. In another version of this story, Thetis anointed the boy in [[ambrosia]] and put him on top of a fire, to burn away the mortal parts of his body. She was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Apollonius of Rhodes]], ''[[Argonautica]]'' 4.869–879.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, none of the sources before Statius makes any reference to this general invulnerability. To the contrary, in the ''Iliad'' Homer mentions Achilles being wounded: in Book 21 the [[Paeonian]] hero [[Asteropaeus]], son of Pelagon, challenged Achilles by the river Scamander. He cast two spears at once, one grazed Achilles' elbow, &quot;drawing a spurt of blood&quot;.

Also, in the fragmentary poems of the [[Epic Cycle]] in which we can find description of the hero's death, ''[[Cypria]]'' (unknown author), ''[[Aithiopis]]'' by [[Arctinus of Miletus]], ''[[Little Iliad]]'' by Lesche of Mytilene, ''[[Iliou persis]]'' by [[Arctinus of Miletus]], there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness (heel); in the later vase paintings presenting Achilles' death, the arrow (or in many cases, arrows) hit his body.

Peleus entrusted Achilles to [[Chiron]] the [[Centaur]], on Mt. [[Pelion]], to be reared.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''Catalogue of Women'', fr. 204.87–89 MW; ''Iliad'' 11.830-32&lt;/ref&gt;

== Achilles in the Trojan War ==
[[File:The Rage of Achilles by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo.jpeg|thumb|''The Rage of Achilles'', by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]]]]

The first two lines of the ''Iliad'' read:
:{{lang|grc|μῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ Πηληϊάδεω Ἀχιλῆος}}
:{{lang|grc|οὐλομένην, ἣ μυρί' Ἀχαιοῖς ἄλγε' ἔθηκεν,}}

:Sing, Goddess, of the rage of Peleus' son Achilles,
:the accursed rage that brought great suffering to the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]].

Achilles' consuming rage is at times wavering, but at other times he cannot be cooled. The humanization of Achilles by the events of the war is an important theme of the narrative.

According to the ''Iliad'', Achilles arrived at Troy with 50 ships, each carrying 50 [[Myrmidons]] (Book 2). He appointed five leaders (each leader commanding 500 Myrmidons): Menesthius, Eudorus, Peisander, Phoenix and Alcimedon (Book 16).

=== Telephus ===
When the Greeks left for the Trojan War, they accidentally stopped in [[Mysia]], ruled by King [[Telephus]]. In the resulting battle, Achilles gave Telephus a wound that would not heal; Telephus consulted an oracle, who stated that &quot;he that wounded shall heal&quot;. Guided by the oracle, he arrived at [[Argos]], where Achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to Troy. {{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

According to other reports in [[Euripides]]' lost play about Telephus, he went to [[Aulis (ancient Greece)|Aulis]] pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to heal his wound. Achilles refused, claiming to have no medical knowledge. Alternatively, Telephus held [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]] for ransom, the ransom being Achilles' aid in healing the wound. [[Odysseus]] reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound; therefore, the spear must be able to heal it.

=== Troilus ===
According to the ''[[Cypria]]'' (the part of the Epic Cycle that tells the events of the Trojan War before Achilles' Wrath), when the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] desired to return home, they were restrained by Achilles, who afterwards attacked the cattle of [[Aeneas]], sacked neighboring cities and killed [[Troilus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stoa.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Stoa:text:2003.01.0004 |title=Proclus' Summary of the Cypria |publisher=Stoa.org |date= |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his youth, he was one of the main Trojan war leaders. Prophecies linked Troilus' fate to that of Troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him. Yet Achilles, struck by the beauty of both Troilus and his sister [[Polyxena]], and overcome with lust, directed his sexual attentions on the youth&amp;nbsp;– who refusing to yield found instead himself decapitated upon an altar-omphalos of Apollo.

In this version of the myth, Achilles' death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege.&lt;ref&gt;James Davidson, [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n14/davi02_.html &quot;Zeus Be Nice Now&quot;] in ''London Review of Books;'' 19 July 2007, access date 23 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient writers treated Troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents. Had Troilus lived to adulthood, the [[First Vatican Mythographer]] claimed, Troy would have been invincible.

=== Achilles in the ''Iliad'' ===
{{main|Iliad}}
[[File:AmbrosianIliadPict47Achilles.jpg|thumb|Achilles sacrificing to [[Zeus]], from the [[Ambrosian Iliad]], a 5th-century illuminated manuscript]]

Homer's ''Iliad'' is the most famous narrative of Achilles' deeds in the Trojan War. Achilles' wrath is the central theme of the poem. The Homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the war, and does not narrate Achilles' death. It begins with Achilles' withdrawal from battle after he is dishonored by [[Agamemnon]], the commander of the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaean]] forces. Agamemnon had taken a woman named [[Chryseis]] as his slave. Her father [[Chryses]], a priest of [[Apollo]], begs Agamemnon to return her to him. Agamemnon refuses and Apollo sends a plague amongst the Greeks. The prophet [[Calchas]] correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless Achilles vows to protect him. Achilles does so and Calchas declares Chryseis must be returned to her father. Agamemnon consents, but then commands that Achilles' battle prize [[Briseis]] be brought to him to replace Chryseis. Angry at the dishonor of having his plunder and glory taken away (and as he says later, because he loved Briseis),&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' 9.334–343.&lt;/ref&gt; with the urging of his mother Thetis, Achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces. At this same time, burning with rage over Agamemnon's theft, Achilles prays to Thetis to convince Zeus to help the Trojans gain ground in the war, so that he may regain his honor.

As the battle turns against the Greeks, thanks to the influence of Zeus, [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] declares that the Trojans are winning because Agamemnon has angered Achilles, and urges the king to appease the warrior. Agamemnon agrees and sent [[Odysseus]] and two other chieftains, [[Ajax (mythology)|Ajax]] and [[Phoenix (son of Amyntor)|Phoenix]], to Achilles with the offer of the return of Briseis and other gifts. Achilles rejects all Agamemnon offers him, and simply urges the Greeks to sail home as he was planning to do.

The Trojans, led by [[Hector]], subsequently pushed the Greek army back toward the beaches and assaulted the Greek ships. With the Greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction, [[Patroclus]] leads the [[Myrmidons]] into battle wearing Achilles' armor, though Achilles remains at his camp. Patroclus succeeds in pushing the Trojans back from the beaches, but is killed by Hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of Troy.

[[File:Triumph of Achilles in Corfu Achilleion.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Triumphant Achilles dragging Hector's lifeless body in front of the Gates of [[Troy]] (from a [[panoramic]] [[fresco]] on the upper level of the main hall of the [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]]).]]

After receiving the news of the death of Patroclus from [[Antilochus]], the son of Nestor, Achilles grieves over his beloved companion's death and holds many funeral games in his honor. His mother Thetis comes to comfort the distraught Achilles. She persuades [[Hephaestus]] to make new armor for him, in place of the armor that Patroclus had been wearing which was taken by Hector. The new armor includes the [[Shield of Achilles]], described in great detail in the poem

Enraged over the death of Patroclus, Achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field killing many men in his rage but always seeking out Hector. Achilles even engages in battle with the river god [[Scamander]] who becomes angry that Achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed. The god tries to drown Achilles but is stopped by [[Hera]] and Hephaestus. Zeus himself takes note of Achilles' rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack Troy itself before the time alloted for its destruction, seeming to show that the unhindered rage of Achilles can defy fate itself. Finally, Achilles finds his prey. Achilles chases Hector around the wall of Troy three times before [[Athena]], in the form of Hector's favorite and dearest brother, [[Deiphobus]], persuades Hector to stop running and fight Achilles face to face. After Hector realizes the trick, he knows the battle is inevitable. Wanting to go down fighting, he charges at Achilles with his only weapon, his sword, but misses. Accepting his fate, Hector begs Achilles, not to spare his life, but to treat his body with respect after killing him. Achilles tells Hector it is hopeless to expect that of him, declaring that &quot;my rage, my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw – such agonies you have caused me&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Iliad&quot;, Fagles translation. Penguin Books, 1991, p. 553.&lt;/ref&gt; Achilles then kills Hector and drags his corpse behind his chariot during Patroclus' funeral games.

With the assistance of the god [[Hermes]], Hector's father, [[Priam]], goes to Achilles' tent to plead with Achilles for the return of Hector's body so that he can be buried. Achilles relents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral. The poem ends with a description of Hector's funeral, with the doom of Troy and Achilles himself still to come.

=== Penthesilea ===
Achilles, after his temporary truce with Priam, fought and killed the [[Amazons|Amazonian]] warrior queen [[Penthesilea]], but later grieved over her death. At first, he was so distracted by her beauty, he did not fight as intensely as usual. Once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life, he refocused and killed her. As he grieved over the death of such a rare beauty, a notorious Greek jeerer by the name of [[Thersites]] laughed and mocked the great Achilles.

=== Memnon, and the fall of Achilles ===
[[File:Achilles thniskon in Corfu.jpg|thumb|Achilles dying in the gardens of the [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]] in [[Corfu]]]]

Following the death of Patroclus, Achilles' closest companion was Nestor's son [[Antilochus]]. When [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]], king of [[Ethiopia (mythology)|Ethiopia]] slew Antilochus, Achilles once more obtained revenge on the battlefield, killing Memnon. The fight between Achilles and Memnon over Antilochus echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus, except that Memnon (unlike Hector) was also the son of a goddess.

Many Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the ''Iliad'''s description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles' reaction to it. The episode then formed the basis of the [[Epic Cycle|cyclic epic]] ''[[Aethiopis]]'', which was composed after the ''Iliad'', possibly in the 7th century B.C. The ''Aethiopis'' is now lost, except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors.

{{anchor|Fatalwound}}
The death of Achilles, as predicted by [[Hector]] with his dying breath, was brought about by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] with an arrow (to the heel according to Statius). In some versions, the god [[Apollo]] guided Paris' arrow. Some retellings also state that Achilles was scaling the gates of Troy and was hit with a poisoned arrow.

[[File:Aias body Akhilleus Staatliche Antikensammlungen 1884.jpg|thumb|Ajax carries off the body of Achilles: [[Attica|Attic]] black-figure ''[[lekythos]]'', ca. 510 BC, from Sicily ([[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]], Munich)]]
All of these versions deny Paris any sort of valor, owing to the common conception that Paris was a coward and not the man his brother Hector was, and Achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield. His bones were mingled with those of [[Patroclus]], and funeral games were held. He was represented in the ''Aethiopis'' as living after his death in the island of [[Leuke]] at the mouth of the river [[Danube]].

Another version of Achilles' death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the Trojan princesses, [[Polyxena]]. Achilles asks Priam for Polyxena's hand in marriage. Priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world's greatest warrior. But while Priam is overseeing the private marriage of Polyxena and Achilles, Paris, who would have to give up Helen if Achilles married his sister, hides in the bushes and shoots Achilles with a divine arrow, killing him.

Achilles was cremated and his ashes buried in the same urn as those of Patroclus.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton E. Mythology, New York: Penguin Books; 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

Paris was later killed by [[Philoctetes]] using the enormous bow of [[Heracles]].

=== Fate of Achilles' armor ===
Achilles' armor was the object of a feud between [[Odysseus]] and [[Ajax (mythology)|Telamonian Ajax]] (Ajax the greater). They competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after Achilles to their Trojan prisoners, who after considering both men came to a consensus in favor of Odysseus. Furious, Ajax cursed Odysseus, which earned the ire of Athena. Athena temporarily made Ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep, thinking them his comrades. After a while, when Athena lifted his madness and Ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep, Ajax was left so ashamed that he committed suicide. Odysseus eventually gave the armor to [[Neoptolemus]], the son of Achilles.

A relic claimed to be Achilles' bronze-headed spear was for centuries preserved in the temple of Athena on the acropolis of [[Phaselis]], Lycia, a port on the Pamphylian Gulf. The city was visited in 333 BC by [[Alexander the Great]], who envisioned himself as the new Achilles and carried the ''Iliad'' with him, but his court biographers do not mention the spear.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Alexander came to rest at Phaselis, a coastal city which was later renowned for the possession of Achilles' original spear.&quot; Robin Lane Fox, ''Alexander the Great'' 1973.144.&lt;/ref&gt; But it was being shown in the time of [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] in the 2nd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, iii.3.6; see Christian Jacob and Anne Mullen-Hohl, &quot;The Greek Traveler's Areas of Knowledge: Myths and Other Discourses in Pausanias' Description of Greece&quot;, ''Yale French Studies'' '''59''': Rethinking History: Time, Myth, and Writing (1980:65–85) esp. p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Achilles and Patroclus ==
{{main|Achilles and Patroclus}}

The exact nature of Achilles' relationship with Patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times. In the ''Iliad'', it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship, but commentators from [[classical antiquity]] to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures. In 5th-century BC Athens, the intense bond was often viewed in light of the [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|Greek custom of ''paiderasteia'']]. In Plato's ''Symposium'', the participants in a dialogue about love assume that Achilles and Patroclus were a couple; Phaedrus argues that Achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and Patroclus was the lover.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Sym.+180a 180a]; the beauty of Achilles was a topic already broached at ''Iliad'' 2.673–4.&lt;/ref&gt; But ancient Greek had no words to distinguish [[heterosexual]] and homosexual,&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth Dover]], ''Greek Homosexuality'' (Harvard University Press, 1978, 1989), p. 1 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women. Although epic decorum excluded explicit sexuality, the ''Iliad'' indicates that Achilles had sexual relations with women, with no direct evidence of sexual behaviors with Patroclus.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

== Worship of Achilles in antiquity ==
[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Briseis and Achilles.jpg|thumb|right|Achilles and Briseis]]

There was an archaic [[heroic cult]] of Achilles on the [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|White Island, ''Leuce'']], in the [[Black Sea]] off the modern coasts of [[Romania]] and [[Ukraine]], with a temple and an [[oracle]] which survived into the Roman period.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Hedreen, &quot;The Cult of Achilles in the Euxine&quot; ''Hesperia'' '''60'''.3 (July 1991), pp. 313–330.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lost epic '' [[Aithiopis]]'', a continuation of the ''Iliad'' attributed to [[Arctinus|Arktinus of Miletos]], Achilles’ mother Thetis returned to mourn him and removed his ashes from the pyre and took them to Leuce at the mouths of the Danube. There the Achaeans raised a [[tumulus]] for him and celebrated funeral games.

[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny's]] ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]''&lt;ref&gt;IV.27.1&lt;/ref&gt; mentions a tumulus that is no longer evident (''Insula Akchillis tumulo eius viri clara''), on the island consecrated to him, located at a distance of fifty Roman miles from [[Peuce]] by the [[Danube Delta]], and the temple there. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] has been told that the island is &quot;covered with forests and full of animals, some wild, some tame. In this island there is also Achilles’ temple and his statue&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;III.19.11&lt;/ref&gt; Ruins of a square temple 30 meters to a side, possibly that dedicated to Achilles, were discovered by Captain Kritzikly in 1823, but there has been no modern archeological work done on the island.

[[Pomponius Mela]] tells that Achilles is buried in the island named Achillea, between Boristhene and Ister.&lt;ref&gt;''De situ orbis'', II, 7&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek geographer Dionysius Periegetus of Bithynia, who lived at the time of Domitian, writes that the island was called ''Leuce'' &quot;because the wild animals which live there are white. It is said that there, in Leuce island, reside the souls of Achilles and other heroes, and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island; this is how Jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues, because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honor&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Orbis descriptio'', v. 541, quoted in Densuşianu 1913&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Periplus Ponti Euxini|Periplus of the Euxine Sea]]'' gives the following details: &quot;It is said that the goddess Thetis raised this island from the sea, for her son Achilles, who dwells there. Here is his temple and his statue, an archaic work. This island is not inhabited, and goats graze on it, not many, which the people who happen to arrive here with their ships, sacrifice to Achilles. In this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts, craters, rings and precious stones, offered to Achilles in gratitude. One can still read inscriptions in Greek and Latin, in which Achilles is praised and celebrated. Some of these are worded in Patroclus’ honor, because those who wish to be favored by Achilles, honor Patroclus at the same time. There are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds, which look after Achilles’ temple. Every morning they fly out to sea, wet their wings with water, and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it. And after they finish the sprinkling, they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings. Other people say still more, that some of the men who reach this island, come here intentionally. They bring animals in their ships, destined to be sacrificed. Some of these animals they slaughter, others they set free on the island, in Achilles’ honor. But there are others, who are forced to come to this island by sea storms. As they have no sacrificial animals, but wish to get them from the god of the island himself, they consult Achilles’ oracle. They ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island, and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair. But in case the oracle denies them permission, because there is an oracle here, they add something to the price offered, and if the oracle refuses again, they add something more, until at last, the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient. And then the victim doesn’t run away any more, but waits willingly to be caught. So, there is a great quantity of silver there, consecrated to the hero, as price for the sacrificial victims. To some of the people who come to this island, Achilles appears in dreams, to others he would appear even during their navigation, if they were not too far away, and would instruct them as to which part of the island they would better anchor their ships&quot;. (quoted in Densuşianu)

The heroic cult of Achilles on Leuce island was widespread in antiquity, not only along the sea lanes of the [[Black Sea|Pontic Sea]] but also in maritime cities whose economic interests were tightly connected to the riches of the Black Sea.

Achilles from Leuce island was venerated as ''Pontarches'' the lord and master of the Pontic Sea, the protector of sailors and navigation. Sailors went out of their way to offer sacrifice. To Achilles of Leuce were dedicated a number of important commercial port cities of the Greek waters: Achilleion in Messenia ([[Stephanus Byzantinus]]), Achilleios in Laconia ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], III.25,4) [[Nicolae Densuşianu]] (Densuşianu 1913) even though he recognized Achilles in the name of [[Aquileia]] and in the north arm of the Danube delta, the arm of Chilia (&quot;Achileii&quot;), though his conclusion, that Leuce had sovereign rights over Pontos, evokes modern rather than archaic sea-law.&quot;

Leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing. Pausanias (III.19,13) reports that the [[Delphi|Delphic Pythia]] sent a lord of Croton to be cured of a chest wound. [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] (XXII.8) attributes the healing to waters (''aquae'') on the island.

=== Worship of Achilles in modern times: The Achilleion in Corfu ===
In the region of Gastouri (Γαστούρι) to the south of the city of [[Corfu]] Greece, Empress of Austria [[Elisabeth of Bavaria]] also known as Sissi built in 1890 a summer palace with Achilles as its central theme and it is a monument to [[platonism|platonic]] [[romanticism]]. The palace, naturally, was named after Achilles: ''[[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]]'' (Αχίλλειον). This elegant structure abounds with paintings and statues of Achilles both in the main hall and in the lavish gardens depicting the heroic and tragic scenes of the [[Trojan war]].

== Other stories ==
[[File:Achilles in Corfu.jpg|thumb|left|Achilles as guardian of the palace in the gardens of the [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]] in Corfu. He gazes northward toward the city. The inscription in Greek reads: ΑΧΙΛΛΕΥΣ i.e. Achilles]]
{{main|Achilles on Skyros}}

Some post-Homeric sources claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war, Thetis (or, in some versions, Peleus) hides the young man at the court of [[Lycomedes]], king of [[Skyros]]. There, Achilles is disguised as a girl and lives among Lycomedes' daughters, perhaps under the name &quot;Pyrrha&quot; (the red-haired girl). With Lycomedes' daughter [[Deidamia (mythology)|Deidamia]], whom in the account of Statius he rapes, Achilles there fathers a son, [[Neoptolemus]] (also called Pyrrhus, after his father's possible alias). According to this story, Odysseus learns from the prophet [[Calchas]] that the Achaeans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles' aid. Odysseus goes to Skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women's clothes and jewelry and places a shield and spear among his goods. When Achilles instantly takes up the spear, Odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the Greek campaign. In another version of the story, Odysseus arranges for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes' women; while the women flee in panic, Achilles prepares to defend the court, thus giving his identity away.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philostratus III|Philostratus Junior]], ''Imagines'' i; Scholiast on Homer's Iliad, xix. 326; [[Ovid]], ''Metamorphoses'' 13.162ff., Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' iii. 13. 8, [[Statius]], [[Achilleid]], ii. 167ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In book 11 of Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', Odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades. One of these is Achilles, who when greeted as &quot;blessed in life, blessed in death&quot;, responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead. But Achilles then asks Odysseus of his son's exploits in the Trojan war, and when Odysseus tells of Neoptolemus' heroic actions, Achilles is filled with satisfaction. This leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how Achilles felt about the heroic life. Achilles was worshipped as a sea-god in many of the [[Greek colonies]] on the Black Sea, the location of the mythical &quot;White Island&quot; which he was said to inhabit after his death, together with many other heroes.

The kings of the [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] claimed to be descended from Achilles through his son, Neoptolemus. [[Alexander the Great]], son of the Epirote princess [[Olympias]], could therefore also claim this descent, and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor. He is said to have visited the tomb of Achilles at [[Achilleion (Troad)#Tomb of Achilles|Achilleion]] while passing Troy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arrian]], ''[[Anabasis Alexandri]]'' 1.12.1, [[Cicero]], ''Pro Archia Poeta'' 24.&lt;/ref&gt; In AD 216 the Roman Emperor [[Caracalla]], while on his way to war against [[Parthia]], emulated Alexander by holding games around Achilles' tumulus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dio Cassius]] 78.16.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Achilles fought and killed the [[Amazons|Amazon]] [[Helene (Amazon)|Helene]]. Some also said he married [[Medea]], and that after both their deaths they were united in the Elysian Fields of Hades&amp;nbsp;– as Hera promised Thetis in [[Apollonius of Rhodes|Apollonius]]' ''[[Argonautica]]''. In some versions of the myth, Achilles has a relationship with his captive [[Briseis]].

== Achilles in Greek tragedy ==
{{main|Achilleis (trilogy)}}

The [[tragedy|Greek tragedian]] [[Aeschylus]] wrote a trilogy of plays about Achilles, given the title ''Achilleis'' by modern scholars. The tragedies relate the deeds of Achilles during the Trojan War, including his defeat of [[Hector]] and eventual death when an arrow shot by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] and guided by [[Apollo]] punctures his heel. Extant fragments of the ''Achilleis'' and other Aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play. The first part of the ''Achilleis'' trilogy, ''The Myrmidons'', focused on the relationship between Achilles and chorus, who represent the Achaean army and try to convince Achilles to give up his quarrel with Agamemnon; only a few lines survive today.&lt;ref&gt;Pantelis Michelakis, ''Achilles in Greek Tragedy'', 2002, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; In Plato's ''Symposium'', Phaedrus points out that Aeschylus portrayed Achilles as the lover and Patroclus as the beloved; Phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because Achilles, being the younger and more beautiful of the two, was the beloved, who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to revenge him.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Symposium'', translated Benjamin Jowett, Dover Thrift Editions, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The tragedian [[Sophocles]] also wrote ''The Lovers of Achilles'', a play with Achilles as the main character. Only a few fragments survive.&lt;ref&gt;S. Radt. ''Tragicorum Graecorum fragmenta'', vol. 4, (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1977) frr. 149–157a.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Achilles in Greek philosophy ==
The philosopher [[Zeno of Elea]] centered one of [[Zeno's paradoxes|his paradoxes]] on an imaginary footrace between &quot;[[Epithets in Homer#Individuals|swift-footed]]&quot; [[Zeno's paradoxes#Achilles and the tortoise|Achilles and a tortoise]], by which he attempted to show that Achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start, and therefore that motion and change were impossible. As a student of the monist Parmenides and a member of the Eleatic school, Zeno believed time and motion to be illusions.

'''Abraham Lincoln''' {{IPAc-en|audio=Lincoln.ogg|ˈ|eɪ|b|r|ə|h|æ|m|_|ˈ|l|I|ŋ|k|ən}} (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was the [[List of Presidents of the United States|16th President of the United States]], serving from March 1861 until [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|his assassination in April 1865]]. Lincoln led the United States through its [[American Civil War|Civil War]]—its bloodiest war and its greatest moral, constitutional and political crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William A. Pencak|title=Encyclopedia of the Veteran in America|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yyvmcMsNnB4C&amp;pg=PA222|year=2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=222|isbn=978-0-313-08759-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Finkelman|author2=Stephen E. Gottlieb|title=Toward a Usable Past: Liberty Under State Constitutions|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xJuXT1sVhFcC&amp;pg=PA388|year=2009|publisher=U of Georgia Press|page=388|isbn=978-0-8203-3496-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In so doing he preserved the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], abolished slavery, strengthened the federal government and modernized the economy.

Reared in a poor family on the [[American frontier|western frontier]], Lincoln was a self-educated lawyer in [[Illinois]], a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party leader]], [[Illinois House of Representatives|state legislator]] during the 1830s, and a one-term member of the Congress during the 1840s.  He promoted rapid modernization of the economy through banks, canals, railroads and tariffs to encourage the building of factories; he opposed the war with Mexico in 1846.  After a [[Lincoln–Douglas debates|series of highly publicized debates]] in 1858 during which he opposed the expansion of slavery, Lincoln lost the U.S. Senate race to his archrival, Democrat [[Stephen A. Douglas]]. Lincoln, a moderate from a [[swing state]], secured the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] presidential nomination in 1860. With almost no support in the [[Southern United States|South]], Lincoln swept the [[Northern United States|North]] and was [[United States presidential election, 1860|elected president in 1860]]. His election prompted seven southern slave states to form the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. No compromise or reconciliation was found regarding slavery.

When the North enthusiastically rallied behind the national flag after the Confederate attack on [[Fort Sumter]] on April 12, 1861, Lincoln concentrated on the military and political dimensions of the war effort. His goal was to reunite the nation.  He suspended habeas corpus, arresting and temporarily detaining thousands of suspected secessionists in the border states without trial. Lincoln averted British intervention by defusing the Trent affair in late 1861. His numerous complex moves toward ending slavery centered on the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in 1863, using the Army to protect escaped slaves, encouraging the border states to outlaw slavery, and helping push through Congress the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which permanently outlawed slavery. Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, especially the selection of top generals, including commanding general [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. He made the major decisions on Union war strategy,  Lincoln's Navy set up a naval blockade that shut down the South's normal trade, helped take control of Kentucky and Tennessee, and gained control of the Southern river system using gunboats. He tried repeatedly to capture the Confederate capital at [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]. Each time a general failed, Lincoln substituted another until finally Grant succeeded in 1865.

An exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state, Lincoln reached out to &quot;[[War Democrats]]&quot; (who supported the North against the South), and managed his own re-election in the [[United States presidential election, 1864|1864 presidential election]]. As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican party, confronted Radical Republicans who demanded harsher treatment of the South, War Democrats who called for more compromise, Copperheads who despised him, and irreconcilable secessionists who plotted his death. Politically, Lincoln fought back with patronage, by pitting his opponents against each other, and by appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory.&lt;ref&gt;Randall (1947), pp. 65–87.&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Gettysburg Address]] of 1863 became an iconic statement of America's dedication to the principles of nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy. Lincoln held a moderate view of [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]], seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness. Six days after the surrender of Confederate commanding general [[Robert E. Lee]], Lincoln was assassinated by [[John Wilkes Booth]], a noted actor and Confederate sympathizer.

Lincoln has been consistently [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States#Scholar survey results|ranked]] both by scholars&lt;ref name=&quot;Ranking Our Presidents&quot;&gt;[http://history-world.org/pres.pdf &quot;Ranking Our Presidents&quot;].

==Family and childhood==

===Early life===
{{Main|Early life and career of Abraham Lincoln}}
Abraham Lincoln was born February 12, 1809, the second child of [[Thomas Lincoln]] and [[Nancy Lincoln]] (née Hanks), in a one-room log cabin on the [[Sinking Spring Farm]] in [[Hardin County, Kentucky|Hardin County]], Kentucky&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 20–22.&lt;/ref&gt; (now [[LaRue County, Kentucky|LaRue County]]). He is descended from [[Samuel Lincoln]], who arrived in [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]], Massachusetts, from [[Norfolk]], England, in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln's paternal grandfather and namesake, [[Abraham Lincoln (captain)|Abraham]], had moved his family from Virginia to Kentucky, where he was ambushed and killed in an [[Northwest Indian War|Indian raid]] in 1786, as his children, including Lincoln's father Thomas, looked on.&lt;ref name=&quot;white-12_13&quot;&gt;White, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas was left to make his own way on the frontier.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln's mother, Nancy, was the daughter of Lucy Hanks, and was born in what is now [[Mineral County, West Virginia|Mineral County]], West Virginia, then part of Virginia. Lucy moved with Nancy to Kentucky. Nancy Hanks married Thomas, who became a respected citizen. He bought or leased several farms, including [[Knob Creek Farm]]. The family attended a [[Separate Baptists]] church, which had restrictive moral standards and opposed alcohol, dancing, and slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 22–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas enjoyed considerable status in Kentucky—where he sat on juries, appraised estates, served on country slave patrols, and guarded prisoners. By the time his son Abraham was born, Thomas owned two {{convert|600|acre|ha|adj=on}} farms, several town lots, livestock, and horses. He was among the richest men in the county.  However, in 1816, Thomas lost all of his land in court cases because of faulty property titles.&lt;ref name=&quot;sandberg-20&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Young Lincoln By Charles Keck.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The young Lincoln in sculpture at Senn Park, Chicago|alt=A statue of young Lincoln sitting on a stump, holding a book open on his lap]]

The family [[Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial|moved north across the Ohio River]] to free (i.e., non-slave) territory and made a new start in what was then [[Perry County, Indiana#History|Perry County]] but is now [[Spencer County, Indiana]]. Lincoln later noted that this move was &quot;partly on account of slavery&quot; but mainly due to land title difficulties.&lt;ref name=&quot;sandberg-20&quot;&gt;Sandburg (1926), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In Indiana, when Lincoln was nine, his mother Nancy died of [[milk sickness]] in 1818.  After the death of Lincoln's mother, his older sister, [[Sarah Lincoln Grigsby|Sarah]], took charge of caring for him until their father remarried in 1819; Sarah later died in her 20s while giving birth to a stillborn son.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 20, 30-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Lincoln's new wife was the widow [[Sarah Bush Lincoln|Sarah Bush Johnston]], the mother of three children. Lincoln became very close to his stepmother, and referred to her as &quot;Mother&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; As a pre-teen, he did not like the hard labor associated with frontier life. Some in his family, and in the neighborhood, for a time considered him to be lazy.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 25, 31, 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; As he grew into his teens, he willingly took responsibility for all chores expected of him as one of the boys in the household and became an adept axeman in his work building rail fences. He attained a reputation for brawn and audacity after a very competitive wrestling match to which he was challenged by the renowned leader of a group of ruffians, &quot;the Clary's Grove boys&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln also agreed with the customary obligation of a son to give his father all earnings from work done outside the home until age 21.&lt;ref name=&quot;donald-1996-p30-33&quot;&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 30–33.&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, Lincoln occasionally loaned his father money.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 28, 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln became increasingly distant from his father, in part because of his father's lack of education. While young Lincoln's formal education consisted approximately of a year's worth of classes from several itinerant teachers, he was mostly self-educated and was an avid reader and often sought access to any new books in the village.  He read and reread the ''[[King James Bible]],'' [[Aesop]]'s ''Fables,'' [[John Bunyan|Bunyan]]'s ''Pilgrim's Progress,'' [[Daniel Defoe|Defoe]]'s ''Robinson Crusoe,'' and [[Benjamin Franklin|Franklin]]'s ''Autobiography.''&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp.&amp;nbsp;29–31, 38–43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Merrill D. Peterson|title=Lincoln in American Memory|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EADk9ZIMJXEC&amp;pg=PA110|year=1995|publisher=Oxford U.P.|page=110|isbn=978-0-19-988002-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1830, fearing a milk sickness outbreak along the Ohio River, the Lincoln family moved west, where they settled on public land 10 miles west of [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]], in [[Macon County, Illinois|Macon County]], Illinois, another free, non-slave state.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1831, Thomas relocated the family to a [[Lincoln Log Cabin State Historic Site|new homestead]] in [[Coles County, Illinois|Coles County]], Illinois. It was then that, as an ambitious 22-year-old who was now old enough to make his own decisions, Lincoln struck out on his own. Canoeing down the [[Sangamon River]], Lincoln ended up in the village of [[New Salem, Menard County, Illinois|New Salem]] in [[Sangamon County, Illinois|Sangamon County]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (2008), pp. 23–53&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1831, hired by a New Salem businessman [[Denton Offutt]] and accompanied by friends, he took goods by [[flatboat]] from New Salem to New Orleans via the Sangamon, Illinois, and Mississippi rivers. After arriving in New Orleans—and witnessing slavery firsthand—he walked back home.&lt;ref&gt;Sandburg (1926), pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's first romantic interest was [[Ann Rutledge]], whom he met when he first moved to New Salem; by 1835, they were in a relationship but not formally engaged. She died at the age of 22 on August 25, 1835, most likely of [[typhoid fever]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 55–58.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1830s, he met Mary Owens from Kentucky when she was visiting her sister. Late in 1836, Lincoln agreed to a match with Mary if she returned to New Salem. Mary did return in November 1836, and Lincoln courted her for a time; however, they both had second thoughts about their relationship. On August 16, 1837, Lincoln wrote Mary a letter suggesting he would not blame her if she ended the relationship. She never replied and the courtship ended.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 67–69; Thomas (2008), pp. 56–57, 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1840, Lincoln became engaged to [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Todd]], who was from a wealthy slave-holding family in [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]], Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; They met in [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]], Illinois, in December 1839&lt;ref name=&quot;Sandburg4648&quot;&gt;Sandburg (1926), pp. 46–48.&lt;/ref&gt; and were engaged the following December.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;
A wedding set for January 1, 1841, was canceled when the two broke off their engagement at Lincoln's initiative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sandburg4648&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; They later met again at a party and married on November 4, 1842, in the Springfield mansion of Mary's married sister.&lt;ref&gt;Sandburg (1926), pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt; While preparing for the nuptials and feeling anxiety again, Lincoln, when asked where he was going, replied, &quot;To hell, I suppose.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1844, the couple bought [[Lincoln Home National Historic Site|a house]] in Springfield near Lincoln's law office. Mary Todd Lincoln kept house, often with the help of a relative or hired servant girl.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Todd Lincoln]] was born in 1843 and [[Edward Baker Lincoln]] (Eddie) in 1846. Lincoln &quot;was remarkably fond of children&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Lincolns were not considered to be strict with their children.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Edward died on February 1, 1850, in Springfield, probably of tuberculosis. [[William Wallace Lincoln|&quot;Willie&quot; Lincoln]] was born on December 21, 1850, and died on February 20, 1862. The Lincolns' fourth son, [[Tad Lincoln|Thomas &quot;Tad&quot; Lincoln]], was born on April 4, 1853, and died of heart failure at the age of 18 on July 16, 1871.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 179–181, 476.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert was the only child to live to adulthood and have children. His last descendant, grandson [[Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith]], died in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jason Emerson|title=Giant in the Shadows: The Life of Robert T. Lincoln|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tPqgC3RS-7sC&amp;pg=PA420|year=2012|publisher=SIU Press|page=420|isbn=978-0-8093-3055-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deaths of their sons had profound effects on both parents. Later in life, Mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons, and Robert Lincoln committed her temporarily to a mental health asylum in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;Steers, p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham Lincoln suffered from &quot;[[Melancholia|melancholy]],&quot; a condition which now is referred to as [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlanticoct2005&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200510/lincolns-clinical-depression|title=Lincoln's Great Depression|first=Joshua Wolf|last=Shenk|date=October 2005|work=The Atlantic|publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Group|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62a4fProj |archivedate=2011-10-20|deadurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's father-in-law was based in Lexington, Kentucky; he and others of the Todd family were either slave owners or slave traders. Lincoln was close to the Todds, and he and his family occasionally visited the Todd estate in Lexington.&lt;ref&gt;Foner (1995), pp. 440–447.&lt;/ref&gt; He was an affectionate, though often absent, husband and father of four children.

==Early career and militia service==
{{Further|Early life and career of Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln in the Black Hawk War}}

In 1832, at age 23, Lincoln and a partner bought a small general store on credit in [[Lincoln's New Salem|New Salem]], Illinois. Although the economy was booming in the region, the business struggled and Lincoln eventually sold his share. That March he began his political career with his first campaign for the [[Illinois General Assembly]]. He had attained local popularity and could draw crowds as a natural [[raconteur]] in New Salem, though he lacked an education, powerful friends, and money, which may be why he lost. He advocated navigational improvements on the Sangamon River.&lt;ref&gt;Winkle ch 7–8.{{page needed|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the election, Lincoln served as a captain in the Illinois Militia during the [[Black Hawk War]].&lt;ref&gt;Winkle, pp. 86–95.&lt;/ref&gt; Following his return, Lincoln continued his campaign for the August 6 election for the Illinois General Assembly. At {{convert|6|ft|4|in|cm|0}},&lt;ref&gt;Sandburg (2002), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; he was tall and &quot;strong enough to intimidate any rival&quot;. At his first speech, when he saw a supporter in the crowd being attacked, Lincoln grabbed the assailant by his &quot;neck and the seat of his trousers&quot; and threw him.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates (the top four were elected), though he received 277 of the 300 votes cast in the New Salem precinct.&lt;ref&gt;Winkle, pp. 114–116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln served as New Salem's postmaster and later as county surveyor, all the while reading voraciously. He then decided to become a lawyer and began teaching himself law by reading [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' and other law books. Of his learning method, Lincoln stated: &quot;I studied with nobody&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 53–55.&lt;/ref&gt; His second campaign in 1834 was successful. He won election to the state legislature; though he ran as a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]], many Democrats favored him over a more powerful Whig opponent.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Admission to the bar in the United States|Admitted to the bar]] in 1836,&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; he moved to Springfield, Illinois, and began to practice law under [[John T. Stuart]], Mary Todd's cousin.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 71, 79, 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln became an able and successful lawyer with a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and closing arguments. He partnered with [[Stephen T. Logan]] from 1841 until 1844, when he began [[Lincoln-Herndon Law Offices State Historic Site|his practice]] with [[William Herndon (lawyer)|William Herndon]], whom Lincoln thought &quot;a studious young man&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1948), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; He served four successive terms in the [[Illinois House of Representatives]] as a Whig representative from Sangamon County.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1835–36 legislative session, he voted to expand suffrage to white males, whether landowners or not.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; He was known for his &quot;free soil&quot; stance of opposing both slavery and [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]]. He first articulated this in 1837, saying, &quot;[The] Institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy, but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; He closely followed [[Henry Clay]] in supporting the [[American Colonization Society]] program of making the abolition of slavery practical by helping the freed slaves to settle in [[Liberia]] in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Foner (2010), pp. 17–19, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Congressman Lincoln==
[[File:Abraham Lincoln by Nicholas Shepherd, 1846-crop.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Middle aged clean shaven Lincoln from the hips up.|Lincoln in his late 30s as a member of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]. Photo taken by one of Lincoln's law students around 1846.]]
From the early 1830s, Lincoln was a steadfast [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] and professed to friends in 1861 to be, &quot;an old line Whig, a disciple of Henry Clay&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; The party, including Lincoln, favored economic modernization in banking, protective tariffs to fund [[internal improvements]] including railroads, and espoused urbanization as well.&lt;ref&gt;Boritt (1994), pp. 137–153.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1846, Lincoln was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]], where he served one two-year term. He was the only Whig in the Illinois delegation, but he showed his party loyalty by participating in almost all votes and making speeches that echoed the party line.&lt;ref&gt;Oates, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln, in collaboration with abolitionist Congressman [[Joshua R. Giddings]], wrote a bill to abolish slavery in the [[Washington, District of Columbia|District of Columbia]] with compensation for the owners, enforcement to capture fugitive slaves, and a popular vote on the matter. He abandoned the bill when it failed to garner sufficient Whig supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p. 54; Foner (2010), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; On foreign and military policy, Lincoln spoke out against the [[Mexican–American War]], which he attributed to [[James K. Polk|President Polk]]'s desire for &quot;military glory—that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Heidler (2006), pp. 181–183.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln also supported the [[Wilmot Proviso]], which, if it had been adopted, would have banned slavery in any U.S. territory won from Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Holzer, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln emphasized his opposition to Polk by drafting and introducing his [[Spot Resolutions]]. The war had begun with a Mexican slaughter of American soldiers in territory disputed by Mexico and the U.S.; Polk insisted that Mexican soldiers had &quot;invaded ''our territory'' and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our ''own soil''{{-&quot;}}.&lt;ref&gt;Oates, pp. 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Basler1pp199—202&quot;&gt;Basler (1946), pp. 199–202.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln demanded that Polk show Congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on American soil.&lt;ref name=&quot;Basler1pp199—202&quot;/&gt; Congress never enacted the resolution or even debated it, the national papers ignored it, and it resulted in a loss of political support for Lincoln in his district. One Illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him &quot;spotty Lincoln&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGovern, p. 33&quot;&gt;McGovern, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Basler (1946), p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MuellerSchamel&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/lincoln-resolutions/|title=Lincoln's Spot Resolutions|publisher=National Archives|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62a5gtE9P|archivedate=2011-10-20|deadurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln later regretted some of his statements, especially his attack on the presidential war-making powers.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Realizing Clay was unlikely to win the presidency, Lincoln, who had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the House, supported General [[Zachary Taylor]] for the Whig nomination in the [[United States presidential election, 1848|1848 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 124–126.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor won and Lincoln hoped to be appointed Commissioner of the [[General Land Office]], but that lucrative patronage job went to an Illinois rival, [[Justin Butterfield]], considered by the administration to be a highly skilled lawyer, but in Lincoln's view, an &quot;old fossil&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; The administration offered him the consolation prize of secretary or governor of the [[Oregon Territory]]. This distant territory was a Democratic stronghold, and acceptance of the post would have effectively ended his legal and political career in Illinois, so he declined and resumed his law practice.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, pp. 55–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prairie lawyer==
Lincoln returned to practicing law in Springfield, handling &quot;every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Twice a year for 16 years, 10 weeks at a time, he appeared in county seats in the midstate region when the county courts were in session.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 105–106, 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln handled many transportation cases in the midst of the nation's western expansion, particularly the conflicts arising from the operation of river barges under the many new railroad bridges. As a riverboat man, Lincoln initially favored those interests, but ultimately represented whoever hired him.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 142–143.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, he later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in a [[Hurd v. Rock Island Bridge Company|landmark case]] involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2004/summer/bridge.html Bridging the Mississippi]. Archives.gov (2011-10-19). Retrieved on 2013-08-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 156–157.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1849, he received [[Abraham Lincoln's patent|a patent for a flotation device]] for the movement of boats in shallow water. The idea was never commercialized, but Lincoln is the only president to hold a patent.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object.cfm?key=35&amp;objkey=19|title=Abraham Lincoln's Patent Model: Improvement for Buoying Vessels Over Shoals|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62a7AMeAa|archivedate=2011-10-20|deadurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1851, he represented the [[Alton Railroad|Alton &amp; Sangamon Railroad]] in a dispute with one of its shareholders, James A. Barret, who had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to buy shares in the railroad on the grounds that the company had changed its original train route.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald p. 155&quot;&gt;Donald (1996), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dirck (2007), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln successfully argued that the railroad company was not bound by its original charter in existence at the time of Barret's pledge; the charter was amended in the public interest to provide a newer, superior, and less expensive route, and the corporation retained the right to demand Barret's payment. The decision by the [[Supreme Court of Illinois|Illinois Supreme Court]] has been cited by numerous other courts in the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald p. 155&quot;/&gt; Lincoln appeared before the Illinois Supreme Court in 175 cases, in 51 as sole counsel, of which 31 were decided in his favor.&lt;ref&gt;Handy, p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1853 to 1860, another of Lincoln's largest clients was the [[Illinois Central Railroad]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 155–156, 196–197.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's most notable criminal trial occurred in 1858 when he defended [[William &quot;Duff&quot; Armstrong]], who was on trial for the murder of James Preston Metzker.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald150151&quot;&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 150–151.&lt;/ref&gt; The case is famous for Lincoln's use of a fact established by [[judicial notice]] in order to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness. After an opposing witness testified seeing the crime in the moonlight, Lincoln produced a ''[[Farmers' Almanac]]'' showing the moon was at a low angle, drastically reducing visibility. Based on this evidence, Armstrong was acquitted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald150151&quot;/&gt; Lincoln rarely raised objections in the courtroom; but in an 1859 case, where he defended a cousin, Peachy Harrison, who was accused of stabbing another to death, Lincoln angrily protested the judge's decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client. Instead of holding Lincoln in contempt of court as was expected, the judge, a Democrat, reversed his ruling, allowing the evidence and acquitting Harrison.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald150151&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harrison (1935), p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Republican politics 1854–60==

===Slavery and a &quot;House Divided&quot;===
{{further|Slave and free states|Abraham Lincoln and slavery}}
By the 1850s, slavery was still legal in the southern United States, but had been generally outlawed in the northern states, such as Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Peculiar Instution|url=http://publications.newberry.org/lincoln/exhibits/show/alwayshatedslavery/peculiarinstitution|publisher=Newberry Library and Chicago History Museum|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62dB0ccYV|archivedate=2011-10-22|accessdate=2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln disapproved of slavery, and the spread of slavery to new U.S. territory in the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lincoln Speaks Out|url=http://publications.newberry.org/lincoln/exhibits/show/alwayshatedslavery/speaksout|publisher=Newberry Library and Chicago History Museum|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62dBlWFGi|archivedate=2011-10-22|accessdate=2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to politics to oppose the pro-slavery [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]] (1854); this law repealed the slavery-restricting [[Missouri Compromise]] (1820). Senior Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] of Illinois had incorporated [[Popular sovereignty in the United States#Emergence of the term &quot;popular sovereignty&quot; and its pejorative connotation|popular sovereignty]] into the Act. Douglas' provision, which Lincoln opposed, specified settlers had the right to determine locally whether to allow slavery in new U.S. territory, rather than have such a decision restricted by the national Congress.&lt;ref&gt;McGovern, pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Foner]] (2010) contrasts the abolitionists and anti-slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast who saw slavery as a sin, with the conservative Republicans who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress. Foner argues that Lincoln was a moderate in the middle, opposing slavery primarily because it violated the [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism principles]] of the [[Founding Fathers]], especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;Foner (2010), pp. 84–88.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:DredScott.jpg|alt=Painting|thumb|upright|Portrait of [[Dred Scott]]. Lincoln denounced the Supreme Court decision in ''Dred Scott v. Sandford'' as part of a conspiracy to extend slavery.]]

On October 16, 1854, in his &quot;[[Abraham Lincoln Peoria speech|Peoria Speech]]&quot;, Lincoln declared his opposition to slavery, which he repeated en route to the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (2008), pp. 148–152.&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking in his Kentucky accent, with a very powerful voice,&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; he said the Kansas Act had a &quot;''declared'' indifference, but as I must think, a covert ''real'' zeal for the spread of slavery. I cannot but hate it. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world&amp;nbsp;...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Basler (1953), p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1854, Lincoln ran as a Whig for the U.S. Senate seat from Illinois. At that time, senators were elected by the state legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Oates, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; After leading in the first six rounds of voting in the Illinois assembly, his support began to dwindle, and Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for [[Lyman Trumbull]], who defeated opponent [[Joel Aldrich Matteson]].&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 205–208.&lt;/ref&gt; The Whigs had been irreparably split by the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Lincoln wrote, &quot;I think I am a Whig, but others say there are no Whigs, and that I am an abolitionist, even though I do no more than oppose the ''extension'' of slavery.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=wecyqmIs6voC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=I+think+I+am+a+Whig,+but+others+say+there+are+no+Whigs,+and+that+I+am+an+abolitionist,+even+though+I+do+no+more+than+oppose+the+extension+of+slavery.#v=onepage&amp;q=I%20think%20I%20am%20a%20Whig%2C%20but%20others%20say%20there%20are%20no%20Whigs%2C%20and%20that%20I%20am%20an%20abolitionist%2C%20even%20though%20I%20do%20no%20more%20than%20oppose%20the%20extension%20of%20slavery.&amp;f=false |title=Lincoln Looks West: From the Mississippi to the Pacific|first1= Richard W.|last1= Etulain|author2=Robert W.

In 1857–1858, Douglas broke with President [[James Buchanan]], leading to a fight for control of the Democratic Party. Some eastern Republicans even favored the reelection of Douglas for the Senate in 1858, since he had led the opposition to the [[Lecompton Constitution]], which would have admitted Kansas as a [[slave state]].&lt;ref&gt;Oates, pp. 138–139.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1857, the Supreme Court issued its decision in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]''; Chief Justice [[Roger B. Taney]] opined that blacks were not citizens, and derived no rights from the Constitution. Lincoln denounced the decision, alleging it was the product of a conspiracy of Democrats to support the [[Slave Power]].&lt;ref&gt;Zarefsky, pp. 69–110.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln argued, &quot;The authors of the Declaration of Independence never intended 'to say all were equal in color, size, intellect, moral developments, or social capacity', but they 'did consider all men created equal—equal in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jaffa, pp. 299–300.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the state Republican party convention nominated him for the U.S. Senate in 1858, Lincoln delivered his [[Lincoln's House Divided Speech|House Divided Speech]], drawing on {{bible|Mark 3:25}}: &quot;A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the house to fall—but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate, and rallied Republicans across the North.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the Illinois legislature which would, in turn, select Lincoln or Douglas as its U.S. senator.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lincoln–Douglas debates and Cooper Union speech===
[[File:Abraham Lincoln by Byers, 1858 - crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Lincoln in 1858, the year of his debates with Stephen Douglas.]]

The Senate campaign featured the seven [[Lincoln–Douglas debates]] of 1858, the most famous political debates in American history.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson (1993), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. Lincoln warned that &quot;[[The Slave Power]]&quot; was threatening the values of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]], and accused Douglas of distorting the values of the Founding Fathers that [[all men are created equal]], while Douglas emphasized his [[Freeport Doctrine]], that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not, and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 214–224.&lt;/ref&gt; The debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands. Lincoln stated Douglas' [[popular sovereignty]] theory was a threat to the nation's morality and that Douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states. Douglas said that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court and the ''Dred Scott'' decision.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected Douglas to the Senate. Despite the bitterness of the defeat for Lincoln, his articulation of the issues gave him a national political reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Carwardine (2003), pp. 89–90.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1859, Lincoln purchased the ''Illinois Staats-Anzeiger,'' a German-language newspaper which was consistently supportive; most of the state's 130,000 German Americans voted Democratic but there was Republican support that a German-language paper could mobilize.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 242, 412.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 27, 1860, New York party leaders invited Lincoln to give a [[Cooper Union speech|speech at Cooper Union]] to a group of powerful Republicans. Lincoln argued that the Founding Fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery. Lincoln insisted the moral foundation of the Republicans required opposition to slavery, and rejected any &quot;groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffa, p. 473.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his inelegant appearance—many in the audience thought him awkward and even ugly&lt;ref&gt;Holzer, pp. 108–111.&lt;/ref&gt;—Lincoln demonstrated an intellectual leadership that brought him into the front ranks of the party and into contention for the Republican presidential nomination. Journalist [[Noah Brooks]] reported, &quot;No man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a New York audience.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Carwardine (2003), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holzer, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[David Herbert Donald|Donald]] described the speech as a &quot;superb political move for an unannounced candidate, to appear in one rival's ([[William H. Seward]]) own state at an event sponsored by the second rival's ([[Salmon P. Chase]]) loyalists, while not mentioning either by name during its delivery&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to an inquiry about his presidential intentions, Lincoln said, &quot;The taste ''is'' in my mouth a little.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1860 Presidential nomination and campaign===

On May 9–10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln's followers organized a campaign team led by [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]], [[Norman B. Judd|Norman Judd]], [[Leonard Swett]], and Jesse DuBois, and Lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Oates, pp. 175–176.&lt;/ref&gt; Exploiting the embellished legend of his frontier days with his father (clearing the land and splitting fence rails with an ax), Lincoln's supporters adopted the label of &quot;The Rail Candidate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 18, at the [[1860 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] in Chicago, Lincoln's friends promised and manipulated and won the nomination on the third ballot, beating candidates such as William H. Seward and Salmon P. Chase. A former Democrat, [[Hannibal Hamlin]] of Maine, was nominated for Vice President to balance the ticket. Lincoln's success depended on his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue, and his strong support for Whiggish programs of internal improvements and the protective tariff.&lt;ref&gt;Luthin, pp. 609–629.&lt;/ref&gt; On the third ballot Pennsylvania put him over the top. Pennsylvania iron interests were reassured by his support for protective tariffs.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstadter, pp. 50–55.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln's managers had been adroitly focused on this delegation as well as the others, while following Lincoln's strong dictate to &quot;Make no contracts that bind me&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 247–250.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party, as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government with the ''Dred Scott'' decision and the presidency of James Buchanan. Throughout the 1850s, Lincoln doubted the prospects of civil war, and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession.&lt;ref&gt;Boritt (1994), pp. 10, 13, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats. Delegates from 11 slave states walked out of the [[1860 Democratic National Convention|Democratic convention]], disagreeing with Douglas' position on popular sovereignty, and ultimately selected [[John C. Breckinridge]] as their candidate.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Douglas and the other candidates went through with their campaigns, Lincoln was the only one of them who gave no speeches. Instead, he monitored the campaign closely and relied on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party. The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North, and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and newspaper editorials. There were thousands of Republican speakers who focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty. The goal was to demonstrate the superior power of &quot;free labor&quot;, whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 254–256.&lt;/ref&gt; The Republican Party's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a ''Chicago Tribune'' writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln's life, and sold 100,000 to 200,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected the 16th president of the United States, beating Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, John C. Breckinridge of the Southern Democrats, and [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] of the new [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]]. He was the first president from the Republican Party. His victory was entirely due to the strength of his support in the North and West; no ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states, and he won only two of 996 counties in all the Southern states.&lt;ref&gt;Mansch, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln received 1,866,452 votes, Douglas 1,376,957 votes, Breckinridge 849,781 votes, and Bell 588,789 votes. Turnout was 82.2&amp;nbsp;percent, with Lincoln winning the free Northern states, as well as California and Oregon. Douglas won Missouri, and split New Jersey with Lincoln.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell won Virginia, Tennessee, and Kentucky, and Breckinridge won the rest of the South.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Lincoln won only a plurality of the popular vote, his victory in the [[United States Electoral College|electoral college]] was decisive: Lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123. There were [[Electoral fusion|fusion tickets]] in which all of Lincoln's opponents combined to support the same slate of Electors in New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, but even if the anti-Lincoln vote had been combined in every state, Lincoln still would have won a majority in the Electoral College.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, ''Ordeal of the Union'' vol 4. p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Lincoln's election became evident, secessionists made clear their intent to leave the Union before he took office the next March.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar, p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 20, 1860, South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession; by February 1, 1861, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald, p. 267&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potter, p. 498.&lt;/ref&gt; Six of these states then adopted a constitution and declared themselves to be a sovereign nation, the [[Confederate States of America]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald, p. 267&quot;&gt;Donald (1996), p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; The upper South and border states (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) listened to, but initially rejected, the secessionist appeal.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy, declaring secession illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, pp. 520, 569–570.&lt;/ref&gt; The Confederacy selected [[Jefferson Davis]] as its provisional President on February 9, 1861.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were attempts at compromise. The [[Crittenden Compromise]] would have extended the [[Missouri Compromise]] line of 1820, dividing the territories into slave and free, contrary to the Republican Party's free-soil platform.&lt;ref name=White360-361&gt;White, pp. 360–361.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln rejected the idea, saying, &quot;I will suffer death before I consent&amp;nbsp;... to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln, however, did tacitly support the proposed [[Corwin Amendment]] to the Constitution, which passed Congress before Lincoln came into office and was then awaiting ratification by the states. That proposed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed and would have guaranteed that Congress would not interfere with slavery without Southern consent.&lt;ref&gt;Vorenberg, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vile_pp280&gt;Vile (2003), ''Encyclopedia of Constitutional Amendments: Proposed Amendments, and Amending Issues 1789–2002'' pp.&amp;nbsp;280–281&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks before the war, Lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them Congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the Constitution.&lt;ref name=Lupton_2006&gt;Lupton (2006), [http://www.lib.niu.edu/2006/ih060934.html Abraham Lincoln and the Corwin Amendment], Retrieved 2013-01-13&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln was open to the possibility of a constitutional convention to make further amendments to the Constitution.&lt;ref name=Vile_p281&gt;Vile (2003), ''Encyclopedia of Constitutional Amendments: Proposed Amendments, and Amending Issues 1789–2002'' p.&amp;nbsp;281&lt;/ref&gt;

En route to his inauguration by train, Lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the North.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 273–277.&lt;/ref&gt; The president-elect then [[Baltimore Plot|evaded possible assassins]] in Baltimore, who were uncovered by Lincoln's head of security, [[Allan Pinkerton]]. On February 23, 1861, he arrived in disguise in Washington, D.C., which was placed under substantial military guard.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 277–279.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln directed his [[Lincoln's first inaugural address|inaugural address]] to the South, proclaiming once again that he had no intention, or inclination, to abolish slavery in the Southern states:
{{quote|Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States that by the accession of a Republican Administration their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered. There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension. Indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection. It is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you. I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that &quot;I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.&quot;|[[Lincoln's first inaugural address|First inaugural address]], 4 March 1861&lt;ref&gt;Sandburg (2002), p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The President ended his address with an appeal to the people of the South: &quot;We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies&amp;nbsp;... The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 283–284.&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of the [[Peace Conference of 1861]] signaled that legislative compromise was impossible. By March 1861, no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. Meanwhile, Lincoln and the Republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the Union could not be tolerated.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 268, 279.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lincoln said as the war was ending:
:Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the Nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came.&lt;ref&gt;March 4, 1865, [[Lincoln's second inaugural address]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beginning of the war===
{{Main|American Civil War|Battle of Fort Sumter}}
[[File:Major Robert Anderson.jpg|alt=portrait|thumb|upright|[[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Major Anderson]], Ft. Sumter commander]]

The commander of Fort Sumter, South Carolina, [[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Major Robert Anderson]], sent a request for provisions to Washington, and the execution of Lincoln's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war. On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union troops at [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]], forcing them to surrender, and began the war. Historian [[Allan Nevins]] argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis, exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South, and not realizing the Southern Unionists were insisting there be no invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Nevins, Ordeal of the Union'' (1959) vol 5 p 29&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] talked to Lincoln during inauguration week and was &quot;sadly disappointed&quot; at his failure to realize that &quot;the country was sleeping on a volcano&quot; and that the South was preparing for war.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, pp. 185–186.&lt;/ref&gt; Donald concludes that, &quot;His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on Ft. Sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood. But he also vowed not to surrender the forts. The only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot; they did just that.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 15, Lincoln called on all the states to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect Washington, and &quot;preserve the Union&quot;, which, in his view, still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. This call forced the states to choose sides. Virginia declared its secession and was rewarded with the Confederate capital, despite the exposed position of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] so close to Union lines. North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas also voted for secession over the next two months. Secession sentiment was strong in Missouri and Maryland, but did not prevail; Kentucky tried to be neutral.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oates, p. 226&quot;&gt;Oates, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

Troops headed south towards Washington to protect the capital in response to Lincoln's call. On April 19, secessionist mobs in Baltimore that controlled the rail links [[Baltimore riot of 1861|attacked Union troops]] traveling to the capital. [[George William Brown]], the Mayor of Baltimore, and other suspected Maryland politicians were arrested and imprisoned, without a warrant, as Lincoln suspended the writ of ''[[Habeas corpus in the United States#Suspension during the Civil War|habeas corpus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Heidler (2000), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Merryman]], a leader in the secessionist group in Maryland, petitioned Chief Justice [[Roger B. Taney]] to issue a writ of ''habeas corpus,'' saying holding Merryman without a hearing was unlawful. Taney issued the writ, thereby ordering Merryman's release, but Lincoln ignored it. Then and throughout the war, Lincoln came under heavy attack from antiwar Democrats, called [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott, pp. 326–341.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assuming command for the Union in the war===
After the fall of [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]], Lincoln realized the importance of taking immediate executive control of the war and making an overall strategy to put down the rebellion. Lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis, and he responded as [[commander-in-chief]], using unprecedented powers. He expanded his war powers, and imposed a blockade on all the Confederate shipping ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, and after suspending ''habeas corpus'', arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers. Lincoln was supported by Congress and the northern public for these actions. In addition, Lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong Union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 303–304; Carwardine (2003), pp. 163–164.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RunningtheMachine-LincAdmin.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A group of men sitting at a table as another man creates money on a wooden machine.|&quot;Running the 'Machine'&amp;nbsp;&quot;: An 1864 political cartoon takes a swing at Lincoln's administration—featuring [[William Fessenden]], [[Edwin Stanton]], [[William H. Seward|William Seward]], [[Gideon Welles]], Lincoln and others.]]
The war effort was the source of continued disparagement of Lincoln, and dominated his time and attention. From the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort, and any manner of compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 315, 331–333, 338–339, 417.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the [[Confiscation Act of 1861|Confiscation Act]] that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort. In practice the law had little effect, but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 314; Carwardine (2003), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late August 1861, General [[John C. Frémont]], the 1856 Republican presidential nominee, issued, without consulting his superiors in Washington, a proclamation of [[martial law]] in Missouri. He declared that any citizen found bearing arms could be [[court-martial]]ed and shot, and that slaves of persons aiding the rebellion would be freed. Frémont was already under a cloud with charges of negligence in his command of the [[Department of the West]] compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption. Lincoln overruled Frémont's proclamation. Lincoln believed that Fremont's emancipation was political; neither militarily necessary nor legal.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 314–317.&lt;/ref&gt; After Lincoln acted, Union enlistments from Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri increased by over 40,000 troops.&lt;ref&gt;Carwardine (2003), p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Trent Affair]] of late 1861 threatened war with Great Britain. The U.S. Navy illegally intercepted a British merchant ship, the ''Trent'', on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys; Britain protested vehemently while the U.S. cheered. Lincoln resolved the issue by releasing the two men and war was successfully averted with Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;CFAdams&quot;&gt;Adams, pp. 540–562.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln's foreign policy approach had been initially hands off, due to his inexperience; he left most diplomacy appointments and other foreign policy matters to his Secretary of State, William Seward. Seward's initial reaction to the ''Trent'' affair, however, was too bellicose, so Lincoln also turned to Senator [[Charles Sumner]], the chairman of the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] and an expert in British diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

To learn technical military terms, Lincoln borrowed and studied [[Henry Halleck]]'s book, ''Elements of Military Art and Science'' from the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Prokopowicz, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraphic reports coming into the [[United States War Department|War Department]] in Washington, D.C. He kept close tabs on all phases of the military effort, consulted with governors, and selected generals based on their past success (as well as their state and party). In January 1862, after many complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the War Department, Lincoln replaced [[Simon Cameron]] with [[Edwin Stanton]] as [[United States Secretary of War|War Secretary]]. Stanton was one of many conservative Democrats (he supported Breckenridge in the 1860 election) who became anti-slavery Republicans under Lincoln's leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin P. Thomas and Harold M. Hyman, ''Stanton, the Life and Times of Lincoln's Secretary of War'' (Knopf, 1962){{Page needed|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of war strategy, Lincoln articulated two priorities: to ensure that Washington was well-defended, and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the North for prompt, decisive victory; major Northern newspaper editors expected victory within 90 days.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 295–296.&lt;/ref&gt; Twice a week, Lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon, and occasionally Mary Lincoln would force him to take a carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 391–392.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln learned from his chief of staff General [[Henry Wager Halleck|Henry Halleck]], a student of the European strategist [[Antoine-Henri Jomini|Jomini]], of the critical need to control strategic points, such as the Mississippi River;&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, pp. 7, 66, 159.&lt;/ref&gt; he also knew well the importance of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]] and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing territory.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 432–436.&lt;/ref&gt;

===General McClellan===
After the Union defeat at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] and the retirement of the aged [[Winfield Scott]] in late 1861, Lincoln appointed Major General [[George B. McClellan]] general-in-chief of all the Union armies.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 318–319.&lt;/ref&gt; McClellan, a young West Point graduate, railroad executive, and Pennsylvania Democrat, took several months to plan and attempt his [[Peninsula Campaign]], longer than Lincoln wanted. The campaign's objective was to capture Richmond by moving the [[Army of the Potomac]] by boat to the peninsula and then overland to the Confederate capital. McClellan's repeated delays frustrated Lincoln and Congress, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops in defense of the capital; McClellan, who consistently overestimated the strength of Confederate troops, blamed this decision for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 349–352.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lincoln and McClellan 1862-10-03.jpg|alt=Photograph of Lincoln and McClellan sitting at a table in a field tent|thumb|Lincoln and McClellan after the Battle of Antietam]]

Lincoln removed McClellan as general-in-chief and appointed [[Henry Wager Halleck]] in March 1862, after McClellan's &quot;Harrison's Landing Letter&quot;, in which he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 360–361.&lt;/ref&gt; McClellan's letter incensed Radical Republicans, who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]], a Republican, as head of the new [[Army of Virginia]]. Pope complied with Lincoln's strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north, thus protecting the capital from attack. However, lacking requested reinforcements from McClellan, now commanding the Army of the Potomac, Pope was soundly defeated at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]] in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins (1960), pp. 2:159–162.&lt;/ref&gt; The war also expanded with naval operations in 1862 when the [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']], formerly the USS ''Merrimack'', damaged or destroyed three Union vessels in Norfolk, Virginia, before being engaged and damaged by the [[USS Monitor|USS ''Monitor'']]. Lincoln closely reviewed the dispatches and interrogated naval officers during their clash in the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 339–340.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his dissatisfaction with McClellan's failure to reinforce Pope, Lincoln was desperate, and restored him to command of all forces around Washington, to the dismay of all in his cabinet but Seward.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, pp. 478–479.&lt;/ref&gt; Two days after McClellan's return to command, General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s forces crossed the [[Potomac River]] into Maryland, leading to the [[Battle of Antietam]] in September 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, pp. 478–480.&lt;/ref&gt; The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American history, but it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in January. Having composed the Proclamation some time earlier, Lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, p. 481.&lt;/ref&gt; McClellan then resisted the President's demand that he pursue Lee's retreating and exposed army, while his counterpart General [[Don Carlos Buell]] likewise refused orders to move the [[Army of the Ohio]] against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee. As a result, Lincoln replaced Buell with [[William Rosecrans]]; and, after the 1862 midterm elections, he replaced McClellan with Republican [[Ambrose Burnside]]. Both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the Commander-in-Chief.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 389–390.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Union soldiers entrenched along the west bank of the Rappahannock River at Fredericksburg, Virginia (111-B-157).jpg|thumb|left|Union soldiers before Marye's Heights, [[Second Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]], just prior to the battle of May 3, 1863]]
Burnside, against the advice of the president, prematurely launched an offensive across the [[Rappahannock River]] and was stunningly defeated by Lee at [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]] in December. Not only had Burnside been defeated on the battlefield, but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined. Desertions during 1863 were in the thousands and they increased after Fredericksburg.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 429–431.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln brought in [[Joseph Hooker]], despite his record of loose talk about the need for a military dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins 6:433-44&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1862|mid-term elections]] in 1862 brought the Republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor with the administration over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war, as well as rising inflation, new high taxes, rumors of corruption, the suspension of ''habeas corpus,'' [[Conscription|the military draft law]], and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market. The Emancipation Proclamation announced in September gained votes for the Republicans in the rural areas of New England and the upper Midwest, but it lost votes in the cities and the lower Midwest. While Republicans were discouraged, Democrats were energized and did especially well in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and New York. The Republicans did maintain their majorities in Congress and in the major states, except New York. The Cincinnati ''Gazette'' contended that the voters were &quot;depressed by the interminable nature of this war, as so far conducted, and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins vol 6 pp. 318–322, quote on p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1863, Lincoln was optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together; these plans included Hooker's attack on Lee north of Richmond, Rosecrans' on Chattanooga, Grant's on Vicksburg, and a naval assault on Charleston.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 422–423.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooker was routed by Lee at the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in May,&lt;ref&gt;Nevins 6:432–450.&lt;/ref&gt; but continued to command his troops for some weeks. He ignored Lincoln's order to divide his troops, and possibly force Lee to do the same in [[Harper's Ferry]], and tendered his resignation, which Lincoln accepted. He was replaced by [[George Meade]], who followed Lee into Pennsylvania for the [[Gettysburg Campaign]], which was a victory for the Union, though Lee's army avoided capture. At the same time, after initial setbacks, Grant laid siege to Vicksburg and the Union navy attained some success in Charleston harbor.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 444–447.&lt;/ref&gt;
After the Battle of Gettysburg, Lincoln clearly understood that his military decisions would be more effectively carried out by conveying his orders through his War Secretary or his general-in-chief on to his generals, who resented his civilian interference with their own plans. Even so, he often continued to give detailed directions to his generals as Commander-in-Chief.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emancipation Proclamation===
{{Main|Abraham Lincoln and slavery|Emancipation Proclamation}}

[[File:Emancipation proclamation.jpg|thumb|left|Lincoln presents the first draft of the Emancipation Proclamation to his cabinet. Painted by [[Francis Bicknell Carpenter]] in 1864|alt=A dark-haired, bearded, middle-aged man holding documents is seated among seven other men.]]

Lincoln understood that the Federal government's power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution, which before 1865, committed the issue to individual states. He argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new U.S. territory. At the beginning of the war, he also sought to persuade the states to accept [[compensated emancipation]] in return for their prohibition of slavery. Lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in these ways would economically expunge it, as envisioned by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]], under the constitution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackubin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/books/owens200403251139.asp|title=The Liberator|first=Thomas Owens|last=Mackubin|date=March 25, 2004|work=National Review|publisher=National Review|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62a7fJ9hj|archivedate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Lincoln rejected two geographically limited emancipation attempts by Major General [[John C. Frémont]] in August 1861 and by Major General [[David Hunter]] in May 1862, on the grounds that it was not within their power, and it would upset the border states loyal to the Union.&lt;ref&gt;Guelzo (1999), pp. 290–291.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 19, 1862, endorsed by Lincoln, Congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory. In July 1862, the Second [[Confiscation Acts|Confiscation Act]] was passed, which set up court procedures that could free the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion. Although Lincoln believed it was not within Congress's power to free the slaves within the states, he approved the bill in deference to the legislature. He felt such action could only be taken by the Commander-in-Chief using war powers granted to the president by the Constitution, and Lincoln was planning to take that action. In that month, Lincoln discussed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet. In it, he stated that &quot;as a fit and necessary military measure, on January 1, 1863, all persons held as slaves in the Confederate states will thenceforward, and forever, be free&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 364–365.&lt;/ref&gt;

Privately, Lincoln concluded at this point that the slave base of the Confederacy had to be eliminated. However Copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification. Republican editor [[Horace Greeley]] of the highly influential ''New York Tribune'' fell for the ploy,&lt;ref&gt;McPherson (1992), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; and Lincoln refuted it directly in a shrewd letter of August 22, 1862. The President said the primary goal of his actions as president (he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his &quot;official duty&quot;) was preserving the Union:&lt;ref&gt;Guelzo (2004), pp. 147–153.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union&amp;nbsp;... [¶] I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty; and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free.&lt;ref&gt;Basler (1953), p. 388&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Emancipation Proclamation, issued on September 22, 1862, and put into effect on January 1, 1863, declared free the slaves in 10 states not then under Union control, with exemptions specified for areas already under Union control in two states.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 364, 379.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation, while Democrats rallied their voters in the 1862 off-year elections by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites.&lt;ref&gt;Louis P. Masur, ''Lincoln's Hundred Days: The Emancipation Proclamation and the War for the Union'' (Harvard University Press; 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective, as Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in Confederate territory were freed. Lincoln's comment on the signing of the Proclamation was: &quot;I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 407.&lt;/ref&gt; For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up [[Abraham Lincoln on slavery#Colonization|colonies]] for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt; A few days after Emancipation was announced, 13 Republican governors met at the [[War Governors' Conference]]; they supported the president's Proclamation, but suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union Army.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins (1960), pp. 2:239–240.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enlisting former slaves in the military was official government policy after the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation.  By the spring of 1863, Lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers. In a letter to [[Andrew Johnson]], the military governor of Tennessee, encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops, Lincoln wrote, &quot;The bare sight of 50,000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 430–431.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1863, at Lincoln's direction, General [[Lorenzo Thomas]] had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the Mississippi Valley.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick Douglass]] once observed of Lincoln: &quot;In his company, I was never reminded of my humble origin, or of my unpopular color&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Douglass, pp. 259–260.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lincolns Gettysburg Address, Gettysburg.JPG|thumb|left|The only confirmed photo of Abraham Lincoln at Gettysburg, some three hours before the speech.]]
With the great Union victory at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in July 1863, and the defeat of the Copperheads in the Ohio election in the fall, Lincoln maintained a strong base of party support and was in a strong position to redefine the war effort, despite the [[New York City draft riots]]. The stage was set for his address at the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery on November 19, 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 453–460.&lt;/ref&gt; Defying Lincoln's prediction that &quot;the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here,&quot; the Address became the most quoted speech in American history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bulla&quot;&gt;Bulla (2010), p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 272 words, and three minutes, Lincoln asserted the nation was born not in 1789, but in 1776, &quot;conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal&quot;. He defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all. The emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort. He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that slavery would end as a result of the losses, and the future of democracy in the world would be assured, that &quot;government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth&quot;. Lincoln concluded that the Civil War had a profound objective: a new birth of freedom in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 460–466.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wills, pp. 20, 27, 105, 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

===General Grant===
[[File:The Peacemakers 1868.jpg|alt=Painting of four men conferring in a ship's cabin, entitled &quot;The Peacemakers&quot;.|thumb|President Lincoln (center right) with, from left, Generals Sherman and Grant and Admiral Porter – [[The Peacemakers|1868 painting]] of events aboard the ''[[River Queen (steamboat)|River Queen]]'' in March 1865]]

Meade's failure to capture Lee's army as it retreated from Gettysburg, and the continued passivity of the Army of the Potomac, persuaded Lincoln that a change in command was needed. General [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s victories at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] and in the [[Vicksburg campaign]] impressed Lincoln and made Grant a strong candidate to head the Union Army. Responding to criticism of Grant after Shiloh, Lincoln had said, &quot;I can't spare this man. He fights.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (2008), p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt; With Grant in command, Lincoln felt the Union Army could relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters, and have a top commander who agreed on the use of black troops.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, ''Ordeal of the Union'' (Vol. IV), pp. 6–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Lincoln was concerned that Grant might be considering a candidacy for President in 1864, as McClellan was. Lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into Grant's political intentions, and being assured that he had none, submitted to the Senate Grant's promotion to commander of the Union Army. He obtained Congress's consent to reinstate for Grant the rank of Lieutenant General, which no officer had held since George Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 490–492.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant waged his bloody [[Overland Campaign]] in 1864. This is often characterized as a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]], given high Union losses at battles such as the [[Battle of the Wilderness]] and [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]]. Even though they had the advantage of fighting on the defensive, the Confederate forces had &quot;almost as high a percentage of casualties as the Union forces&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson (2009), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; The high casualty figures of the Union alarmed the North; Grant had lost a third of his army, and Lincoln asked what Grant's plans were, to which the general replied, &quot;I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 501.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Confederacy lacked reinforcements, so Lee's army shrank with every costly battle. Grant's army moved south, crossed the [[James River]], forcing a siege and trench warfare outside [[Petersburg, Virginia]]. Lincoln then made an extended visit to Grant's headquarters at City Point, Virginia. This allowed the president to confer in person with Grant and [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] about the hostilities, as Sherman coincidentally managed a hasty visit to Grant from his position in North Carolina.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehousehistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehousehistory.org/whha_about/whitehouse_collection/whitehouse_collection-art-06.html|title=The Peacemakers|publisher=The White House Historical Association|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62a8J9jOa|archivedate=2011-10-20|deadurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln and the Republican Party mobilized support for the draft throughout the North, and replaced the Union losses.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (2008), pp. 422–424.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln authorized Grant to target the Confederate infrastructure—such as plantations, railroads, and bridges—hoping to destroy the South's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. Grant's move to Petersburg resulted in the obstruction of three railroads between Richmond and the South. This strategy allowed Generals Sherman and [[Philip Sheridan]] to destroy plantations and towns in Virginia's [[Shenandoah Valley]]. The damage caused by [[Sherman's March to the Sea]] through Georgia in 1864 was limited to a {{convert|60|mi|km|adj=on}} swath, but neither Lincoln nor his commanders saw destruction as the main goal, but rather defeat of the Confederate armies. As Neely (2004) concludes, there was no effort to engage in &quot;[[total war]]&quot; against civilians, as in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Neely (2004), pp. 434–458.&lt;/ref&gt;

Confederate general [[Jubal Anderson Early]] began a series of assaults in the North that threatened the Capital. During Early's [[Battle of Fort Stevens|raid on Washington, D.C.]] in 1864, Lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position; Captain [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] shouted at him, &quot;Get down, you damn fool, before you get shot!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (2008), p. 434.&lt;/ref&gt; After repeated calls on Grant to defend Washington, Sheridan was appointed and the threat from Early was dispatched.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 516–518.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Grant continued to wear down Lee's forces, efforts to discuss peace began. Confederate Vice President [[Alexander H. Stephens|Stephens]] led a group to meet with Lincoln, Seward, and others at [[Hampton Roads]]. Lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the Confederacy as a coequal; his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 565.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 1, 1865, Grant successfully outflanked Lee's forces in the [[Battle of Five Forks]] and nearly encircled Petersburg, and the Confederate government evacuated Richmond. Days later, when that city fell, Lincoln visited the vanquished Confederate capital; as he walked through the city, white Southerners were stone-faced, but [[freedmen]] greeted him as a hero. On April 9, Lee surrendered to Grant at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox]] and the war was effectively over.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 589.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1864 re-election===
{{Main|Electoral history of Abraham Lincoln|United States presidential election, 1864}}
While the war was still being waged, Lincoln faced reelection in 1864. Lincoln was a master politician, bringing together—and holding together—all the main factions of the Republican Party, and bringing in [[War Democrats]] such as [[Edwin M. Stanton]] and [[Andrew Johnson]] as well. Lincoln spent many hours a week talking to politicians from across the land and using his patronage powers—greatly expanded over peacetime—to hold the factions of his party together, build support for his own policies, and fend off efforts by Radicals to drop him from the 1864 ticket.&lt;ref&gt;Fish, pp. 53–69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tegeder, pp. 77–90.&lt;/ref&gt; At its 1864 convention, the Republican Party selected Johnson, a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee, as his running mate. To broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans, Lincoln ran under the label of the new [[National Union Party (United States)|Union Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 494–507.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Grant's 1864 spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates and Union casualties mounted, the lack of military success wore heavily on the President's re-election prospects, and many Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated. Sharing this fear, Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that, if he should lose the election, he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over the White House:&lt;ref&gt;Grimsley, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|This morning, as for some days past, it seems exceedingly probable that this Administration will not be re-elected. Then it will be my duty to so co-operate with the President elect, as to save the Union between the election and the inauguration; as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterward.&lt;ref&gt;Basler (1953), p. 514.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.

While the Democratic platform followed the &quot;Peace wing&quot; of the party and called the war a &quot;failure&quot;, their candidate, General George B. McClellan, supported the war and repudiated the platform. Lincoln provided Grant with more troops and mobilized his party to renew its support of Grant in the war effort. Sherman's capture of Atlanta in September and [[David Farragut]]'s capture of Mobile ended defeatist jitters;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 531.&lt;/ref&gt; the Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln. By contrast, the National Union Party was united and energized as Lincoln made emancipation the central issue, and state Republican parties stressed the [[perfidy]] of the Copperheads.&lt;ref&gt;Randall &amp; Current (1955), p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln was re-elected in a landslide, carrying all but three states, and receiving 78 percent of the Union soldiers' vote.&lt;ref&gt;Paludan, pp. 274–293.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 4, 1865, Lincoln delivered his [[Lincoln's second inaugural address|second inaugural address]]. In it, he deemed the high casualties on both sides to be God's will. Historian [[Mark Noll]] concludes it ranks &quot;among the small handful of semi-sacred texts by which Americans conceive their place in the world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Noll, p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln said:

{{quote|Fondly do we hope—fervently do we pray—that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue, until all the wealth piled by the [[wikt:bondman|bond-man's]] 250 years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said 3,000 years ago, so still it must be said, &quot;the judgments of the Lord, are true and righteous altogether&quot;. With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan—to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Lincoln, ''Abraham Lincoln: Selected Speeches and Writings'' (Library of America edition, 2009) p 450&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Reconstruction===
{{Main|Reconstruction Era}}
Reconstruction began during the war, as Lincoln and his associates anticipated questions of how to reintegrate the conquered southern states, and how to determine the fates of Confederate leaders and freed slaves. Shortly after Lee's surrender, a general had asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated, and Lincoln replied, &quot;Let 'em up easy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (2008), pp. 509–512.&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with that sentiment, Lincoln led the moderates regarding Reconstruction policy, and was opposed by the Radical Republicans, under Rep. [[Thaddeus Stevens]], Sen. [[Charles Sumner]] and Sen. [[Benjamin Wade]], political allies of the president on other issues. Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war. His [[Ten percent plan|Amnesty Proclamation]] of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 471–472.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lincoln and Johnsond.jpg|alt=Cartoon of Lincoln and Johnson attempting to stitch up the broken Union|thumb|A political cartoon of Vice President Andrew Johnson (a former tailor) and Lincoln, 1865, entitled &quot;The 'Rail Splitter' At Work Repairing the Union.&quot; The caption reads (Johnson): ''Take it quietly Uncle Abe and I will draw it closer than ever.'' (Lincoln): ''A few more stitches Andy and the good old Union will be mended.'']]

As Southern states were subdued, critical decisions had to be made as to their leadership while their administrations were re-formed. Of special importance were Tennessee and Arkansas, where Lincoln appointed Generals [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[Frederick Steele]] as military governors, respectively. In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. Lincoln's Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations. On the other hand, the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the [[Wade-Davis Bill]], in 1864. When Lincoln vetoed the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 485–486.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's appointments were designed to keep both the moderate and Radical factions in harness. To fill Chief Justice Taney's seat on the Supreme Court, he named the choice of the Radicals, [[Salmon P. Chase]], who Lincoln believed would uphold the emancipation and paper money policies.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, ''Ordeal of the Union'', Vol IV., p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

After implementing the Emancipation Proclamation, which did not apply to every state, Lincoln increased pressure on Congress to outlaw slavery throughout the entire nation with a constitutional amendment. Lincoln declared that such an amendment would &quot;clinch the whole matter&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt; By December 1863, a proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw slavery was brought to Congress for passage. This first attempt at an amendment failed to pass, falling short of the required two-thirds majority on June 15, 1864, in the House of Representatives. Passage of the proposed amendment became part of the Republican/Unionist platform in the election of 1864. After a long debate in the House, a second attempt passed Congress on January 31, 1865, and was sent to the state legislatures for ratification.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 562–563.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/house-passes-the-13th-amendment |title=House passes the 13th Amendment — History.com This Day in History — 1/31/1865 |publisher=History.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon ratification, it became the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] to the United States Constitution on December 6, 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Primary Documents in American History: 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|url=http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/13thamendment.html|publisher=Library of Congress|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62a9BIwNw|archivedate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the war drew to a close, Lincoln's presidential Reconstruction for the South was in flux; having believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of [[freedmen]]. He signed into law Senator Charles Sumner's [[Freedmen's Bureau]] bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves. The law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. Lincoln stated that his Louisiana plan did not apply to all states under Reconstruction. Shortly before his assassination, Lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern Reconstruction. Discussions with his cabinet revealed Lincoln planned short-term military control over southern states, until readmission under the control of southern Unionists.&lt;ref&gt;Carwardine (2003), pp. 242–243.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly what Lincoln would have done about Reconstruction if he had lived, but they make projections based on his known policy positions and political acumen.

Lincoln biographers [[James G. Randall]] and [[Richard Current]], according to David Lincove, argue that:
:It is likely that had he lived, Lincoln would have followed a policy similar to Johnson's, that he would have clashed with congressional Radicals, that he would have produced a better result for the freedmen than occurred, and that his political skills would have helped him avoid Johnson's mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lincove|first=David A.|title=Reconstruction in the United States: An Annotated Bibliography|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3EQcT7-Dpi0C&amp;pg=PA80|year= 2000|publisher=Greenwood|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Foner]] argues that:
:Unlike Sumner and other Radicals, Lincoln did not see Reconstruction as an opportunity for a sweeping political and social revolution beyond emancipation. He had long made clear his opposition to the confiscation and redistribution of land. He believed, as most Republicans did in April 1865, that the voting requirements should be determined by the states. He assumed that political control in the South would pass to white Unionists, reluctant secessionists, and forward-looking former Confederates. But time and again during the war, Lincoln, after initial opposition, and come to embrace positions first advanced by abolitionists and Radical Republicans..... Lincoln undoubtedly would have listened carefully to the outcry for further protection for the former slaves.... It is entirely plausible to imagine Lincoln and Congress agreeing on a Reconstruction policy that encompassed federal protection for basic civil rights plus limited black suffrage, along the lines Lincoln proposed just before his death.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foner|first=Eric|title=The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4b8m7cv3wTIC&amp;pg=PA335|year=2010|publisher=W. W. Norton|pages=334–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Redefining the republic and republicanism===
[[File:Abraham Lincoln O-116 by Gardner, 1865-crop.png|thumb|upright|left|alt=An older tired looking Lincoln with a beard.|Lincoln in February 1865, about two months before his death.]]

The successful reunification of the states had consequences for the name of the country. The term &quot;the United States&quot; has historically been used, sometimes in the plural (&quot;these United States&quot;), and other times in the singular, without any particular grammatical consistency. The Civil War was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Presidential Proclamation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/12/presidential-proclamation-civil-war-sesquicentennial|title=Presidential Proclamation-Civil War Sesquicentennial|publisher=The White House|date=April 12, 2011|quote=...&amp;nbsp;a new meaning was conferred on our country's name&amp;nbsp;... |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62aAPoA6B|archivedate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, historians such as Harry Jaffa, Herman Belz, John Diggins, Vernon Burton and Eric Foner have stressed Lincoln's redefinition of [[Republicanism in the United States|republican values]]. As early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution, Lincoln redirected emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values—what he called the &quot;sheet anchor&quot; of republicanism.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffa, p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all, in contrast to the Constitution's tolerance of slavery, shifted the debate. As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech of early 1860, &quot;Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Diggins, p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt; His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms.&lt;ref&gt;Foner (2010), p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in 1861, Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffa, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; Burton (2008) argues that Lincoln's republicanism was taken up by the Freedmen as they were emancipated.&lt;ref&gt;Orville Vernon Burton, ''The Age of Lincoln'' (2008) p 243&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1861, in his [[Lincoln's first inaugural address|First Inaugural Address]], Lincoln explored the nature of democracy. He denounced secession as anarchy, and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints in the American system. He said &quot;A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Belz (1998), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Clear}}

===Other enactments===
Lincoln adhered to the Whig theory of the presidency, which gave Congress primary responsibility for writing the laws while the Executive enforced them. Lincoln only vetoed four bills passed by Congress; the only important one was the Wade-Davis Bill with its harsh program of Reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (2001), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; He signed the [[Homestead Act]] in 1862, making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]], also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state. The [[Pacific Railway Acts]] of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], which was completed in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;Paludan, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was made possible by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson (1993), pp. 450–452.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the Federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent), and a new Federal income tax. In 1861, Lincoln signed the second and third [[Morrill Tariff]], the first having become law under James Buchanan. Also in 1861, Lincoln signed the [[Revenue Act of 1861]], creating the first U.S. income tax.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt; This created a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|800|1861|r=-2}}}} in current dollar terms), which was later changed by the [[Revenue Act of 1862]] to a progressive rate structure.&lt;ref&gt;Paludan, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln also presided over the expansion of the federal government's economic influence in several other areas. The creation of the system of national banks by the [[National Banking Act]] provided a strong financial network in the country. It also established a national currency. In 1862, Congress created, with Lincoln's approval, the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald 2001 p. 424&quot;&gt;Donald (2001), p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1862, Lincoln sent a senior general, John Pope, to put down the &quot;[[Dakota War of 1862|Sioux Uprising]]&quot; in Minnesota. Presented with 303 execution warrants for convicted [[Sioux#Santee (Isáŋyathi or Eastern Dakota)|Santee Dakota]] who were accused of killing innocent farmers, Lincoln conducted his own personal review of each of these warrants, eventually approving 39 for execution (one was later reprieved).&lt;ref&gt;Cox, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; President Lincoln had planned to reform federal Indian policy.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, pp. 210–232.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of Grant's casualties in his campaign against Lee, Lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft, but it was never issued. In response to rumors of one, however, the editors of the ''[[New York World]]'' and the ''[[The Journal of Commerce|Journal of Commerce]]'' published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market. Lincoln's reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior; he ordered the military to seize the two papers. The seizure lasted for two days.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 501–502.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln is largely responsible for the institution of the [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving holiday]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald 1996, p. 471&quot;&gt;Donald (1996), p. 471.&lt;/ref&gt; Before Lincoln's presidency, Thanksgiving, while a regional holiday in New England since the 17th century, had been proclaimed by the federal government only sporadically and on irregular dates. The last such proclamation had been during [[James Madison]]'s presidency 50 years before. In 1863, Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November of that year to be a day of Thanksgiving.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald 1996, p. 471&quot;/&gt; In June 1864, Lincoln approved the Yosemite Grant enacted by Congress, which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as [[Yosemite National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schaffer|first=Jeffrey P.|title=Yosemite National Park: A Natural History Guide to Yosemite and Its Trails|publisher=Wilderness Press|page=48|location=Berkeley|year=1999|isbn=0-89997-244-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mathew Brady, Portrait of Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase, officer of the United States government (1860–1865, full version).jpg|thumb|right|[[Salmon Portland Chase]] was Lincoln's choice to be [[Chief Justice of the United States]].]]
Lincoln's declared philosophy on court nominations was that &quot;we cannot ask a man what he will do, and if we should, and he should answer us, we should despise him for it. Therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald 1996, p. 471&quot;/&gt; Lincoln made five appointments to the United States Supreme Court. [[Noah Haynes Swayne]], nominated January 21, 1862 and appointed January 24, 1862, was chosen as an anti-slavery lawyer who was committed to the Union. [[Samuel Freeman Miller]], nominated and appointed on July 16, 1862, supported Lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist. [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]], Lincoln's campaign manager in 1860, nominated December 1, 1862 and appointed December 8, 1862, had also served as a judge in Lincoln's Illinois court circuit. [[Stephen Johnson Field]], a previous California Supreme Court justice, was nominated March 6, 1863 and appointed March 10, 1863, and provided geographic balance, as well as political balance to the court as a Democrat. Finally, Lincoln's Treasury Secretary, [[Salmon P. Chase]], was nominated as Chief Justice, and appointed the same day, on December 6, 1864. Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist, would support Reconstruction legislation, and that his appointment united the Republican Party.&lt;ref&gt;Blue, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other judicial appointments====
Lincoln appointed 32 federal judges, including four Associate Justices and one Chief Justice to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], and 27 judges to the [[United States district courts]]. Lincoln appointed no judges to the [[United States circuit court]]s during his time in office.

===States admitted to the Union===
[[West Virginia]], admitted to the Union June 20, 1863, contained the former north-westernmost counties of Virginia that seceded from Virginia after that commonwealth declared its secession from the Union. As a condition for its admission, West Virginia's constitution was required to provide for the gradual abolition of slavery. [[Nevada]], which became the third State in the far-west of the continent, was admitted as a free state on October 31, 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 300, 539.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assassination==
{{main|Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Funeral and burial of Abraham Lincoln}}
[[John Wilkes Booth]] was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 586–587.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864, Booth formulated a plan (very similar to one of Thomas N. Conrad previously authorized by the Confederacy)&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 587.&lt;/ref&gt; to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners. [[File:The Assassination of President Lincoln - Currier and Ives 2.png|thumb|left||alt=A drawing of Lincoln being shot by Booth while sitting in a theater booth.|Shown in the presidential booth of Ford's Theatre, from left to right, are [[Henry Rathbone]], [[Clara Harris]], [[Mary Todd Lincoln]], Abraham Lincoln, and his assassin [[John Wilkes Booth]].]] After attending an April 11, 1865, speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, an incensed Booth changed his plans and became determined to assassinate the president.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison (2000), pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Learning that the President, First Lady, and head Union general Ulysses S. Grant would be attending [[Ford's Theatre]], Booth formulated a plan with co-conspirators to assassinate Vice President [[Andrew Johnson]], Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] and General Grant. Without his main bodyguard, [[Ward Hill Lamon]], Lincoln left to attend the play ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' on April 14. Grant, along with his wife, chose at the last minute to travel to Philadelphia instead of attending the play.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 594–597.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's bodyguard, John Parker, left Ford's Theater during intermission to join Lincoln's coachman for drinks in the Star Saloon next door. The now unguarded President sat in his state box in the balcony. Seizing the opportunity, Booth crept up from behind and at about 10:13&amp;nbsp;pm, aimed at the back of Lincoln's head and fired at point-blank range, mortally wounding the President. Major [[Henry Rathbone]] momentarily grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 597.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Lincolns-Missing-Bodyguard.html|title=Lincoln's Missing Bodyguard|first=Paul|last=Martin|date=April 8, 2010|work=Smithsonian Magazine|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62aAqLOzq|archivedate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being on the run for 10 days, Booth was tracked down and found on a farm in Virginia, some {{convert|70|mi|km}} south of Washington, D.C. After a brief fight with Union troops, Booth was killed by Sergeant [[Boston Corbett]] on April 26.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 599.&lt;/ref&gt;

An Army surgeon, Doctor [[Charles Leale]], was sitting nearby at the theater and immediately assisted the President. He found the President unresponsive, barely breathing and with no detectable pulse. Having determined that the President had been shot in the head, and not stabbed in the shoulder as originally thought, he made an attempt to clear the blood clot, after which the President began to breathe more naturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/report-first-doctor-reach-shot-lincoln-found-175353998.html|title=Report of first doctor to reach shot Lincoln found}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dying President was taken across the street to [[Petersen House]]. After remaining in a coma for nine hours, Lincoln died at 7:22&amp;nbsp;am on April 15. Presbyterian minister [[Phineas Densmore Gurley]], then present, was asked to offer a prayer, after which Secretary of War Stanton saluted and said, &quot;Now he belongs to the ages.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 598–599, 686. Witnesses have provided other versions of the quote, i.e. &quot;He now belongs to the ages.&quot; and &quot;He is a man for the ages.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's flag-enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the White House by bareheaded Union officers, while the city's church bells rang. President Johnson was sworn in at 10:00&amp;nbsp;am, less than 3 hours after Lincoln's death. The late President lay in state in the East Room, and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 through April 21. For his final journey with his son Willie, both caskets were transported in the executive coach &quot;'''United States'''&quot; and for three weeks the ''Lincoln Special'' [[Funeral and burial of Abraham Lincoln#Funeral train|funeral train]] decorated in black bunting&lt;ref&gt;

As a young man, Lincoln was a [[religious skepticism|religious skeptic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Douglas L. Wilson|title=Honor's Voice: The Transformation of Abraham Lincoln|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KCM50uZMsQMC&amp;pg=PA84|year=1999|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|page=84|isbn=978-0-307-76581-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, in the words of a biographer, even an [[iconoclasm|iconoclast]].&lt;ref&gt;Carwardine (2003), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in life, Lincoln's frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to appeal to his audiences, who were mostly [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;Carwardine (1997), pp. 27–55.&lt;/ref&gt; He never joined a church, although he frequently attended with his wife.&lt;ref&gt;On claims that Lincoln was baptized by an associate of [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]], see {{cite journal|url=http://www.acu.edu/sponsored/restoration_quarterly/archives/1990s/vol_38_no_2_contents/martin.html|last=Martin|first=Jim|title=The secret baptism of Abraham Lincoln|journal=Restoration Quarterly|volume=38|issue=2|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was deeply familiar with the Bible, quoted it and praised it.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 48–49, 514–515.&lt;/ref&gt; He was private about his beliefs and respected the beliefs of others.  Lincoln never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs. However he did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events and, by 1865, was expressing those beliefs in major speeches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark A. Noll|title=A History of Christianity in the United States and Canada|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VGF3wbzzy9QC&amp;pg=PA322|year=1992|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans|pages=321–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1840s Lincoln subscribed to the Doctrine of Necessity, a belief that asserted the human mind was controlled by some higher power.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1850s, Lincoln acknowledged &quot;providence&quot; in a general way, and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals; he regarded the republicanism of the Founding Fathers with an almost religious reverence.&lt;ref&gt;Grant R. Brodrecht, ''&quot;Our country&quot;: Northern evangelicals and the Union during the Civil War and Reconstruction'' (2008) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; When he suffered the death of his son Edward, Lincoln more frequently acknowledged his own need to depend on God.&lt;ref&gt;Parrillo, pp. 227–253.&lt;/ref&gt; The death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look toward religion for answers and solace.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 251–254.&lt;/ref&gt; After Willie's death, Lincoln considered why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary. He wrote at this time that God &quot;could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest. Yet the contest began. And having begun He could give the final victory to either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; On the day Lincoln was assassinated, he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the [[Holy Land]].&lt;ref&gt;Guelzo (1999), p. 434&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical reputation==
{{see also|Abraham Lincoln cultural depictions}}
In [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|surveys of scholars ranking Presidents]]&lt;!--Lincoln is 1st in 9 of 17 on that page--&gt; since the 1940s, Lincoln is consistently ranked in the top three, often #1.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ranking Our Presidents&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gallup&quot;/&gt; A 2004 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked Lincoln number one, while legal scholars placed him second after Washington.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taranto&quot;&gt;Taranto, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; Of all the presidential ranking polls conducted since 1948, Lincoln has been rated at the very top in the majority of polls: Schlesinger 1948, Schlesinger 1962, 1982 Murray Blessing Survey, ''Chicago Tribune'' 1982 poll, Schlesinger 1996, CSPAN 1996, Ridings-McIver 1996, ''Time'' 2008, and CSPAN 2009. Generally, the top three presidents are rated as 1. Lincoln; 2. George Washington; and 3. Franklin D. Roosevelt, although Lincoln and Washington, and Washington and Roosevelt, occasionally are reversed.&lt;ref&gt;Densen, John V., Editor, ''Reassessing The Presidency, The Rise of the Executive State and the Decline of Freedom'' (Ludwig von Mises Institute, 2001), pgs. 1–32; Ridings, William H., &amp; Stuard B. McIver, ''Rating The Presidents, A Ranking of U.S. Leaders, From the Great and Honorable to the Dishonest and Incompetent'' (Citadel Press, Kensington Publishing Corp., 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

President Lincoln's assassination made him a national martyr and endowed him with a recognition of mythic proportion. Lincoln was viewed by abolitionists as a champion for human liberty. Republicans linked Lincoln's name to their party. Many, though not all, in the South considered Lincoln as a man of outstanding ability.&lt;ref&gt;Chesebrough, pp. 76, 79, 106, 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lincoln Museum Exterior.jpg|alt=Exterior photograph of museum|thumb|left|The [[Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum]] focuses on Lincoln scholarship and popular interpretation]]

Schwartz argues that Lincoln's reputation grew slowly in the late 19th century until the [[Progressive Era]] (1900–1920s) when he emerged as one of the most venerated heroes in American history, with even white Southerners in agreement. The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] on the Mall in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz (2000), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[New Deal]] era liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who doubtless would have supported the welfare state. In the [[Cold War]] years, Lincoln's image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz (2009), pp. 23, 91–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s Lincoln had become a hero to [[Conservatism in the United States|political conservatives]]&lt;ref&gt;Havers, p. 96. Apart from neo-Confederates such as [[Mel Bradford]] who denounced his treatment of the white South.&lt;/ref&gt; for his intense nationalism, support for business, his insistence on stopping the spread of human bondage, his acting in terms of [[John Locke|Lockean]] and [[Edmund Burke|Burkean]] principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition, and his devotion to the principles of the Founding Fathers.&lt;ref&gt;Belz (2006), pp. 514–518.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graebner, pp. 67–94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp. 43–45.&lt;/ref&gt; As a Whig activist, Lincoln was a spokesman for business interests, favoring high tariffs, banks, internal improvements, and railroads in opposition to the [[Jacksonian Democracy|agrarian Democrats]].&lt;ref&gt;Boritt (1994), pp. 196, 198, 228, 301.&lt;/ref&gt; William C. Harris found that Lincoln's &quot;reverence for the Founding Fathers, the Constitution, the laws under it, and the preservation of the Republic and its institutions undergirded and strengthened his conservatism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; James G. Randall emphasizes his tolerance and especially his moderation &quot;in his preference for orderly progress, his distrust of dangerous agitation, and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform&quot;. Randall concludes that, &quot;he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so-called 'radicalism' which involved abuse of the South, hatred for the slaveholder, thirst for vengeance, partisan plotting, and ungenerous demands that Southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Randall (1947), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1960s, liberals, such as historian [[Lerone Bennett, Jr.|Lerone Bennett]], were having second thoughts, especially regarding Lincoln's views on racial issues.&lt;ref&gt;Zilversmit, pp. 22–24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett won wide attention when he called Lincoln a white supremacist in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, pp. 35–42.&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that Lincoln used ethnic slurs, told jokes that ridiculed blacks, insisted he opposed social equality, and proposed [[American Colonization Society|sending freed slaves]] to another country. Defenders, such as authors Dirck and Cashin, retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day;&lt;ref&gt;Dirck (2008), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; and that he was a &quot;moral visionary&quot; who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause, as fast as politically possible.&lt;ref&gt;Striner, pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis shifted away from Lincoln-the-emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery, or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;Cashin, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelley &amp; Lewis, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Barry Schwartz wrote in 2009 that Lincoln's image suffered &quot;erosion, fading prestige, benign ridicule&quot; in the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz (2009), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Donald opined in his 1996 biography that Lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of [[negative capability]], defined by the poet [[John Keats]] and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were &quot;content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts, and not compelled toward fact or reason&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln has often been portrayed by Hollywood, almost always in a flattering light.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Spielberg, Doris Kearns Goodwin,  and Tony Kushner, &quot;Mr. Lincoln Goes to Hollywood&quot;, ''Smithsonian'' (2012) 43#7 pp. 46–53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn Stokes, &quot;Abraham Lincoln and the Movies&quot;, ''American Nineteenth Century History'' 12 (June 2011), 203–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barry Schwartz, a sociologist who has examined America's cultural memory, argues that in the 1930s and 1940s, the memory of Abraham Lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with &quot;a moral symbol inspiring and guiding American life&quot;. During the Great Depression, he argues,  Lincoln served &quot;as a means for seeing the world's disappointments, for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful&quot;. Franklin D. Roosevelt, preparing America for war, used the words of the Civil War president to clarify the threat posed by Germany and Japan. Americans asked, &quot;What would Lincoln do?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barry Schwartz, ''Abraham Lincoln in the Post-Heroic Era: History and Memory in Late Twentieth-Century America''  (2009)  pp. xi, 9, 24&lt;/ref&gt; However, he also finds that since World War II, Lincoln's symbolic power has lost relevance, and this &quot;fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Schwartz, ''Abraham Lincoln in the Post-Heroic Era: History and Memory in Late Twentieth-Century America''  (2009)  p. xi, 9&lt;/ref&gt;  He suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept.

'''Aristotle''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|r|ɪ|ˌ|s|t|ɒ|t|əl}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/aristotle &quot;Aristotle&quot;] entry in ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]'', HarperCollins Publishers, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἀριστοτέλης}} {{IPA-grc|aristotélɛːs}}, ''Aristotélēs''; 384{{spaced ndash}}{{BCE|link|322}})&lt;ref&gt;That these undisputed dates (the first half of the Olympiad year 384/383 BCE, and in 322 shortly before the death of Demosthenes) are correct was shown already by [[August Boeckh]] (''Kleine Schriften'' VI 195); for further discussion, see [[Felix Jacoby]] on ''[[FGrHist]]'' 244 F 38. Ingemar Düring, ''Aristotle in the Ancient Biographical Tradition'', Göteborg, 1957, {{p.|253}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Greeks|Greek]] philosopher born in [[Stagirus]], northern [[Greece]], in {{BCE|link|384}}. His father, [[Nicomachus (father of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]], died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter [[Proxenus of Atarneus]] became his guardian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography of Aristotle|url=http://www.biography.com/people/aristotle-9188415?page=1#early-life|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At eighteen, he joined [[Plato's Academy]] in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven ([[Circa|c.]]&amp;nbsp;{{BCE|347}}). His writings cover many subjects{{spaced ndash}}including [[Physics (Aristotle)|physics]], [[biology]], [[zoology]], [[metaphysics]], [[logic]], ethics, [[aesthetics]], [[Poetics (Aristotle)|poetry]], theater, music, [[rhetoric]], [[linguistics]], politics and government{{spaced ndash}}and constitute the first comprehensive system of [[Western philosophy]]. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of [[Philip of Macedonia]], tutored [[Alexander the Great]] between 356 and {{BCE|323}}. According to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], &quot;Aristotle was the first genuine scientist in history.&amp;nbsp;... Every scientist is in his debt.&quot;{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Teaching Alexander the Great gave Aristotle many opportunities and an abundance of supplies. He established a library in the [[Lyceum]] which aided in the production of many of his hundreds of books. The fact that Aristotle was a pupil of Plato contributed to his former views of [[Platonism]], but, following Plato's death, Aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from Platonism to [[empiricism]].{{sfn|Barnes|2007|p=6}} He believed all peoples' concepts and all of their knowledge was ultimately based on perception. Aristotle's views on [[natural science]]s represent the groundwork underlying many of his works.

Aristotle's views on [[Aristotelian physics|physical science]] profoundly shaped medieval scholarship. Their influence extended into the [[Renaissance]] and were not replaced systematically until [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]] and theories such as [[classical mechanics]]. Some of Aristotle's zoological observations were not confirmed or refuted until the 19th century.{{examples|date=February 2014}} His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, which was incorporated in the late 19th century into modern [[formal logic]].

In metaphysics, [[Aristotelianism]] profoundly influenced [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800–1400)|Judeo-Islamic philosophical and theological thought]] during the [[Middle Ages]] and continues to influence [[Christian theology]], especially the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition of the [[Catholic Church]]. Aristotle was well known among medieval Muslim intellectuals and revered as &quot;The First Teacher&quot; ({{lang-ar|{{big|المعلم الأول}}}}).

His ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of [[virtue ethics]]. All aspects of Aristotle's philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today. Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues{{spaced ndash}}[[Cicero]] described his literary style as &quot;a river of gold&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cicero |first=Marcus Tullius |title=Flumen orationis aureum fundens Aristoteles |work=Academica |publisher= |date=106–43 BC |url=http://www2.cddc.vt.edu/gutenberg/1/4/9/7/14970/14970-h/14970-h.htm#BkII_119 |doi= |accessdate=25 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{spaced ndash}}it is thought that only around a third of his original output has survived.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Barnes]], &quot;Life and Work&quot; in ''The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle'' (1995), {{p.|9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==

Aristotle, whose name means &quot;the best purpose&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Campbell |first=Michael |title=Behind the Name: Meaning, Origin and History of the Name &quot;Aristotle&quot; |url=http://www.behindthename.com/name/aristotle |work=Behind the Name: The Etymology and History of First Names |publisher=www.behindthename.com |accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was born in {{BCE|384}} in [[Stagira (ancient city)|Stagira]], [[Chalcidice]], about 55&amp;nbsp;km (34 miles) east of modern-day [[Thessaloniki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Aristotle: The Great Philosophers |author=McLeisch, Kenneth Cole |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |isbn=0-415-92392-1 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father [[Nicomachus (father of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]] was the personal physician to [[Amyntas III of Macedon|King Amyntas of]] [[Macedon]].  Although there is little information on Aristotle's childhood, he probably spent some time within the Macedonian palace, making his first connections with the Macedonian monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Anagnostopoulos, G., &quot;Aristotle's Life&quot; in ''A Companion to Aristotle'' (Blackwell Publishing, 2009), {{p.|4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the age of eighteen, Aristotle moved to [[Athens]] to continue his education at [[Platonic Academy|Plato's Academy]]. He remained there for nearly twenty years before leaving Athens in {{BCE|348/47}}. The traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the Academy's direction after control passed to Plato's nephew [[Speusippus]], although it is possible that he feared anti-Macedonian sentiments and left before Plato had died.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lord Intro&quot;&gt;Carnes Lord, introduction to ''The Politics'' by Aristotle (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle and Plato's compatibility has been a strongly debated topic. Recently, [[Harold Cherniss]] summarized Aristotle's Platonism from the standpoint of [[Classics|classicist]] [[Werner Jaeger]], stating that: &quot;Jaeger, in whose eyes Plato's philosophy was the &quot;matter&quot; out of which the newer and higher form of Aristotle's thought proceeded by a gradual but steady and undeviating development (''Aristotles'', {{p.|11}}), pronounced the &quot;old controversy&quot;, whether or not Aristotle understood Plato, to be &quot;''absolut verstandnislos''&quot;. Yet this did not prevent Leisegang{{who|date=February 2014}} from reasserting that Aristotle's own pattern of thinking was incompatible with a proper understanding of Plato.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cherniss, Harold (1962). ''Aristotle's Criticism of Plato and the Academy'', Russell and Russell, Inc., {{p.|xi}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Aristoteles: Grundlegung einer Geschichte seiner Entwicklung'' (1923; English trans. Richard Robinson (1902–1996) as ''Aristotle: Fundamentals of the History of His Development'', 1934).&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to Leisegang's sympathies, Jaeger was sympathetic to a compatible reading of Aristotle and Plato.

Aristotle then accompanied [[Xenocrates]] to the court of his friend [[Hermias of Atarneus]] in [[Asia Minor]]. There, he traveled with [[Theophrastus]] to the island of [[Lesbos]], where together they researched the [[botany]] and zoology of the island. Aristotle married [[Pythias]], either Hermias's adoptive daughter or niece. She bore him a daughter, whom they also named Pythias. Soon after Hermias' death, Aristotle was invited by [[Philip II of Macedon]] to become the tutor to his son [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] in {{BCE|343}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;philosophy1972&quot;&gt;Bertrand Russell, ''A History of Western Philosophy'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arabic aristotle.jpg|thumb|An early Islamic portrayal of Aristotle (right) and [[Alexander the Great]].]]

Aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of [[Macedon]]. During that time he gave lessons not only to Alexander, but also to two other future kings: [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] and [[Cassander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Green&quot;&gt;Peter Green, ''Alexander of Macedon'', University of California Press Ltd. (Oxford, England) 1991, {{p.|58|59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle encouraged Alexander toward eastern conquest and his attitude towards [[Persia]] was unabashedly [[Ethnocentricism|ethnocentric]]. In one famous example, he counsels Alexander to be &quot;a leader to the Greeks and a despot to the barbarians, to look after the former as after friends and relatives, and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Green&quot;/&gt;

By {{BCE|335}}, Artistotle had returned to Athens, establishing his own school there known as the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]]. Aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years. While in Athens, his wife Pythias died and Aristotle became involved with [[Herpyllis]] of Stagira, who bore him a son whom he named after his father, [[Nicomachus (son of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]]. According to the [[Suda]], he also had an [[eromenos]], [[Palaephatus|Palaephatus of Abydus]].&lt;ref&gt;William George Smith,''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', {{vol.|3}}, [http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/2421.html {{p.|88}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

This period in Athens, between 335 and {{BCE|323}}, is when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works.&lt;ref name=&quot;philosophy1972&quot;/&gt; He wrote many dialogues of which only fragments have survived. Those works that have survived are in [[treatise]] form and were not, for the most part, intended for widespread publication; they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students. His most important treatises include ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', ''[[De Anima]]'' (''On the Soul'') and ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''.

Aristotle not only studied almost every subject possible at the time, but made significant contributions to most of them. In physical science, Aristotle studied anatomy, astronomy, [[embryology]], geography, geology, meteorology, physics and zoology. In philosophy, he wrote on aesthetics, ethics, government, metaphysics, politics, economics, psychology, rhetoric and theology. He also studied education, foreign customs, literature and poetry. His combined works constitute a virtual encyclopedia of Greek knowledge.

Near the end of his life, Alexander became [[Paranoia|paranoid]] and wrote threatening letters to Aristotle. Aristotle had made no secret of his contempt for Alexander's pretense of divinity and the king had executed Aristotle's grandnephew [[Callisthenes]] as a traitor. A widespread tradition in antiquity suspected Aristotle of playing a role in Alexander's death, but there is little evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Green, ''Alexander of Macedon'', University of California Press Ltd. (Oxford, England), 1991, {{p.|379}} and 459.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Alexander's death, anti-Macedonian sentiment in Athens was rekindled. In {{BCE|322}}, [[Eurymedon the Hierophant]] denounced Aristotle for not holding the gods in honor, prompting him to flee to his mother's family estate in [[Chalcis]], explaining: &quot;I will not allow the Athenians to sin twice against philosophy&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=W. T. |title=The Classical Mind: A History of Western Philosophy |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |year=1980 |page=216 |isbn=0155383124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Vita Marciana'' 41, cf. [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] ''Varia historica'' 3.36, Ingemar Düring, ''Aristotle in the Ancient Biographical Tradition'', Göteborg, 1957, T44a-e.&lt;/ref&gt;{{spaced ndash}}a reference to Athens's prior [[Trial of Socrates|trial and execution of Socrates]]. He died in Euboea of [[natural causes]] later that same year, having named his student [[Antipater]] as his chief [[executor]] and leaving a [[Will (law)|will]] in which he asked to be buried next to his wife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=ifqGuiHo6eQC&amp;pg=PA3862&amp;dq=Antipater+Aristotle+will&amp;sig=sQzQVBdRmk-spNdZnyd1MwzAPTc Aristotle's Will], ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' by Hildegard Temporini, Wolfgang Haase.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the details of the life of Aristotle are not well-established.  The biographies of Aristotle written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient points.&lt;ref&gt;See Shields, C., &quot;Aristotle's Philosophical Life and Writings&quot; in ''The Oxford Handbook of Aristotle'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 2012), {{pp.|3|16}}. Düring, I., ''Aristotle in the Ancient Biographical Tradition'' (Göteborg, 1957) is a collection of [an overview of?] ancient biographies of Aristotle.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Memory ==

According to Aristotle, [[memory]] is the ability to hold a perceived experience in your mind and to have the ability to distinguish between the internal &quot;appearance&quot; and an occurrence in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bloch |first=David |url=http://books.google.com/?id=QwTHng_5RqAC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=Aristotle+on+Memory+and+Recollection#v=onepage&amp;q=Aristotle%20on%20Memory%20and%20Recollection&amp;f=false |title=Aristotle on Memory and Recollection |year=2007 |page=12|isbn=9004160469 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a memory is a mental picture ([[wikt:phantasm|phantasm]]) in which Aristotle defines in ''De Anima'', as an appearance which is imprinted on the part of the body that forms a memory. Aristotle believed an &quot;imprint&quot; becomes impressed on a semi-fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory. A memory occurs when a [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] is too complex that the nervous system (semi-fluid bodily organ) cannot receive all the impressions at once. These changes are the same as those involved in the operations of [[sense|sensation]], [[common sense]], and [[thinking]] .{{sfn|Bloch|2007|p=61}} The mental picture imprinted on the bodily organ is the final product of the entire process of sense perception. It does not matter if the experience was seen or heard, every experience ends up as a mental image in memory
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carruthers |first=Mary |url=http://books.google.com/?id=dntrAnqfIasC&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq=The+book+of+memory:+the+study+of+memory+in+medieval+times#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20book%20of%20memory%3A%20the%20study%20of%20memory%20in%20medieval%20times&amp;f=false |title=The Book of Memory: A Study of Memory in Medieval Culture |year=2007 |page=16|isbn=9780521429733 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle uses the word &quot;memory&quot; for two basic abilities. First, the actual retaining of the experience in the [[mnemonic]] &quot;imprint&quot; that can develop from sensation. Second, the intellectual anxiety that comes with the &quot;imprint&quot; due to being impressed at a particular time and processing specific contents. These abilities can be explained as memory is neither sensation nor thinking because is arises only after a lapse of time. Therefore, memory is of the past, {{sfn|Bloch|2007|p=25}} prediction is of the future, and sensation is of the present. The retrieval of our &quot;imprints&quot; cannot be performed suddenly. A transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences, both for our previous experience and present experience.

Aristotle proposed that slow-witted people have good memory because the fluids in their brain do not wash away their memory organ used to imprint experiences and so the &quot;imprint&quot; can easily continue. However, they cannot be too slow or the hardened surface of the organ will not receive new &quot;imprints&quot;. He believed the young and the old do not properly develop an &quot;imprint&quot;. Young people undergo rapid changes as they develop, while the elderly's organs are beginning to decay, thus stunting new &quot;imprints&quot;. Likewise, people who are too quick-witted are similar to the young and the image cannot be fixed because of the rapid changes of their organ. Because intellectual functions are not involved in memory, memories belong to some animals too, but only those in which have [[perception]] of time.

===Recollection===
Because Aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and people perceive them as images or &quot;imprints&quot;, people are continually weaving together new &quot;imprints&quot; of things they experience. In order to search for these &quot;imprints&quot;, people search the memory itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Warren |first=Howard |url=http://books.google.com/?id=D4IXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=The+history+of+the+association+of+psychology#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20history%20of%20the%20association%20of%20psychology&amp;f=false |title=A History of the Association Psychology |year=1921 |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the memory, if one [[experience]] is offered instead of a specific memory, that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for. [[Recall (memory)|Recollection]] occurs when one experience naturally follows another. If the chain of &quot;images&quot; is needed, one memory will stimulate the other. If the chain of &quot;images&quot; is not needed, but expected, then it will only stimulate the other memory in most instances. When people recall experiences, they stimulate certain previous experiences until they have stimulated the one that was needed .{{sfn|Warren|1921|p=25}}

Recollection is the self-directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory &quot;imprint&quot; after some time has passed. Retrieval of stored information is dependent on the scope of mnemonic capabilities of a being (human or animal) and the abilities the human or animal possesses .{{sfn|Carruthers|2007|p=19}} Only humans will remember &quot;imprints&quot; of intellectual activity, such as numbers and words. Animals that have perception of time will be able to retrieve memories of their past observations. Remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed. Recollection of an &quot;imprint&quot; is when the present experiences a person remembers are similar with elements corresponding in character and arrangement of past sensory experiences. When an &quot;imprint&quot; is recalled, it may bring forth a large group of related &quot;imprints&quot; .{{sfn|Warren|1921|p=296}}

Aristotle believed the chain of thought, which ends in recollection of certain &quot;imprints&quot;, was connected systematically in three sorts of relationships: similarity, contrast, and contiguity. These three laws make up his [[Laws of Association]]. Aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within our mind. A force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience. According to Aristotle, association is the power innate in a mental state, which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences, allowing them to rise and be recalled .{{sfn|Warren|1921|p=259}}

== Thought ==

===Logic===
[[File:Aristotle in Nuremberg Chronicle.jpg|thumb|upright|Aristotle portrayed in the 1493 ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' as a scholar of the 15th century CE.]]
{{main|Term logic}}
{{details|Non-Aristotelian logic}}
With the ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', Aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic,&lt;ref&gt;MICHAEL DEGNAN, 1994. Recent Work in Aristotle's Logic. ''Philosophical Books'' 35.2 (April 1994): 81–89.&lt;/ref&gt; and his conception of it was the dominant form of Western logic until 19th century advances in [[mathematical logic]].&lt;ref&gt;Corcoran, John (2009). &quot;Aristotle's Demonstrative Logic&quot;. History and Philosophy of Logic, 30: 1–20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] stated in the ''Critique of Pure Reason'' that Aristotle's theory of logic completely accounted for the core of [[deductive inference]].

====History====
Aristotle &quot;says that 'on the subject of reasoning' he 'had nothing else on an earlier date to speak of'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last =Bocheński
 | first =I. M.
 | title =Ancient Formal Logic
 | publisher =North-Holland Publishing Company
 | year =1951
 | location =Amsterdam
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Plato reports that [[syntax]] was devised before him, by [[Prodicus of Ceos]], who was concerned by the correct use of words. Logic seems to have emerged from [[dialectics]]; the earlier philosophers made frequent use of concepts like ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' in their discussions, but never truly understood the logical implications. Even Plato had difficulties with logic; although he had a reasonable conception of a [[deductive system]], he could never actually construct one, thus he relied instead on his [[dialectic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bocheński, 1951&quot;&gt;Bocheński, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato believed that deduction would simply follow from [[premise]]s, hence he focused on maintaining solid premises so that the [[Logical consequence|conclusion]] would logically follow. Consequently, Plato realized that a method for obtaining conclusions would be most beneficial. He never succeeded in devising such a method, but his best attempt was published in his book ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'', where he introduced his division method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Analytics and the ''Organon''====
{{main|Organon}}
What we today call ''Aristotelian logic'', Aristotle himself would have labeled &quot;analytics&quot;. The term &quot;logic&quot; he reserved to mean ''dialectics''. Most of Aristotle's work is probably not in its original form, because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers. The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into six books in about the early 1st century CE:
#''Categories''
#''On Interpretation''
#''Prior Analytics''
#''Posterior Analytics''
#''Topics''
#''On Sophistical Refutations''

The order of the books (or the teachings from which they are composed) is not certain, but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle's writings. It goes from the basics, the analysis of simple terms in the ''Categories,'' the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in ''On Interpretation'', to the study of more complex forms, namely, syllogisms (in the ''Analytics'') and dialectics (in the ''Topics'' and ''Sophistical Refutations''). The first three treatises form the core of the logical theory ''stricto sensu'': the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning. There is one volume of Aristotle's concerning logic not found in the ''Organon'', namely the fourth book of ''Metaphysics.''&lt;ref name=&quot;Bocheński, 1951&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Francesco Hayez 001.jpg|thumb|&quot;Aristotle&quot; by Francesco Hayez (1791–1882)]]

Like his teacher Plato, Aristotle's philosophy aims at the [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]]. Aristotle's [[ontology]], however, finds the universal in [[particular]] things, which he calls the essence of things, while in Plato's ontology, the universal exists apart from particular things, and is related to them as their [[prototype]] or [[wikt:exemplar|exemplar]]. For Aristotle, therefore, [[epistemology]] is based on the study of particular phenomena and rises to the knowledge of essences, while for Plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal [[Theory of Forms|Forms]] (or ideas) and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these. For Aristotle, &quot;form&quot; still refers to the unconditional basis of [[phenomena]] but is &quot;instantiated&quot; in a particular substance (see ''[[Aristotle#Universals and particulars|Universals and particulars]]'', below). In a certain sense, Aristotle's method is both [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] and [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]], while Plato's is essentially deductive from ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In Aristotle's terminology, &quot;natural philosophy&quot; is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world, and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics, biology and other natural sciences. In modern times, the scope of ''philosophy'' has become limited to more generic or abstract inquiries, such as ethics and metaphysics, in which logic plays a major role. Today's philosophy tends to exclude empirical study of the natural world by means of the [[scientific method]]. In contrast, Aristotle's philosophical endeavors encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry.

In the larger sense of the word, Aristotle makes philosophy coextensive with reasoning, which he also would describe as &quot;science&quot;. Note, however, that his use of the term ''science'' carries a different meaning than that covered by the term &quot;scientific method&quot;. For Aristotle, &quot;all science (''dianoia'') is either practical, poetical or theoretical&quot; (''Metaphysics'' 1025b25). By practical science, he means ethics and politics; by poetical science, he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts; by theoretical science, he means physics, mathematics and metaphysics.

If logic (or &quot;analytics&quot;) is regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy, the divisions of Aristotelian philosophy would consist of: (1) [[Logic]]; (2) Theoretical Philosophy, including Metaphysics, Physics and Mathematics; (3) Practical Philosophy and (4) Poetical Philosophy.

In the period between his two stays in Athens, between his times at the Academy and the Lyceum, Aristotle conducted most of the scientific thinking and research for which he is renowned today. In fact, most of Aristotle's life was devoted to the study of the objects of natural science. Aristotle's metaphysics contains observations on the nature of numbers but he made no original contributions to mathematics. He did, however, perform [[original research]] in the natural sciences, e.g., botany, zoology, physics, astronomy, chemistry, meteorology, and several other sciences.

Aristotle's writings on science are largely qualitative, as opposed to quantitative. Beginning in the 16th century, scientists began applying mathematics to the physical sciences, and Aristotle's work in this area was deemed hopelessly inadequate. His failings were largely due to the absence of concepts like mass, velocity, force and temperature. He had a conception of speed and temperature, but no quantitative understanding of them, which was partly due to the absence of basic experimental devices, like clocks and thermometers.

His writings provide an account of many scientific observations, a mixture of precocious accuracy and curious errors. For example, in his ''[[History of Animals]]'' he claimed that human males have more teeth than females.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''History of Animals'', 2.3.&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, [[John Philoponus]], and later [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], showed by simple experiments that Aristotle's theory that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philoponus/#2.2 |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=26 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Aristotle refuted [[Democritus]]'s claim that the [[Milky Way]] was made up of &quot;those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun's rays,&quot; pointing out (correctly, even if such reasoning was bound to be dismissed for a long time) that, given &quot;current astronomical demonstrations&quot; that &quot;the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun, then&amp;nbsp;... the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Meteorology'' 1.8, trans. E.W. Webster, rev. J. Barnes.&lt;/ref&gt;

In places, Aristotle goes too far in deriving 'laws of the universe' from simple observation and over-stretched [[reason]]. Today's scientific method assumes that such thinking without sufficient facts is ineffective, and that discerning the validity of one's hypothesis requires far more rigorous experimentation than that which Aristotle used to support his laws.

Aristotle also had some scientific blind spots. He posited a [[geocentrism|geocentric cosmology]] that we may discern in selections of the ''Metaphysics'', which was widely accepted up until the 16th century. From the 3rd century to the 16th century, the dominant view held that the Earth was the rotational [[History of the Center of the Universe|center of the universe]].

Because he was perhaps the philosopher most respected by European thinkers during and after the Renaissance, these thinkers often took Aristotle's erroneous positions as given, which held back science in this epoch.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Burnet (classicist)|Burent, John.]] 1928. ''Platonism'', Berkeley: University of California Press, pp. 61, 103–104.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Aristotle's scientific shortcomings should not mislead one into forgetting his great advances in the many scientific fields. For instance, he founded logic as a formal science and created foundations to biology that were not superseded for two millennia. Moreover, he introduced the fundamental notion that nature is composed of things that change and that studying such changes can provide useful knowledge of underlying constants.

===Geology===
As quoted from [[w:Charles Lyell|Charles Lyell's]] ''[[Principles of Geology]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He [Aristotle] refers to many examples of changes now constantly going on, and insists emphatically on the great results which they must produce in the lapse of ages. He instances particular cases of lakes that had dried up, and deserts that had at length become watered by rivers and fertilized. He points to the growth of the Nilotic delta since the time of Homer, to the shallowing of the [[Palus Maeotis]] within sixty years from his own time&amp;nbsp;... He alludes&amp;nbsp;... to the upheaving of one of the Eolian islands, previous to a volcanic eruption. The changes of the earth, he says, are so slow in comparison to the duration of our lives, that they are overlooked; and the migrations of people after great catastrophes, and their removal to other regions, cause the event to be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says [12th chapter of his ''Meteorics''] 'the distribution of land and sea in particular regions does not endure throughout all time, but it becomes sea in those parts where it was land, and again it becomes land where it was sea, and there is reason for thinking that these changes take place according to a certain system, and within a certain period.' The concluding observation is as follows: 'As time never fails, and the universe is eternal, neither the Tanais, nor the Nile, can have flowed for ever. The places where they rise were once dry, and there is a limit to their operations, but there is none to time. So also of all other rivers; they spring up and they perish; and the sea also continually deserts some lands and invades others The same tracts, therefore, of the earth are not some always sea, and others always continents, but every thing changes in the course of time.'&lt;ref&gt;[[wikiquote:Charles Lyell|Charles Lyell]], ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=mmIOAAAAQAAJ&amp; Principles of Geology]'', 1832, p.17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Physics===
{{main|Physics (Aristotle)}}

====Five elements====
{{main|Classical element}}
Aristotle proposed a fifth element, aether, in addition to the four proposed earlier by [[Empedocles]].
*[[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], which is cold and dry; this corresponds to the modern idea of a solid.
*[[Water (classical element)|Water]], which is cold and wet; this corresponds to the modern idea of a liquid.
*[[Air (classical element)|Air]], which is hot and wet; this corresponds to the modern idea of a gas.
*[[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], which is hot and dry; this corresponds to the modern ideas of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] and heat.
*[[Aether (classical element)|Aether]], which is the divine substance that makes up the [[Celestial spheres|heavenly spheres]] and heavenly bodies (stars and planets).

Each of the four earthly elements has its natural place. All that is earthly tends toward the center of the universe, i.e., the center of the Earth. Water tends toward a sphere surrounding the center. Air tends toward a sphere surrounding the water sphere. Fire tends toward the lunar sphere (in which the Moon orbits). When elements are moved out of their natural place, they naturally move back towards it. This is &quot;natural motion&quot;—motion requiring no extrinsic cause. So, for example, in water, earthy bodies sink while air bubbles rise up; in air, rain falls and flame rises.  Outside all the other spheres, the heavenly, fifth element, manifested in the stars and planets, moves in the perfection of circles.

====Motion====
{{main|potentiality and actuality}}
Aristotle defined [[Motion (physics)|motion]] as the actuality of a potentiality ''as such''.&lt;ref&gt;''Physics'' 201a10–11, 201a27–29, 201b4–5&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas suggested that the passage be understood literally; that motion can indeed be understood as the active fulfillment of a potential, as a transition toward a potentially possible state. Because [[Aristotle#Substance, potentiality and actuality|actuality and potentiality]] are normally opposites in Aristotle, other commentators either suggest that the wording which has come down to us is erroneous, or that the addition of the &quot;as such&quot; to the definition is critical to understanding it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Sachs|first=Joe|title=Aristotle: Motion and its Place in Nature|year=2005|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-mot/|journal=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Causality, the four causes==== &lt;!--Linked from [[Retrocausality]] and [[Physics (Aristotle)]] (see [[WP:MOS#Section management]])--&gt;
{{main|Four causes}}
Aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active causal factors:
*[[Material cause]] describes the material out of which something is composed. Thus the material cause of a table is wood, and the material cause of a car is rubber and steel. It is not about action. It does not mean one domino knocks over another domino.

*The [[formal cause]] is its form, i.e., the arrangement of that matter.  It tells us what a thing is, that any thing is determined by the definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis or archetype. It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (i.e., macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the whole-part causation. Plainly put, the formal cause is the idea existing in the first place as exemplar in the mind of the sculptor, and in the second place as intrinsic, determining cause, embodied in the matter. Formal cause could only refer to the essential quality of causation. A simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist, architect, or engineer to create his drawings.

*The [[efficient cause]] is &quot;the primary source&quot;, or that from which the change under consideration proceeds. It identifies 'what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed' and so suggests all sorts of agents, nonliving or living, acting as the sources of change or movement or rest. Representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect, this covers the modern definitions of &quot;cause&quot; as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs. So, take the two dominoes, this time of equal weighting, the first is knocked over causing the second also to fall over.

*The [[final cause]] is its purpose, or that for the sake of which a thing exists or is done, including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities. The final cause or teleos is the purpose or function that something is supposed to serve. This covers modern ideas of motivating causes, such as volition, need, desire, ethics, or spiritual beliefs.

Additionally, things can be causes of one another, causing each other reciprocally, as hard work causes fitness and vice versa, although not in the same way or function, the one is as the beginning of change, the other as the goal. (Thus Aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect). Moreover, Aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects; its presence and absence may result in different outcomes. Simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event. Our two dominoes require someone or something to intentionally knock over the first domino, because it cannot fall of its own accord.

Aristotle marked two modes of causation: proper (prior) causation and accidental (chance) causation. All causes, proper and incidental, can be spoken as potential or as actual, particular or generic. The same language refers to the effects of causes, so that generic effects assigned to generic causes, particular effects to particular causes, operating causes to actual effects. Essentially, causality does not suggest a temporal relation between the cause and the effect.

====Optics====
Aristotle held more accurate theories on some optical concepts than other philosophers of his day. The earliest known written evidence of a [[camera obscura]] can be found in Aristotle's documentation of such a device in 350 BC in ''Problemata''. Aristotle's apparatus contained a dark chamber that had a single small hole, or [[aperture]], to allow for sunlight to enter. Aristotle used the device to make observations of the sun and noted that no matter what shape the hole was, the sun would still be correctly displayed as a round object. In modern cameras, this is analogous to the [[Diaphragm (optics)|diaphragm]]. Aristotle also made the observation that when the distance between the aperture and the surface with the image increased, the image was magnified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Lahanas |url=http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Optics.htm |title=Optics and ancient Greeks |publisher=Mlahanas.de |accessdate=26 April 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090411051535/http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Optics.htm| archivedate= 11 April 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chance and spontaneity====
According to Aristotle, spontaneity and chance are causes of some things, distinguishable from other types of cause. Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of [[sumbebekos|accidental things]]. It is &quot;from what is spontaneous&quot; (but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance). For a better understanding of Aristotle's conception of &quot;chance&quot; it might be better to think of &quot;coincidence&quot;: Something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place, but with the result of another thing (not intended) taking place.

For example: A person seeks donations. That person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum. However, if the person seeking the donations met the person donating, not for the purpose of collecting donations, but for some other purpose, Aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance. It must be unusual that something happens by chance. In other words, if something happens all or most of the time, we cannot say that it is by chance.

There is also more specific kind of chance, which Aristotle names &quot;luck&quot;, that can only apply to human beings, because it is in the sphere of moral actions. According to Aristotle, luck must involve choice (and thus deliberation), and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice. &quot;What is not capable of action cannot do anything by chance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'' 2.6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metaphysics===
[[File:Uni Freiburg - Philosophen 4.jpg|thumb|Statue of Aristotle (1915) by Cipri Adolf Bermann at the [[University of Freiburg]] [[Freiburg im Breisgau|im Breisgau]]]]
{{main|Metaphysics (Aristotle)}}
Aristotle defines metaphysics as &quot;the knowledge of [[hylomorphism|immaterial]] being,&quot; or of &quot;being in the highest degree of [[abstraction]].&quot; He refers to metaphysics as &quot;first philosophy&quot;, as well as &quot;the theologic science.&quot;

====Substance, potentiality and actuality====
{{see also|Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)}}
Aristotle examines the concepts of [[Substance theory|substance]] and [[essence]] (''ousia'') in his ''Metaphysics'' (Book VII), and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form. In book VIII, he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the [[Material substratum|substratum]], or the stuff of which it is composed. For example, the matter of a house is the bricks, stones, timbers etc., or whatever constitutes the ''potential'' house, while the form of the substance is the ''actual'' house, namely 'covering for bodies and chattels' or any other [[Genus-differentia definition|differentia]] (see also [[predicables]]) that let us define something as a house. The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' VIII 1043a 10–30&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to the change (''[[Potentiality and actuality|kinesis]]'') and its causes now, as he defines in his [[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]] and [[On Generation and Corruption]] 319b–320a, he distinguishes the coming to be from:
# growth and diminution, which is change in quantity;
# locomotion, which is change in space; and
# alteration, which is change in quality.

The coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property. In that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality (''[[Dunamis|dynamis]]'') and actuality (''[[entelecheia]]'') in association with the matter and the form.

Referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing, or being acted upon, if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (''dynamei'') plant, and if is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially beings can either 'act' (''poiein'') or 'be acted upon' (''paschein''), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate&amp;nbsp;– being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise&amp;nbsp;– acting).

Actuality is the fulfillment of the end of the potentiality. Because the end (''telos'') is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end. Referring then to our previous example, we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;For that for the sake of which a thing is, is its principle, and the becoming is for the sake of the end; and the actuality is the end, and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired. For animals do not see in order that they may have sight, but they have sight that they may see.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' IX 1050a 5–10&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In summary, the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities, which is also a [[final cause]] or end. Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula, in time and in substantiality.

With this [[definition]] of the particular substance (i.e., matter and form), Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings, for example, &quot;what is it that makes a man one&quot;? Since, according to Plato there are two Ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a unity? However, according to Aristotle, the potential being (matter) and the actual one (form) are one and the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' VIII 1045a–b&lt;/ref&gt;

====Universals and particulars====
{{main|Aristotle's theory of universals}}
Aristotle's predecessor, Plato, argued that all things have a universal form, which could be either a property, or a relation to other things. When we look at an apple, for example, we see an apple, and we can also analyze a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other.

Plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things. For example, it is possible that there is no particular good in existence, but &quot;good&quot; is still a proper universal form. [[Bertrand Russell]] is a 20th-century philosopher who agreed with Plato on the existence of &quot;uninstantiated universals&quot;.

Aristotle disagreed with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated. Aristotle argued that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things. According to Aristotle, if a universal exists, either as a particular or a relation, then there must have been, must be currently, or must be in the future, something on which the universal can be predicated. Consequently, according to Aristotle, if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time, then it does not exist.

In addition, Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals. As Plato spoke of the world of the forms, a location where all universal forms subsist, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated. So, according to Aristotle, the form of apple exists within each apple, rather than in the world of the forms.

===Biology and medicine===
In Aristotelian science, especially in biology, things he saw himself have stood the test of time better than his retelling of the reports of others, which contain error and superstition. He dissected animals but not humans; his ideas on how the human body works have been almost entirely superseded.

====Empirical research program====
[[File:Octopus3.jpg|thumb|Octopus swimming]]
[[File:Torpedo fuscomaculata2.jpg|thumb|''Torpedo fuscomaculata'']]
[[File:Triakis semifasciata.jpg|thumb|Leopard shark]]
Aristotle is the earliest natural historian whose work has survived in some detail. Aristotle certainly did research on the natural history of [[Lesbos]], and the surrounding seas and neighbouring areas. The works that reflect this research, such as ''[[History of Animals]]'', ''[[Generation of Animals]]'', and ''[[Parts of Animals]]'', contain some observations and interpretations, along with sundry myths and mistakes. The most striking passages are about the sea-life visible from observation on Lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen. His observations on [[catfish]], [[Electric ray|electric fish]] (''[[Torpedo (genus)|Torpedo]]'') and angler-fish are detailed, as is his writing on [[cephalopod]]s, namely, ''Octopus'', ''Sepia'' ([[cuttlefish]]) and the paper nautilus (''[[Argonauta argo]]''). His description of the [[hectocotylus|hectocotyl arm]], used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the 19th century. He separated the aquatic mammals from fish, and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called Selachē ([[selachians]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Singer, Charles 1931&quot;&gt;Singer, Charles. ''A short history of biology''. Oxford 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another good example of his methods comes from the ''Generation of Animals'' in which Aristotle describes breaking open fertilized chicken eggs at intervals to observe when visible organs were generated.

He gave accurate descriptions of [[ruminant]]s' four-chambered fore-stomachs, and of the [[Ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]] embryological development of the [[hound shark]] ''[[Mustelus mustelus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Kearns, &quot;Animals, knowledge about,&quot; in ''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'', 3rd ed., 1996, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Classification of living things====
Aristotle's classification of living things contains some elements which still existed in the 19th century. What the modern zoologist would call vertebrates and invertebrates, Aristotle called 'animals with blood' and 'animals without blood' (he did not know that complex invertebrates do make use of [[hemoglobin]], but of a different kind from vertebrates). Animals with blood were divided into live-bearing (humans and mammals), and egg-bearing (birds and fish). Invertebrates ('animals without blood') are insects, crustacea (divided into non-shelled – cephalopods – and shelled) and testacea (molluscs). In some respects, this incomplete classification is better than that of [[Linnaeus]], who crowded the invertebrata together into two groups, Insecta and Vermes (worms).

For [[Charles Singer]], &quot;Nothing is more remarkable than [Aristotle's] efforts to [exhibit] the relationships of living things as a ''scala naturae''&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Singer, Charles 1931&quot;/&gt; Aristotle's ''History of Animals'' classified organisms in relation to a hierarchical &quot;[[Great chain of being|Ladder of Life]]&quot; (''scala naturae''  or [[Great Chain of Being]]), placing them according to complexity of structure and function so that higher organisms showed greater vitality and ability to move.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, of course, is not responsible for the later use made of this idea by clerics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle believed that intellectual purposes, i.e., [[final cause]]s, guided all natural processes. Such a [[teleological]] view gave Aristotle cause to justify his observed data as an expression of formal design. Noting that &quot;no animal has, at the same time, both tusks and horns,&quot; and &quot;a single-hooved animal with two horns I have never seen,&quot; Aristotle suggested that Nature, giving no animal both horns and tusks, was staving off vanity, and giving creatures faculties only to such a degree as they are necessary. Noting that ruminants had multiple stomachs and weak teeth, he supposed the first was to compensate for the latter, with Nature trying to preserve a type of balance.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'' pp 43–44&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar fashion, Aristotle believed that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from plants on up to man, the ''scala naturae''.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 201–202; see also: Lovejoy, ''The Great Chain of Being''&lt;/ref&gt; His system had eleven grades, arranged according &quot;to the degree to which they are infected with potentiality&quot;, expressed in their form at birth. The highest animals laid warm and wet creatures alive, the lowest bore theirs cold, dry, and in thick eggs.

Aristotle also held that the level of a creature's perfection was reflected in its form, but not preordained by that form. Ideas like this, and his ideas about souls, are not regarded as science at all in modern times.

He placed emphasis on the type(s) of soul an organism possessed, asserting that plants possess a vegetative soul, responsible for reproduction and growth, animals a vegetative and a sensitive soul, responsible for mobility and sensation, and humans a vegetative, a sensitive, and a rational soul, capable of thought and reflection.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''De Anima'' II 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle, in contrast to earlier philosophers, but in accordance with the Egyptians, placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'' pp 45&lt;/ref&gt; Notable is Aristotle's division of sensation and thought, which generally went against previous philosophers, with the exception of [[Alcmaeon of Croton|Alcmaeon]].&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, ''A History of Greek Philosophy'' Vol. 1 pp. 348&lt;/ref&gt;

====Successor: Theophrastus====
[[File:161Theophrastus 161 frontespizio.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] to a 1644 version of the expanded and illustrated edition of ''[[Historia Plantarum]]'' (ca. 1200), which was originally written around 200 BC.]]
{{main|Theophrastus|Historia Plantarum}}
Aristotle's successor at the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]], [[Theophrastus]], wrote a series of books on botany—the ''History of Plants''—which survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to botany, even into the [[Middle Ages]]. Many of Theophrastus' names survive into modern times, such as ''carpos'' for fruit, and ''pericarpion'' for seed vessel.

Rather than focus on formal causes, as Aristotle did, Theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme, drawing analogies between natural and artificial processes, and relying on Aristotle's concept of the [[efficient cause]]. Theophrastus also recognized the role of sex in the reproduction of some higher plants, though this last discovery was lost in later ages.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 90–91; Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'', p 46&lt;/ref&gt;

====Influence on Hellenistic medicine====
{{details|Medicine in ancient Greece}}
After Theophrastus, the Lyceum failed to produce any original work. Though interest in Aristotle's ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly.&lt;ref&gt;Annas, ''Classical Greek Philosophy'' pp 252&lt;/ref&gt; It is not until the age of [[Alexandria]] under the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]] that advances in biology can be again found.

The first medical teacher at Alexandria, [[Herophilos|Herophilus of Chalcedon]], corrected Aristotle, placing intelligence in the brain, and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation. Herophilus also distinguished between [[vein]]s and [[artery|arteries]], noting that the latter [[pulse]] while the former do not.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'' pp 56&lt;/ref&gt; Though a few ancient [[atomism|atomists]] such as [[Lucretius]] challenged the [[teleology|teleological]] viewpoint of Aristotelian ideas about life, teleology (and after the rise of Christianity, [[natural theology]]) would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries. [[Ernst Mayr]] claimed that there was &quot;nothing of any real consequence in biology after Lucretius and Galen until the Renaissance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 90–94; quotation from p 91&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's ideas of natural history and medicine survived, but they were generally taken unquestioningly.&lt;ref&gt;Annas, ''Classical Greek Philosophy'', p 252&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychology===
Aristotle's [[psychology]], given in his treatise [[On the Soul]] (''peri psyche'', often known by its [[Latin]] title ''De Anima''), posits three kinds of [[soul]] (&quot;psyches&quot;): the vegetative soul, the sensitive soul, and the rational soul. Humans have a rational soul. This kind of soul is capable of the same powers as the other kinds: Like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself; like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally. The unique part of the human, rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and compare them.

For Aristotle, the soul (''psyche'') was a simpler concept than it is for us today. By soul he simply meant the [[Hylomorphism#Body–soul hylomorphism|form]] of a living being. Because all beings are composites of form and matter, the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings, e.g. the ability to initiate movement (or in the case of plants, growth and chemical transformations, which Aristotle considers types of movement).&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, article [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-psychology/ &quot;Psychology&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Practical philosophy===

====Ethics====
{{main|Aristotelian ethics}}
Aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study, i.e., one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake. He wrote several treatises on ethics, including most notably, the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''.

Aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function (''ergon'') of a thing. An eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see, because the proper function of an eye is sight. Aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans, and that this function must be an activity of the ''[[De Anima|psuchē]]'' (normally translated as ''soul'') in accordance with reason (''[[logos]]''). Aristotle identified such an optimum activity of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action, ''[[eudaimonia]]'', generally translated as &quot;happiness&quot; or sometimes &quot;well being&quot;. To have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character (''ēthikē'' ''[[aretē]]''), often translated as moral (or ethical) virtue (or excellence).&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicomachean Ethics]] Book I. See for example chapter 7 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1098a 1098a].&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately, but by teachers, and experience, leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things. When the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom (''[[phronesis]]'') and their intellect (''[[nous]]'') can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue, the wisdom of an accomplished [[theory|theoretical]] or speculative thinker, or in other words, a philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicomachean Ethics]] Book VI.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Politics====
{{main|Politics (Aristotle)}}
{{quote
 | ''Like Aristotle, conservatives generally accept the world as it is; they distrust the politics of abstract reason{{spaced ndash}}that is, reason divorced from experience.''

}}
In addition to his works on ethics, which address the individual, Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]''. Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community. Moreover, he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual, &quot;for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Politics 1253a19–24&lt;/ref&gt; He also famously stated that &quot;man is by nature a political animal&quot;. Aristotle conceived of politics as being like an [[organism]] rather than like a machine, and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others. Aristotle's conception of the city is organic, and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Ebenstein | first =Alan | coauthors =William Ebenstein | title =Introduction to Political Thinkers | publisher =Wadsworth Group | year =2002 | page =59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from Aristotle's understanding. Although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires, the natural community according to Aristotle was the city (''[[polis]]'') which functions as a political &quot;community&quot; or &quot;partnership&quot; (''koinōnia'')&lt;!-- (1252a1) --&gt;. The aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability&lt;!-- (1280b29–31) --&gt;, but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life, and to perform beautiful acts: &quot;The political partnership must be regarded, therefore, as being for the sake of noble actions, not for the sake of living together&lt;!-- (1281a1–3) --&gt;.&quot; This is distinguished from modern approaches, beginning with [[social contract]] theory, according to which individuals leave the [[state of nature]] because of &quot;fear of violent death&quot; or its &quot;inconveniences.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;For a different reading of social and economic processes in the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' and ''Politics'' see Polanyi, K. (1957) &quot;Aristotle Discovers the Economy&quot; in ''Primitive, Archaic and Modern Economies: Essays of Karl Polanyi'' ed. G. Dalton, Boston 1971, 78–115&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rhetoric and poetics====
{{main|Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Poetics (Aristotle)}}
Aristotle considered [[epic poetry]], tragedy, comedy, [[Dithyramb|dithyrambic poetry]] and music to be [[Mimesis|imitative]], each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' I 1447a&lt;/ref&gt; For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation – through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' III&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' IV&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is believed that Aristotle's ''Poetics'' comprised two books – one on comedy and one on tragedy – only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived. Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, thought, spectacle, and lyric poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' VI&lt;/ref&gt; The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy. Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the [[catharsis]] of those same emotions. Aristotle concludes ''Poetics'' with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic [[mimesis]]. He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' XXVI&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles, folklore, and proverbs; he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]] and studied the fables of [[Aesop]].&lt;ref&gt;Temple, Olivia, and Temple, Robert (translators), [http://books.google.com/books?id=ZB-rVxPvtPEC&amp;pg=PR3&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=0_0 The Complete Fables By Aesop] Penguin Classics, 1998. ISBN 0-14-044649-4 Cf. Introduction, pp. xi–xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on women===
{{main|Aristotle's views on women}}
Aristotle's analysis of procreation describes an active, ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert, passive female element. On this ground, feminists have accused Aristotle of [[misogyny]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Freeland&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Feminist Interpretations of Aristotle | publisher=Penn State University Press | author=Freeland, Cynthia A. | year=1998 | isbn=0-271-01730-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sexism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Morsink&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/4330727 | title=Was Aristotle's Biology Sexist? | author=Morsink, Johannes | journal=Journal of the History of Biology |date=Spring 1979 | volume=12 | issue=1 | pages=83–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Aristotle gave equal weight to women's happiness as he did to men's, and commented in his ''Rhetoric'' that a society cannot be happy unless women are happy too.

==Loss and preservation of his works==
{{see also|Corpus Aristotelicum}}
Modern scholarship reveals that Aristotle's &quot;lost&quot; works stray considerably in characterization&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornell&quot;&gt;Terence Irwin and Gail Fine, [[Cornell University]], ''Aristotle: Introductory Readings.'' Indianapolis, Indiana: Hackett Publishing Company, Inc. (1996), Introduction, pp. xi–xii.&lt;/ref&gt; from the surviving Aristotelian corpus. Whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with an intent for subsequent publication, the surviving works do not appear to have been so.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornell&quot; /&gt; Rather the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes unintended for publication.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornell&quot; /&gt; The authenticity of a portion of the surviving works as originally Aristotelian is also today held suspect, with some books duplicating or summarizing each other, the authorship of one book questioned and another book considered to be unlikely Aristotle's at all.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornell&quot; /&gt;

Some of the individual works within the corpus, including the ''[[Constitution of Athens]],'' are regarded by most scholars as products of Aristotle's &quot;school,&quot; perhaps compiled under his direction or supervision. Others, such as ''On Colors,'' may have been produced by Aristotle's successors at the Lyceum, e.g., [[Theophrastus]] and [[Strato of Lampsacus|Straton]]. Still others acquired Aristotle's name through similarities in doctrine or content, such as the ''De Plantis,'' possibly by [[Nicolaus of Damascus]]. Other works in the corpus include medieval palmistries and [[astrological]] and [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] texts whose connections to Aristotle are purely fanciful and self-promotional.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Thorndike, &quot;Chiromancy in Medieval Latin Manuscripts,&quot; ''Speculum'' 40 (1965), pp. 674–706; Roger A. Pack, &quot;Pseudo-Arisoteles: Chiromantia,&quot; ''Archives d'histoire doctrinale et littéraire du Moyen Âge'' 39 (1972), pp. 289–320; Pack, &quot;A Pseudo-Aristotelian Chiromancy,&quot; ''Archives d'histoire doctrinale et littéraire du Moyen Âge'' 36 (1969), pp. 189–241.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a distinction that originates with Aristotle himself, his writings are divisible into two groups: the &quot;[[exoteric]]&quot; and the &quot;[[esoteric]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Barnes]], &quot;Life and Work&quot; in ''The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle'' (1995), p. 12; Aristotle himself: ''Nicomachean Ethics'' 1102a26–27. Aristotle himself never uses the term &quot;esoteric&quot; or &quot;acroamatic&quot;. For other passages where Aristotle speaks of ''exōterikoi logoi'', see [[W. D. Ross]], ''Aristotle's Metaphysics'' (1953), vol. 2, pp. 408–410. Ross defends an interpretation according to which the phrase, at least in Aristotle's own works, usually refers generally to &quot;discussions not peculiar to the [[Peripatetic school]]&quot;, rather than to specific works of Aristotle's own.&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars have understood this as a distinction between works Aristotle intended for the public (exoteric), and the more technical works intended for use within the school (esoteric). Modern scholars commonly assume these latter to be Aristotle's own (unpolished) lecture notes (or in some cases possible notes by his students).&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes, Life and Work, p. 12&quot;&gt;Barnes, &quot;Life and Work&quot;, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; However, one classic scholar offers an alternative interpretation.  The 5th century [[neoplatonist]] [[Ammonius Hermiae]] writes that Aristotle's writing style is deliberately [[Obscurantism|obscurantist]] so that &quot;good people may for that reason stretch their mind even more, whereas empty minds that are lost through carelessness will be put to flight by the obscurity when they encounter sentences like these.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}} p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common assumption is that none of the exoteric works is extant – that all of Aristotle's extant writings are of the esoteric kind. Current knowledge of what exactly the exoteric writings were like is scant and dubious, though many of them may have been in dialogue form. (''Fragments'' of some of Aristotle's dialogues have survived.) Perhaps it is to these that [[Cicero]] refers when he characterized Aristotle's writing style as &quot;a river of gold&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

One major question in the history of Aristotle's works, then, is how were the exoteric writings all lost, and how did the ones we now possess come to us&lt;ref&gt;.The definitive, English study of these questions is Barnes, &quot;Roman Aristotle&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The story of the original manuscripts of the esoteric treatises is described by [[Strabo]] in his ''Geography'' and [[Plutarch]] in his ''[[Parallel Lives]]''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Sulla.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscripts were left from Aristotle to his successor Theophrastus, who in turn willed them to [[Neleus of Scepsis]]. Neleus supposedly took the writings from Athens to [[Scepsis]], where his heirs let them languish in a cellar until the 1st century BC, when [[Apellicon of Teos]] discovered and purchased the manuscripts, bringing them back to Athens. According to the story, Apellicon tried to repair some of the damage that was done during the manuscripts' stay in the basement, introducing a number of errors into the text. When [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] occupied Athens in 86 BC, he carried off the library of Apellicon to Rome, where they were first published in 60 BC by the grammarian [[Tyrannion of Amisus]] and then by the philosopher [[Andronicus of Rhodes]].&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Rome: from the early Republic to the assassination of Julius Caesar – Page 513, Matthew Dillon, Lynda Garland&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia Americana, Volume 22 – Page 131, Grolier Incorporated – Juvenile Nonfiction&lt;/ref&gt;

Carnes Lord attributes the popular belief in this story to the fact that it provides &quot;the most plausible explanation for the rapid eclipse of the Peripatetic school after the middle of the third century, and for the absence of widespread knowledge of the specialized treatises of Aristotle throughout the Hellenistic period, as well as for the sudden reappearance of a flourishing Aristotelianism during the first century B.C.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |last=Lord
 |first=Carnes
 |title=Introduction to the Politics, by Aristotle

 |year=1984
 |location=Chicago
 |page=11
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord voices a number of reservations concerning this story, however. First, the condition of the texts is far too good for them to have suffered considerable damage followed by Apellicon's inexpert attempt at repair.

Second, there is &quot;incontrovertible evidence,&quot; Lord says, that the treatises were in circulation during the time in which Strabo and Plutarch suggest they were confined within the cellar in Scepsis. Third, the definitive edition of Aristotle's texts seems to have been made in Athens some fifty years before Andronicus supposedly compiled his. And fourth, ancient library catalogues predating Andronicus' intervention list an Aristotelian corpus quite similar to the one we currently possess. Lord sees a number of post-Aristotelian interpolations in the ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', for example, but is generally confident that the work has come down to us relatively intact.

On the one hand, the surviving texts of Aristotle do not derive from finished literary texts, but rather from working drafts used within Aristotle's school, as opposed, on the other hand, to the [[Corpus Aristotelicum#Fragments|dialogues and other &quot;exoteric&quot; texts]] which Aristotle published more widely during his lifetime. The consensus is that Andronicus of Rhodes collected the esoteric works of Aristotle's school which existed in the form of smaller, separate works, distinguished them from those of Theophrastus and other Peripatetics, edited them, and finally compiled them into the more cohesive, larger works as they are known today.&lt;ref&gt;Anagnostopoulos, G., &quot;Aristotle's Works and Thoughts&quot;, ''A Companion to Aristotle'' (Blackwell Publishing, 2009), p. 16.  See also, Barnes, J., &quot;Life and Work&quot;, ''The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle'' (Cambridge University Press, 1995), pp.&amp;nbsp;10–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
[[File:Aristotle with a Bust of Homer.jpg|thumb|Aristotle with a bust of [[Homer]], by [[Rembrandt]].]]

More than 2300 years after his death, Aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived. He contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence, and he was the founder of many new fields. According to the philosopher [[Bryan Magee]], &quot;it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Magee |first=Bryan |authorlink=Bryan Magee |title=The Story of Philosophy |year=2010 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |page= 34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among countless other achievements, Aristotle was the founder of [[formal logic]],&lt;ref&gt;W. K. C. Guthrie (1990). &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=8EG0yV0cGoEC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false A history of Greek philosophy: Aristotle : an encounter]''&quot;. [[Cambridge University Press]]. p.156. ISBN 0-521-38760-4&lt;/ref&gt; pioneered the study of [[zoology]], and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/34560/Aristotle |title=Aristotle (Greek philosopher) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=26 April 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090422103155/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/34560/Aristotle| archivedate= 22 April 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Durant |first=Will |authorlink=Will Durant |title=[[The Story of Philosophy]] |year=1926 (2006) |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. |location=United States |isbn=978-0-671-73916-4 |page= 92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these achievements, the influence of Aristotle's errors is considered by some to have held back science considerably. [[Bertrand Russell]] notes that &quot;almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some Aristotelian doctrine&quot;. Russell also refers to Aristotle's ethics as &quot;repulsive&quot;, and calls his logic &quot;as definitely antiquated as Ptolemaic astronomy&quot;. Russell notes that these errors make it difficult to do historical justice to Aristotle, until one remembers how large of an advance he made upon all of his predecessors.&lt;ref name=&quot;philosophy1972&quot;/&gt;

===Later Greek philosophers===
The immediate influence of Aristotle's work was felt as the Lyceum grew into the [[Peripatetic school]]. Aristotle's notable students included [[Aristoxenus]], [[Dicaearchus]], [[Demetrius of Phalerum]], [[Eudemos of Rhodes]], [[Harpalus]], [[Hephaestion]], [[Meno]], [[Mnason of Phocis]], [[Nicomachus (son of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]], and [[Theophrastus]]. Aristotle's influence over Alexander the Great is seen in the latter's bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists, botanists, and researchers. He had also learned a great deal about Persian customs and traditions from his teacher. Although his respect for Aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of Aristotle's geography was clearly wrong, when the old philosopher released his works to the public, Alexander complained &quot;Thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines; for in what shall I surpass other men if those doctrines wherein I have been trained are to be all men's common property?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Alexander''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on Byzantine scholars===
Greek Christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of Aristotle by copying all the extant Greek language manuscripts of the corpus. The first Greek Christians to comment extensively on Aristotle were [[John Philoponus]], Elias, and David in the sixth century, and [[Stephen of Alexandria]] in the early seventh century.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sorabji, ed. ''Aristotle Transformed'' London, 1990, 20, 28, 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Philoponus]] stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of Aristotle's views on the eternity of the world, movement, and other elements of Aristotelian thought.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sorabji, ed. ''Aristotle Transformed'' (London, 1990) 233–274.&lt;/ref&gt; After a hiatus of several centuries, formal commentary by Eustratius and [[Michael of Ephesus]] reappears in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries, apparently sponsored by [[Anna Comnena]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sorabji, ed. ''Aristotle Transformed'' (London, 1990) 20–21; 28–29, 393–406; 407–408.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on Islamic theologians===
Aristotle was one of the most revered Western thinkers in early [[Islamic theology]]. Most of the still extant works of Aristotle,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', ''Aristutalis''&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a number of the original Greek commentaries, were translated into Arabic and studied by [[Muslim]] philosophers, scientists and scholars.  [[Averroes]], [[Avicenna]] and [[Alpharabius]], who wrote on Aristotle in great depth, also influenced [[Thomas Aquinas]] and other Western Christian scholastic philosophers. [[Alkindus]] considered Aristotle as the outstanding and unique representative of philosophy&lt;ref&gt;''Rasa'il'' I, 103, 17, Abu Rida&lt;/ref&gt; and Averroes spoke of Aristotle as the &quot;exemplar&quot; for all future philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;''Comm. Magnum'' in Aristotle'', ''De Anima'', III, 2, 43 Crawford&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval Muslim scholars regularly described Aristotle as the &quot;First Teacher&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''al-mua'llim al-thani'', ''Aristutalis''&lt;/ref&gt; The title &quot;teacher&quot; was first given to Aristotle by Muslim scholars, and was later used by Western philosophers (as in the famous poem of Dante) who were influenced by the tradition of [[Islamic philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nasr|first=Seyyed Hossein|title=The Islamic Intellectual Tradition in Persia|year=1996|publisher=Curzon Press|isbn=0-7007-0314-4|pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with the [[Greeks|Greek]] theorists, the Muslims considered Aristotle to be a dogmatic philosopher, the author of a closed system, and believed that Aristotle shared with [[Plato]] essential tenets of thought. Some went so far as to credit Aristotle himself with neo-Platonic metaphysical ideas.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

===Influence on Western Christian theologians===
With the loss of the study of ancient Greek in the early medieval Latin West, Aristotle was practically unknown there from c. CE 600 to c. 1100 except through the Latin translation of the ''Organon'' made by [[Boethius]]. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, interest in Aristotle revived and Latin Christians had translations made, both from Arabic translations, such as those by [[Gerard of Cremona]],&lt;ref&gt;{{SEP|arabic-islamic-influence|Influence of Arabic and Islamic Philosophy on the Latin West}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from the original Greek, such as those by [[James of Venice]] and [[William of Moerbeke]].

After [[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote his theology, working from Moerbeke's translations, the demand for Aristotle's writings grew and the [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts returned to the West, stimulating a revival of Aristotelianism in Europe that continued into the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{SEP|aristotelianism-renaissance|Aristotelianism in the Renaissance}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Aristotle is referred to as &quot;The Philosopher&quot; by [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] thinkers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]]. See ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', Part I, Question 3, etc. These thinkers blended Aristotelian philosophy with Christianity, bringing the thought of Ancient Greece into the Middle Ages. It required a repudiation of some Aristotelian principles for the sciences and the arts to free themselves for the discovery of modern scientific laws and empirical methods. The medieval English poet [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] describes his student as being happy by having
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'' at his beddes heed''
:''Twenty bookes, clad in blak or reed,''
:''Of aristotle and his philosophie,''&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Chaucer, ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', Prologue, lines 295–295&lt;/ref&gt;
The Italian poet [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] says of Aristotle in [[The Divine Comedy|the first circles of hell]],
:''I saw the Master there of those who know,''
:''Amid the philosophic family,''
:''By all admired, and by all reverenced;''
:''There Plato too I saw, and Socrates,''
:''Who stood beside him closer than the rest.''&lt;ref&gt;''vidi 'l maestro di color che sanno''
''seder tra filosofica famiglia.''&lt;br&gt;
''Tutti lo miran, tutti onor li fanno'':&lt;br&gt;
''quivi vid'ïo Socrate e Platone''&lt;br&gt;
''che 'nnanzi a li altri più presso li stanno;''&lt;br&gt; Dante, ''L'Inferno'' (Hell), Canto IV. Lines 131–135&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Enlightenment thinkers===
The German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from Aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;Durant, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; However implausible this is, it is certainly the case that Aristotle's rigid separation of action from production, and his justification of the subservience of slaves and others to the virtue – or ''arete'' – of a few justified the ideal of aristocracy. It is [[Martin Heidegger]], not Nietzsche, who elaborated a new interpretation of Aristotle, intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition. [[Ayn Rand]] accredited Aristotle as &quot;the greatest philosopher in history&quot; and cited him as a major influence on her thinking. More recently, [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] has attempted to reform what he calls the Aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti-elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and Nietzscheans.&lt;ref&gt;Kelvin Knight, ''Aristotelian Philosophy'', Polity Press, 2007, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== List of works ==
{{main|Corpus Aristotelicum}}

The works of Aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the Corpus Aristotelicum. These texts, as opposed to Aristotle's lost works, are technical philosophical treatises from within Aristotle's school. Reference to them is made according to the organization of [[Immanuel Bekker]]'s Royal Prussian Academy edition (''Aristotelis Opera edidit Academia Regia Borussica'', Berlin, 1831–1870), which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works.

[[File:George Gershwin An American in Paris.png|thumb|A theme from George Gershwin's orchestral composition ''An American in Paris'']]
'''''An American in Paris''''' is a [[symphony|symphonic]] [[tone poem]] by the American composer [[George Gershwin]], written in 1928. Inspired by the time Gershwin had spent in Paris, it evokes the sights and energy of the French capital in the 1920s and is one of his best-known compositions.

Gershwin composed ''An American in Paris'' on commission from the [[New York Philharmonic]]. He scored the piece for the standard instruments of the [[symphony orchestra]] plus [[celesta]], [[saxophone]]s, and automobile horns. He brought back some Parisian taxi horns for the New York premiere of the composition, which took place on December&amp;nbsp;13, 1928 in [[Carnegie Hall]], with [[Walter Damrosch]] conducting the [[New York Symphony]]. Gershwin completed the orchestration on November 18, less than four weeks before the work's premiere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/?fuseaction=composition&amp;composition_id=2983 | title = An American in Paris: About the Work | publisher = [[The Kennedy Center]] | author = Richard Freed | accessdate = 5 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gershwin collaborated on the original program notes with the critic and composer [[Deems Taylor]], noting that: &quot;My purpose here is to portray the impression of an American visitor in Paris as he strolls about the city and listens to various street noises and absorbs the French atmosphere.&quot; When the tone poem moves into the [[blues]], &quot;our American friend ... has succumbed to a spasm of homesickness.&quot; But, &quot;nostalgia is not a fatal disease.&quot; The American visitor &quot;once again is an alert spectator of Parisian life&quot; and &quot;the street noises and French atmosphere are triumphant.&quot;

==Background==
[[Maurice Ravel]] met Gershwin in New York during Ravel's tour of the United States. In that meeting, Gershwin asked Ravel to be his teacher, to which Ravel responded that it was better to be a first-rate Gershwin than a second-rate Ravel. Instead, Ravel recommended that Gershwin see [[Nadia Boulanger]] in Paris. Ravel's high praise of Gershwin in an introductory letter to Boulanger caused Gershwin to seriously consider taking time to study abroad in Paris.

Gershwin arrived in Paris in March 1928. Paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers: among them [[Ezra Pound]], [[W. B. Yeats]], [[Ernest Hemingway]]; and artist [[Pablo Picasso]]. Gershwin met with Boulanger and at her request he played ten minutes of his music. Boulanger replied that she had nothing to teach him. This did not set Gershwin back, as his real intent abroad was to complete a new work based on Paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]''.

==Composition==
Gershwin based ''An American in Paris'' on a melodic fragment called &quot;Very Parisienne&quot;, written in 1926 on his first visit to Paris as a gift to his hosts, Robert and Mabel Schirmer. He described the piece as a &quot;rhapsodic ballet&quot; because it was written freely and is more modern than his previous works. Gershwin explained in ''[[Musical America]]'', &quot;My purpose here is to portray the impressions of an American visitor in Paris as he strolls about the city, listens to the various street noises, and absorbs the French atmosphere.&quot;

The piece is structured into five sections, which culminate in a loose [[Ternary form|ABA format]]. Gershwin's first A episode introduces the two main &quot;walking&quot; themes in the &quot;Allegretto grazioso&quot; and develops a third theme in the &quot;Subito con brio&quot;. The style of this A section is written in the typical French style of composers [[Claude Debussy]] and [[Les Six]]. This A section featured duple meter, singsong rhythms, and diatonic melodies with the sounds of oboe, English horn, and taxi horns. The B section's &quot;Andante ma con ritmo deciso&quot; introduces the American [[Blues]] and spasms of homesickness. The &quot;Allegro&quot; that follows continues to express homesickness in a faster [[twelve-bar blues]]. In the B section, Gershwin uses common time, syncopated rhythms, and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet, saxophone, and snare drum. &quot;Moderato con grazia&quot; is the last A section that returns to the themes set in A. After recapitulating the &quot;walking&quot; themes, Gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section B in the final “Grandioso.”

==Instrumentation==
''An American in Paris'' is scored for 3 [[flute]]s (3rd doubling on [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s, [[English horn]], 2 [[clarinet]]s in B flat, [[bass clarinet]] in B flat, 2 [[bassoon]]s, 4 [[Horn (instrument)|horn]]s in F, 3 trumpets in B flat, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[snare drum]], [[bass drum]], triangle, wood block, [[cymbal]]s, low and high [[Tom-tom drum|tom-tom]]s, [[xylophone]], [[glockenspiel]], [[celesta]], 4 [[vehicle horn|taxi horns]] labeled as A, B, C and D, [[alto saxophone]]/[[soprano saxophone]], [[tenor saxophone]]/soprano saxophone/alto saxophone, [[baritone saxophone]]/soprano saxophone/alto saxophone, and [[String section|strings]].

The revised edition by F. Campbell-Watson calls for three saxophones, alto, tenor and baritone. In this arrangement the soprano and alto doublings have been rewritten to avoid changing instruments.

[[William Merrigan Daly|William Daly]] arranged the score for piano solo which was published by New World Music in 1929.

==Response==
Gershwin did not particularly like Walter Damrosch's interpretation at the world premiere of ''An American in Paris''. He stated that Damrosch's sluggish, dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work. The audience, according to Edward Cushing, responded with &quot;a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music, good and bad, ordinarily arouses.&quot; Critics believed that ''An American in Paris'' was better crafted than his lukewarm [[Concerto in F (Gershwin)|Concerto in F]]. Some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers [[César Franck]], [[Richard Wagner]], or [[Guillaume Lekeu]] on its premiere. Gershwin responded to the critics, &quot;It's not a Beethoven Symphony, you know… It's a humorous piece, nothing solemn about it. It's not intended to draw tears. If it pleases symphony audiences as a light, jolly piece, a series of impressions musically expressed, it succeeds.&quot;

==Recordings==
[[File:American in Paris.tif|thumb|First recording]]
''An American in Paris'' has been frequently recorded.  The first recording was made for [[RCA Victor]] in 1929 with [[Nathaniel Shilkret]] conducting the Victor Symphony Orchestra, drawn from members of the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]].  Gershwin was on hand to &quot;supervise&quot; the recording; however, Shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio.  Then, a little later, Shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief [[celesta]] solo during the slow section, so he hastily asked Gershwin if he might play the solo; Gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording. The radio broadcast of the September&amp;nbsp;8, 1937 Hollywood Bowl George Gershwin Memorial Concert, in which ''An American in Paris,'' also conducted by Shilkret, was second on the program, was recorded and was released in 1998 in a two-CD set.  [[Arthur Fiedler]] and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] recorded the work for RCA Victor, including one of the first stereo recordings of the music.  In 1945, [[Arturo Toscanini]] and the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]] recorded the music in [[Carnegie Hall]], one of the few commercial recordings Toscanini made of music by an American composer. The Seattle Symphony also recorded a version in the 1980s of Gershwin's original score, before he made numerous edits resulting in the score as we hear it today.

==Use in film==
In 1951, MGM released the musical ''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]'', featuring [[Gene Kelly]] and [[Leslie Caron]].  Winning the 1951 Best Picture Oscar and numerous other awards, the film was directed by [[Vincente Minnelli]], featured many tunes of Gershwin, and concluded with an extensive, elaborate dance sequence built around the ''An American in Paris'' symphonic poem (arranged for the film by [[Johnny Green]]), costing $500,000.

A part of the symphonic composition is also featured in ''[[As Good as It Gets]]'', released in 1997.

The [[Academy Award]]s are the oldest awards ceremony for achievements in motion pictures. The '''Academy Award for Best Production Design''' recognizes achievement in [[art director#Film|art direction]] on a film. The category's original name was '''Best Art Direction''', but was changed to its current name in 2012 for the 85th Academy Awards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Music Rules&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2012/20120830.html |title=Music Rules Approved for 85th Academy Awards |accessdate=2012-08-31 |work=oscars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This change resulted from the Art Director's branch of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|Academy]] being renamed the Designer's branch. Since 1947, the award is shared with the Set Decorator(s). 

The films below are listed with their production year (for example, the 2000 Academy Award for Best Art Direction is given to a film from 1999). In the lists below, the winner of the award for each year is shown first, followed by the other nominees.

The '''Academy Awards''', commonly known as '''The Oscars''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pond|first=Steve|title=AMPAS Drops '85th Academy Awards' - Now It's Just 'The Oscars'|url=http://www.thewrap.com/awards/column-post/ampas-drops-85th-academy-awards-now-its-just-oscars-78211|accessdate=22 February 2013|newspaper=The Wrap|date=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an annual American awards ceremony honoring achievements in the [[film industry]]. Winners are awarded the statuette, officially the '''Academy Award of Merit,''' that is much better known by its nickname Oscar. The awards, first presented in 1929 at the [[Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]], are overseen by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/index.html |title = About the Academy Awards |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate = 13 April 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070407234926/http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/index.html |archivedate = 7 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,273341,00.html | title=The Birth of Oscar | first=Andrew | last=Essex | work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=14 May 1999 | accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The awards ceremony was first televised in 1953 and is now seen live in more than 200 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Academy Awards|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/about/history.html|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Oscars is also the oldest entertainment awards ceremony; its equivalents, the [[Emmy Awards]] for television, the [[Tony Awards]] for theatre, and the [[Grammy Awards]] for music and recording, are modeled after the Academy Awards.

The [[86th Academy Awards]] ceremony was held on March 2, 2014, at the [[Dolby Theatre]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 Oscars show moves to March to avoid Winter Olympics clash|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/sns-rt-film-oscars2014l2n0ch1d5-20130325,0,4480470.story|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:FONTAINE-COOPER.jpg|thumb|[[Gary Cooper]] and [[Joan Fontaine]] holding their Oscars at the Academy Awards, 1942]]
The [[first Academy Awards]] were presented on May 16, 1929, at a private dinner at the  [[Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]] with an audience of about 270 people. The post Academy Awards party was held at the Mayfair Hotel.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/about/history.html|title=History of the Academy Awards|work=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of guest tickets for that night's ceremony was $5. Fifteen statuettes were awarded, honoring artists, directors and other personalities of the film-making industry of the time for their works during the 1927–28 period; the ceremony ran for 15 minutes.

Winners had been announced to media three months earlier; however, that was changed in the second ceremony of the Academy Awards in 1930. Since then and during the first decade, the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11:00&amp;nbsp;pm on the night of the awards.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; This method was used until the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' announced the winners before the ceremony began; as a result, the Academy has since 1941 used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

The first Best Actor awarded was [[Emil Jannings]], for his performances in ''[[The Last Command (1928 film)|The Last Command]]'' and ''[[The Way of All Flesh (film)|The Way of All Flesh]]''. He had to return to Europe before the ceremony, so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history. The honored professionals were awarded for all the work done in a certain category for the qualifying period; for example, Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period and [[Janet Gaynor]] later won a single Oscar for performances in three films. Since the fourth ceremony, the system changed, and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film. For the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years.

Many movie historians{{who|date=March 2014}} believe that ''High Noon'' lost out for the 1952 Best Picture Award to ''The Greatest Show on Earth'' because the initial release of ''High Noon'' bared a panoramic view of modern downtown Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Wiley, Mason, Bona, Damien (1987). Inside Oscar: The Unofficial History of the Academy Awards. Burns &amp; Oates. ISBN 0-345-34453-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 29th ceremony, held on March 27, 1957, the [[Best Foreign Language Film]] category was introduced. Until then, foreign-language films were honored with the Special Achievement Award.

{{As of|2011|alt=As of the 83rd Academy Awards ceremony held in 2011}}, a total of 2,894 Oscars have been given for 1,853 awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/about/awards/oscar.html|title= A Brief History of the Oscar|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate = 23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oscar statuette ==

=== Design ===

Although there are seven other types of annual awards presented by the Academy (the [[Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award]], the [[Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award]], the [[Gordon E. Sawyer Award]], the [[Academy Scientific and Technical Award]], the [[Academy Award for Technical Achievement]], the [[John A. Bonner Medal of Commendation]], and the [[Student Academy Award]]) plus two awards that are not presented annually (the Special Achievement Award in the form of an Oscar statuette and the Honorary Award that may or may not be in the form of an Oscar statuette), the best known one is the ''Academy Award of Merit'' more popularly known as the Oscar statuette. Made of gold-plated [[britannia metal|britannium]] on a black metal base, it is 13.5&amp;nbsp;in (34&amp;nbsp;cm) tall, weighs 8.5&amp;nbsp;lb (3.85&amp;nbsp;kg) and depicts a knight rendered in [[Art Deco]] style holding a [[crusades|crusader's]] sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes. The five spokes represent the original branches of the Academy: Actors, Writers, Directors, Producers, and Technicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/about/awards/oscar.html/?pn=statuette|title= Oscar Statuette: Legacy|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate = 13 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, [[MGM]]'s art director [[Cedric Gibbons]], one of the original Academy members, supervised the design of the award [[trophy]] by printing the design on a scroll.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|url= http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2000/00.05.03.html|title= Academy to Commemorate Oscar Designer Cedric Gibbons|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|date=3 May 2007|accessdate = 13 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In need of a model for his statuette, Gibbons was introduced by his future wife [[Dolores del Río]] to Mexican film director and actor [[Emilio Fernández|Emilio &quot;El Indio&quot; Fernández]]. Reluctant at first, Fernández was finally convinced to pose nude to create what today is known as the &quot;Oscar&quot;. Then, sculptor [[George Stanley (sculptor)|George Stanley]] (who also did the Muse Fountain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.hollywoodbowl.com/about/history.cfm | title=Muse Fountain}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Hollywood Bowl]]) sculpted Gibbons's design in clay and Sachin Smith cast the statuette in 92.5 percent [[tin]] and 7.5 percent copper and then gold-plated it. The only addition to the Oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base. The original Oscar mold was cast in 1928 at the C.W. Shumway &amp; Sons Foundry in [[Batavia, Illinois]], which also contributed to casting the molds for the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]] and [[Emmy Award]]s statuettes. Since 1983,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2009/02/at_work.html#photo14| title=Eladio Gonzalez sands and buffs Oscar #3453| work=Boston Globe| date=20 February 2009| accessdate=21 February 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090223085458/http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2009/02/at_work.html| archivedate= 23 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; approximately 50 Oscars are made each year in Chicago by Illinois manufacturer [[R.S.

In support of the American effort in World War II, the statuettes were made of plaster and were traded in for gold ones after the war had ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oscars.com/legacy/?pn=statuette&amp;page=2|title= Oscar Statuette: Manufacturing, Shipping and Repairs|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate = 13 April 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927134712/http://www.oscars.com/legacy/?pn=statuette&amp;page=2  |archivedate = 27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Naming ===

The origin of the name ''Oscar'' is disputed. One biography of [[Bette Davis]] claims that she named the Oscar after her first husband, band leader Harmon Oscar Nelson;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000012/bio|title= Bette Davis biography|publisher=The Internet Movie Database|accessdate = 13 April 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070308152931/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000012/bio| archivedate= 8 March 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the earliest mentions in print of the term ''Oscar'' dates back to a [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] article about the 1934 [[6th Academy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,747239,00.html | work=Time | title=Cinema: Oscars | date=26 March 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Walt Disney]] is also quoted as thanking the Academy for his Oscar as early as 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://d23.disney.go.com/news/2010/03/oscar-winning-walt/|title= Oscar®-Winning Walt|publisher=Disney.Go.com|accessdate = 25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another claimed origin is that the Academy's Executive Secretary, [[Margaret Herrick]], first saw the award in 1931 and made reference to the statuette's reminding her of her &quot;Uncle Oscar&quot; (a nickname for her cousin Oscar Pierce).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Oscar&quot; in ''The Oxford English Dictionary'', June 2008 Draft Revision.&lt;/ref&gt; Columnist Sidney Skolsky was present during Herrick's naming and seized the name in his byline, &quot;Employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette 'Oscar'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Levy| first = Emanuel| title = All About Oscar: The History and Politics of the Academy Awards| year = 2003| publisher = Burns &amp; Oates| isbn = 978-0-8264-1452-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trophy was officially dubbed the &quot;Oscar&quot; in 1939 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

=== Ownership of Oscar statuettes ===
Since 1950, the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that neither winners nor their heirs may sell the statuettes without first offering to sell them back to the Academy for US$1. If a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation, then the Academy keeps the statuette. Academy Awards not protected by this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six-figure sums.&lt;ref&gt;(Levy 2003, pg 28)&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2011, [[Orson Welles]]' 1941 Oscar for ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' ([[Best Original Screenplay]]) was put up for auction, after his heirs won a 2004 court decision contending that Welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/12/showbiz/orson-welles-oscar/index.html|title = Orson Welles' 'Citizen Kane' Oscar for sale|publisher = CNN|first = Alan|last = Duke|date = December 12, 2011|accessdate = December 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 20, 2011, it sold in an online auction for US$861,542.&lt;ref name=&quot;Welles' Oscar sold&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Orson Welles' 'Citizen Kane' Oscar brings $861,000|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/21/showbiz/orson-welles-oscar/index.html|accessdate=April 7, 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=December 21, 2011|author=Duke, Alan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Oscar is owned by the recipient, it is essentially not on the open market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Although some Oscar sales transactions have been successful, some buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the Academy, which keeps them in its treasury.&lt;ref&gt;(Levy 2003, pg 29)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nomination ==
Since 2004, Academy Award nomination results have been announced to the public in late January. Prior to that, the results were announced in early February.

=== Voters ===
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), a professional honorary organization, maintains a voting membership of 5,783 {{as of|lc=y|2012}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author=Sandy Cohen | title=Academy Sets Oscars Contingency Plan | url=http://news.aol.com/entertainment/story/_a/oscars-contingency-plan/20080130161309990001 | work=AOL News | date=30 January 2008 | accessdate=19 March 2008| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20090203061252/http://news.aol.com/entertainment/story/_a/oscars-contingency-plan/20080130161309990001| archivedate= 3 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academy membership is divided into different branches, with each representing a different discipline in film production. Actors constitute the largest voting bloc, numbering 1,311 members (22 percent) of the Academy's composition. Votes have been certified by the auditing firm [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] (and its predecessor [[Price Waterhouse]]) for the past 73 annual awards ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4769730.stm|title = The men who are counting on Oscar|publisher=BBC News|author=Jackie Finlay|date=3 March 2006|accessdate =13 April 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070319204536/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4769730.stm| archivedate= 19 March 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All AMPAS members must be invited to join by the Board of Governors, on behalf of Academy Branch Executive Committees. Membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contribution to the field of motion pictures.

New membership proposals are considered annually. The Academy does not publicly disclose its membership, although as recently as 2007 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join. The 2007 release also stated that it has just under 6,000 voting members.

In 2012, the results of a study conducted by The Los Angeles Times was published which revealed the demographic breakdown of approximately 88% of AMPAS' voting membership. Of the 5,100+ active voters confirmed, 94% were Caucasian, 77% were male, and 54% were found to be over the age of 60. 33% of voting members are former nominees (14%) and winners (19%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Horn|first=John|title=Unmasking the Academy|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/academy/la-et-unmasking-oscar-academy-project-html,0,7473284.htmlstory|accessdate=15 October 2013|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=Feb 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the Academy sent a letter advising its 6,000 or so voting members that an online system for Oscar voting will be implemented in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/23/electronic-voting-comes-to-the-oscars-finally | work=The New York Times | first=Michael | last=Cieply | title=Electronic Voting Comes to The Oscars (Finally) | date=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rules ===
According to Rules 2 and 3 of the official Academy Awards Rules, a film must open in the previous calendar year, from midnight at the start of 1 January to midnight at the end of 31 December, in [[Los Angeles County, California]], to qualify (except for the Best Foreign Language Film).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url = http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/rule02.html
  |title = Rule Two: Eligibility
  |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
  |accessdate = 13 April 2007
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the 2009 [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] winner, ''[[The Hurt Locker]]'', was actually first released in 2008, but did not qualify for the [[81st Academy Awards|2008 awards]] as it did not play its Oscar-qualifying run in Los Angeles until mid-2009, thus qualifying for the [[82nd Academy Awards|2009 awards]].

Rule 2 states that a film must be feature-length, defined as a minimum of 40&amp;nbsp;minutes, except for short subject awards, and it must exist either on a [[35 mm film|35 mm]] or [[70 mm film]] print or in 24&amp;nbsp;frame/s or 48&amp;nbsp;frame/s [[progressive scan]] [[digital cinema]] format with native resolution not less than [[720p|1280×720]].

Producers must submit an Official Screen Credits online form before the deadline; in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline, the film will be ineligible for Academy Awards in any year. The form includes the production credits for all related categories. Then, each form is checked and put in a Reminder List of Eligible Releases.

In late December ballots and copies of the Reminder List of Eligible Releases are mailed to around 6000 active members. For most categories, members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories (i.e. only directors vote for directors, writers for writers, actors for actors, etc.). In all major categories, voters use an [[instant runoff voting]] ballot, with potential nominees rewarded in the [[single transferable vote]] tally for having strong supporters who rank them first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://oscarvotes123.blogspot.com/2011/01/with-choice-voting-for-oscar.html|title = With choice voting for Oscar nominations, passion wins}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some exceptions in the case of certain categories, like Foreign Film, Documentary and Animated Feature Film, in which movies are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches. In the special case of Best Picture, all voting members are eligible to select the nominees for that category. Foreign films must include English subtitles, and each country can submit only one film per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The winners are then determined by a second round of voting in which all members are then allowed to vote in most categories, including Best Picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:81st Academy Awards Ceremony.JPG|thumb|300px|81st Academy Awards Presentations, [[Dolby Theatre]], Hollywood, 2009]]
The major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony, most commonly in late February or early March following the relevant calendar year, and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees. It is the culmination of the film awards season, which usually begins during November or December of the previous year. This is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day. [[Black tie]] dress is the most common outfit for men, although fashion may dictate not wearing a [[bow-tie]], and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this. (The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony, and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast).

The Academy Awards is televised live across the United States (excluding Hawaii; they aired live in [[Alaska]] starting in 2011 for the first time since 1996), Canada, the United Kingdom, and gathers millions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oscar.com/oscarnight/?pn=internationalbroadcasters|title=International Broadcasters from Oscars.com|publisher=Oscars.com| archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20090225132125/http://www.oscar.com/oscarnight/?pn=internationalbroadcasters |archivedate= 25 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2007 ceremony was watched by more than 40 million Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nielsen.com/media/2008/pr_080221a.html |title=Nielsen – Press Release: The Nielsen Company's 2008 Guide to the Academy Awards |publisher=Nielsen.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other awards ceremonies (such as the Emmys, Golden Globes, and [[Grammy Award|Grammys]]) are broadcast live in the East Coast but are on [[Broadcast delay|tape delay]] in the West Coast and might not air on the same day outside North America (if the awards are even televised). The Academy has for several years claimed that the award show has up to a billion viewers internationally, but this has so far not been confirmed by any independent sources.
The Awards show was first televised in 1953, on [[NBC]], which continued to broadcast the event until 1960 when the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] Network took over, televising the festivities through 1970, after which NBC resumed the broadcasts. ABC once again took over broadcast duties in 1976 and it is under contract to do so through the year 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|url =http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2011/20110224b.html|title= ABC and Academy Extend Oscar Telecast Agreement|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences

After more than 60 years of being held in late March or early April, the ceremonies were moved up to late February or early March starting in 2004 to help disrupt and shorten the intense [[For Your Consideration (advertising)|lobbying and ad campaigns]] associated with [[Oscar season]] in the film industry. Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success of the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]], which would cut into the Academy Awards audience. The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC, as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February [[sweeps]] period. Some years, the ceremony is moved into early March in deference to the [[Winter Olympics]]. Another reason for the move to late February and early March is to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of [[Passover]] and [[Easter]], which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public. Advertising is somewhat restricted, however, as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast. The Awards show holds the distinction of having won the most [[Emmys]] in history, with 47 wins and 195 nominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2010/07/emmys-love-for-oscars-continues-with-12-nominations.html|title = Emmys love for Oscars continues with 12 nominations

After many years of being held on Mondays at 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm Eastern/6:00 p.m Pacific, in 1999 the ceremonies were moved to Sundays at 8:30&amp;nbsp;pm Eastern/5:30&amp;nbsp;pm Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/08/movies/tv-notes-moving-oscar-night.html|title = TV Notes; Moving Oscar Night|work=The New York Times |author=Bill Carter|date= 8 April 1998|accessdate = 8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on Sundays, that Los Angeles rush-hour traffic jams could be avoided, and that an earlier start time would allow viewers on the East Coast to go to bed earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19980701&amp;id=-CsiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=eqYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6637,43314 Academy Awards will move to Sunday night] Reading Eagle – 1 July 1998; From ''Google News Archive''&lt;/ref&gt; For many years the film industry had opposed a Sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1980&amp;dat=19990319&amp;id=sKEiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=laoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1224,4570799 Never Say Never: Academy Awards move to Sunday] The Item – 19 March 1999. Google News Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 March 1981, the awards ceremony was postponed for one day after [[Reagan assassination attempt|the shooting]] of President [[Ronald Reagan]] and others in Washington, D.C.

In 1993, an ''In Memoriam'' segment was introduced,&lt;ref name=&quot;fawcett&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/mar/10/oscars-farrah-fawcett|title=Farrah Fawcett:Oscars director apologises for 'In Memoriam' omission|work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=8 March 2010 | location=London | first=Ben | last=Child | date=10 March 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100414020632/http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/mar/10/oscars-farrah-fawcett| archivedate= 14 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding 12 months, a selection compiled by a small committee of Academy members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Sandy|last=Cohen|title=Oscar's 'In Memoriam' segment is touching to watch, painful to make |url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/movieawards/oscars/2010-03-03-oscar-memorial-segment_N.htm|agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=USA Today |date=3 March 2010|accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names.

In terms of broadcast length, the ceremony generally averages three and a half hours. The first Oscars, in 1929, lasted 15 minutes. At the other end of the spectrum, the 2000 ceremony lasted four hours and four minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Ehbar, Ned (February 28, 2014). &quot;Did you know?&quot; ''Metro''. New York City. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the organizers of the Academy Awards announced that winners' [[Oscar speech|acceptance speeches]] must not run past 45&amp;nbsp;seconds. This, according to organizer Bill Mechanic, was to ensure the elimination of what he termed &quot;the single most hated thing on the show&quot; – overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/feb/16/oscar-winners-speeches-cut | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Cut … all change at Oscars as winners are given just 45 seconds to say thanks | first=Sam | last=Jones | date=16 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy has contemplated about moving the ceremony even further back into January, citing TV viewers' fatigue with the film industry's long awards season. However, such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members, to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers (as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail). Also, a January ceremony would have to compete with [[National Football League]] playoff games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/05/entertainment/la-et-oscars-20101005|title = Academy looks to move 2012 Oscar ceremony up several weeks

Historically, the &quot;Oscarcast&quot; has pulled in a bigger haul when box-office hits are favored to win the Best Picture trophy. More than 57.25 million viewers tuned to the telecast for the [[70th Academy Awards]] in 1998, the year of ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', which generated close to US$600 million at the North American box office pre-Oscars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2004196530_oscarads23.html | work=The Seattle Times | title=Academy's red carpet big stage for advertisers | first=Meg | last=James | date=23 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[76th Academy Awards]] ceremony in which ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' (pre-telecast box office earnings of US$368 million) received 11 Awards including Best Picture drew 43.56 million viewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday_oscar&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/movieawards/oscars/2005-01-26-oscar-telecast_x.htm|work=USA Today |title=Oscars lack blockbuster to lure TV viewers | date=26 January 2005 | first=Scott | last=Bowles | accessdate=8 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most watched ceremony based on [[Nielsen ratings]] to date, however, was the [[42nd Academy Awards]] (Best Picture ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'') which drew a 43.4% household rating on 7 April 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Justin Oppelaar |url=http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=chart_pass&amp;charttype=chart_topshowsalltime |title=Charts and Data: Top 100 TV Shows of All Time by '&amp;#39;Variety'&amp;#39; |publisher=Variety.com |date=2002-10-09 |accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings. The [[78th Academy Awards]] which awarded low-budgeted, independent film ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'' (with a pre-Oscar gross of US$53.4 million) generated an audience of 38.64 million with a household rating of 22.91%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-03-07-nielsen-analysis_x.htm | title=Low Ratings ''Crash'' Party |work=USA Today | first=Gary | last=Levin | date=7 March 2006 | accessdate=14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, the [[80th Academy Awards]] telecast was watched by 31.76 million viewers on average with an 18.66% household rating, the lowest rated and least watched ceremony to date, in spite of celebrating 80 years of the Academy Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080227/LIFE/802270307 | title=Oscar ratings worst ever |work=The Washington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Best Picture winner of that particular ceremony was another independently financed film (''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]'').

In 1929, the first Academy Awards were presented at a banquet dinner at the [[Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]].  From 1930 to 1943, the ceremony alternated between two venues: the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] on [[Wilshire Boulevard]] and the [[Millennium Biltmore Hotel|Biltmore Hotel]] in downtown Los Angeles.

[[Grauman's Chinese Theater]] in Hollywood then hosted the awards from 1944 to 1946, followed by the [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles from 1947 to 1948. The [[21st Academy Awards]] in 1949 were held at the Academy Award Theater at what was the Academy's headquarters on [[Melrose Avenue]] in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

From 1950 to 1960, the awards were presented at Hollywood's [[Pantages Theatre (Hollywood)|Pantages Theatre]].  With the advent of television, the 1953–1957 awards took place simultaneously in Hollywood and New York first at the [[Majestic Theatre (Columbus Circle)|NBC International Theatre]] (1953) and then at the [[New Century Theatre|NBC Century Theatre]] (1954–1957), after which the ceremony took place solely in Los Angeles.  The Oscars moved to the [[Santa Monica Civic Auditorium]] in [[Santa Monica, California]] in 1961. By 1969, the Academy decided to move the ceremonies back to Los Angeles, this time to the [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]] at the [[Los Angeles Music Center|Los Angeles County Music Center]].

In 2002, the [[Dolby Theatre|Kodak Theatre]] became the permanent home of the award ceremonies.  However, due to [[Eastman Kodak]]'s bankruptcy issues, this theatre was renamed the [[Dolby Theatre|Hollywood and Highland Center]] in the days preceding the 26 February 2012, awards ceremony. As of May 2012, the theatre was once again renamed – to the [[Dolby Theatre]] – after [[Dolby Laboratories]] acquired the naming rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author=Derrick J.

In the first year of the awards, the Best Director award was split into two separate categories (Drama and Comedy).  At times, the Best Original Score award has also been split into separate categories (Drama and Comedy/Musical).  From the 1930s through the 1960s, the Art Direction (now Production Design), Cinematography, and Costume Design awards were likewise split into two separate categories (black-and-white films and color films).  Prior to 2012, the Production Design award was called Art Direction, while the Makeup and Hairstyling award was called Makeup.

Another award, entitled the [[Academy Award for Best Original Musical]], is still in the Academy rulebooks and has yet to be discontinued.  However, due to continuous insufficient eligibility each year, it has not been awarded since 1984 (when ''[[Purple Rain (film)|Purple Rain]]'' won).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/rule16.html |title=Music Awards &amp;#124; Rules for the 84th Academy Awards &amp;#124; Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences |publisher=Oscars.org |date=2012-08-24 |accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception and review ==
Due to the positive exposure and prestige of the Academy Awards, studios spend millions of dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the &quot;[[Oscar season]]&quot;. This has generated accusations of the Academy Awards being influenced more by marketing than quality. [[William Friedkin]], an Academy Award-winning film director and former producer of the ceremony, expressed this sentiment at a conference in New York in 2009, describing it as &quot;the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media |people=Friedkin, William (Director) |date=24 February 2009|title=Director William Friedkin at the Hudson Union Society |url=http://fora.tv/2009/02/24/Director_William_Friedkin_at_the_Hudson_Union_Society#William_Friedkin_Says_Oscars_Simply_a_Promotion_Scheme |accessdate=11 March 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090310081013/http://fora.tv/2009/02/24/Director_William_Friedkin_at_the_Hudson_Union_Society| archivedate= 10 March 2009| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, some winners critical of the Academy Awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their Oscars. The first to do so was [[Dudley Nichols]] (Best Writing in 1935 for ''[[The Informer (1935 film)|The Informer]]''). Nichols boycotted the [[8th Academy Awards]] ceremony because of conflicts between the Academy and the Writers' Guild.&lt;ref name=&quot;DYK&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/oscars/oscars_didyouknow.jsp|title=The Oscars Did You Know?|accessdate=18 June 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090623000022/http://www.biography.com/oscars/oscars_didyouknow.jsp| archivedate= 23 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George C. Scott]] became the second person to refuse his award (Best Actor in 1970 for ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'') at the [[43rd Academy Awards]] ceremony.

At the [[45th Academy Awards]] ceremony, Brando sent [[Sacheen Littlefeather]] to read a 15-page speech detailing his criticisms.&lt;ref name=DYK/&gt;

Tim Dirks, editor of [[American Movie Classics|AMC's]] [[filmsite.org]], has written of the Academy Awards,

{{quote|Unfortunately, the critical worth, artistic vision, cultural influence, and innovative qualities of many films are not given the same voting weight. Especially since the 1980s, moneymaking &quot;formula-made&quot; blockbusters with glossy production values have often been crowd-pleasing titans (and Best Picture winners), but they haven't necessarily been great films with depth or critical acclaim by any measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/oscars.html |title=Academy Awards – The Oscars |accessdate=4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Typical criticism of the Academy Awards for Best Picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an over-representation of romantic historical epics, biographical dramas, romantic dramedies, and family melodramas, most of which are released in the U.S. the last three months of the calendar year. This has led to the coining of the term '[[Oscar bait]]', describing such movies. Overall, the Academy appears to go through periods of rewarding a certain type of film: war-themed movies in the early 1940s; 'social issue' dramas in the late 1940s, late 1960s, and mid-2000s; musicals and historical epics in the early-to-mid-1960s; family melodramas and biographical epics in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s; atypical genres (movies formerly considered &quot;[[B movies]]&quot;) in the early 1970s and 1990s; romantic historical epic dramas in the late 1990s and early 2000s; independent violent movies from critically acclaimed directors in the late 2000s; and 20th century historical movies in the 2010s.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} This has led at times to more specific criticisms that the Academy is disconnected from the audience, e.g. by favoring 'Oscar bait' over audience favorites, or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/have_the_oscars_jumped_the_shark_LLhBrvPY35EnSH0iQzrqRJ |title=Have the Oscars jumped the shark? |accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy appears to compensate by nominating these movies in other categories, e.g. effects and editing awards for science-fiction and action movies, screenplay and supporting acting nominations for comedies, and directing, cinematography, and foreign language nominations for critically acclaimed [[art film]]s.

Acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for sentimental reasons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Taylor,+Elizabeth |title=Taylor, Elizabeth |accessdate=4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; personal popularity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://incontention.com/?p=1045 |title=What’s the worst Best Actor choice of all time? |accessdate=4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; atonement for past mistakes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bennylabamba.com/being-an-oscar-voter |title=Being an Oscar voter *doesn't* mean never having to say you're sorry - Los Angeles Times |accessdate=4 October 2009 | publisher=BennyLabamba.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or presented as a &quot;career honor&quot; to recognize a distinguished nominee's entire body of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Levy| first = Emanuel| title = All about Oscar: the history and politics of the Academy Awards – The Career Oscars| url = http://books.google.com/?id=dH2Lb_YhIhAC&amp;pg=PA268| accessdate = 4 October 2009| year = 2003| publisher = Burns &amp; Oates| isbn = 978-0-8264-1452-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Associated events ==
The following events are closely associated with the annual Academy Awards ceremony:

* Nominees luncheon
* [[Governors Awards]]
* The 25th [[Independent Spirit Awards]] (in 2010), usually held in Santa Monica the Saturday before the Oscars, marked the first time it was moved to a Friday and a change of venue to [[L.A. Live]].
* The annual &quot;Night Before,&quot; traditionally held at the [[Beverly Hills Hotel]], begun in 2002 and generally known as ''the ''party of the season, benefits the  [[Motion Picture and Television Fund]], which operates a retirement home for SAG actors in the [[San Fernando Valley]].
* [[Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Award Party]] airs the awards live at the nearby [[Pacific Design Center]].
* The Governors' Ball is the Academy's official after-party, including dinner (until 2011), and is adjacent to the awards-presentation venue.  In 2012, the three-course meal was replaced by appetizers.
* The Vanity Fair after-party, historically at the former Morton's restaurant, since 2009 has been at the [[Sunset Tower]].

== Presenter and performer gifts ==
It has been a tradition to give out gift bags to the presenters and performers at the Oscars. In later years these gifts have also been extended to award nominees and winners.&lt;ref name=ABCGiftBag&gt;{{cite web|last=Valenti|first=Catherine|title=No Oscar? How About a Gift Bag?|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=86683|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total value of these gifts can reach into the 10s of thousands of dollars. In 2014 the value was reported to be as high as US$ 80,000.&lt;ref name=CBSGiftBag&gt;{{cite web|last=Peterson|first=Kim|title=Oscars' gift bag has $80,000 worth of swag|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/oscars-gift-bag-has-80000-worth-of-swag/|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value has risen to the point where the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]] issued a statement regarding the gifts and their taxable status.&lt;ref name=IRSGiftBag&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=IRS Statement on Oscar Goodie Bags|url=http://www.irs.gov/uac/IRS-Statement-on-Oscar-Goodie-Bags|publisher=IRS.gov|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The assortment of gifts varies significantly. Oscar gift bags have included deluxe vacation packages to Hawaii and Mexico and Japan, a private dinner party for the recipient and friends at any [[Morton's The Steakhouse|Morton's steakhouse]] worldwide, [[videophone]]s, a four-night stay at Rosewood's [[Badrutt's Palace Hotel]] - a luxury hotel in [[St. Moritz, Switzerland]], Swiss-made watches, Jan Lewis Designs bangle bracelets, luxury vacation packages to the Canadian Rockies, spa treatments, bottles of luxury vodka, maple salad dressing, and weight-loss gummie candy.&lt;ref name=ABCGiftBag/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABCGiftBag2&gt;{{cite web|last=Valiente|first=Alexa|title=What Surprising Freebies Are Inside the 2014 Oscar Nominees' Gift Bags|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/surprising-freebies-inside-2014-oscar-nominees-gift-bags/story?id=22518285|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VarietyGiftBag&gt;{{cite web|last=Bacardi|first=Francesca|title=Oscar ‘Losers’ Become Winners with Distinctive Assets Gift Bags|url=http://variety.com/2014/film/news/oscar-losers-become-winners-with-distinctive-assets-gift-bags-1201100762/|publisher=Variety|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the gifts have even had a &quot;risque&quot; element to them; in 2014 the adult products retailer [[Adam &amp; Eve (company)|Adam &amp; Eve]] had a &quot;Secret Room Gifting Suite&quot;. Celebrities visiting the gifting suite included [[Judith Hoag]], [[Carolyn Hennesy]], [[Kate Linder]], [[Chris Mulkey]], [[Jim O'Heir]], and [[NBA]] star [[John Salley]].&lt;ref name=AandEOscarGifts&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=Adam &amp; Eve Had Secret Room Gifting Suite for Oscars' Celebs|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/novelty/Adam-Eve-Had-Secret-Room-Gifting-Suite-for-Oscars-Celebs-551833.html|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Actrius''''' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]: ''Actresses'') is a 1996 film directed by [[Ventura Pons]]. In the film, there are no male actors and the four leading actresses dubbed themselves in the Castilian version.

==Synopsis==
In order to prepare the role of an important old actress, a theatre student interviews three actresses who were her pupils: an international diva (Glòria Marc, played by [[Núria Espert]]), a television star (Assumpta Roca, played by [[Rosa Maria Sardà]]) and a dubbing director (Maria Caminal, played by [[Anna Lizaran]]).

'''''Animalia''''' is an illustrated [[Children's literature|children's book]] by [[Graeme Base]].  It was originally published in 1986, followed by a tenth anniversary edition in 1996 and a 25th anniversary edition in 2012.  Over three million copies have been sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Puffin Books|title=Animalia 25th Anniversary Edition|url=http://www.puffin.com.au/products/9780670076673/animalia-25th-anniversary-edition|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A special numbered and signed anniversary edition was also published in 1996 with an embossed gold jacket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=ABE Books|title=Animalia (Numbered and Signed anniversary edition)|url=http://www.abebooks.com/Animalia-Numbered-Signed-Anniversary-Edition-Base/3201558151/bd|accessdate=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
''Animalia'' is an [[alliteration|alliterative]] [[alphabet]] book and contains twenty-six illustrations, one for each letter of the alphabet.  Each illustration features an animal from the animal kingdom (A is for [[alligator]], B is for [[butterfly]], etc.) along with a short poem utilizing the letter of the page for many of the words.  The illustrations contain many other objects beginning with that letter that the reader can try to identify. As an additional challenge, the author has hidden a picture of himself as a child in every picture.

'''International Atomic Time''' ('''TAI''', from the French name '''Temps atomique international'''&lt;ref&gt;Temps atomique 1975&lt;/ref&gt;) is a high-precision atomic [[coordinate time|coordinate]] [[time standard]] based on the notional passage of [[proper time]] on [[Earth]]'s [[geoid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1986CeMec..38..155G |title=Is the International Atomic Time TAI a coordinate time or a proper time? |publisher=Adsabs.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the basis for [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC), which is used for civil timekeeping all over the Earth's surface, and for [[Terrestrial Time]], which is used for astronomical calculations. Since 30 June 2012 when the last [[leap second]] was added,&lt;ref name=&quot;bulletinc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= ftp://hpiers.obspm.fr/iers/bul/bulc/bulletinc.43 |title= Bulletin C 43: UTC time step on the 1st of July 2012 [sic] | publisher= [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service|IERS EOP PC]], [[Paris Observatory|Observatoire de Paris]] |accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; TAI has been exactly 35 seconds ahead of UTC. The 35 seconds results from the initial difference of 10 seconds at the start of 1972, plus 25 [[leap second]]s in UTC since 1972.

Time coordinates on the TAI scales are conventionally specified using traditional means of specifying days, carried over from non-uniform time standards based on the rotation of the Earth. Specifically, both [[Julian Date]]s and the [[Gregorian calendar]] are used. TAI in this form was synchronised with [[Universal Time]] at the beginning of 1958, and the two have drifted apart ever since, due to the changing motion of the Earth.

==Operation==

TAI as a time scale is a weighted average of the time kept by over 200 [[atomic clock]]s in over 50 national laboratories worldwide.{{sfn|Time|n.d.}} The clocks are compared using [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] signals and [[two-way satellite time and frequency transfer]].&lt;ref&gt;Circular T 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the averaging it is far more stable than any clock would be alone (see [[signal averaging]] for a discussion). The majority of the clocks are [[Atomic clock|caesium clocks]]; the definition of the [[International System of Units|SI]] second is written in terms of [[caesium]].&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy &amp;Seidelmann 2009, 207, 214&lt;/ref&gt;

The participating institutions each broadcast, in [[real-time data|real time]], a frequency signal with [[timecode]]s, which is their estimate of TAI.  Time codes are usually published in the form of UTC, which differs from TAI by a well-known integer number of seconds.  These time scales are denoted in the form ''UTC(NPL)'' in the UTC form, where ''NPL'' in this case identifies the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK]].  The TAI form may be denoted ''TAI(NPL)''.  The latter is not to be confused with ''TA(NPL)'', which denotes an independent atomic time scale, not synchronised to TAI or to anything else.

The clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other.  The [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM, France), combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Time&quot; n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;  This combined time scale is published monthly in [ftp://ftp2.bipm.fr/pub/tai/publication/cirt/ Circular T], and is the [[Canonical form|canonical]] TAI.  This time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences UTC-UTC(''k'') (equivalent to TAI-TAI(''k'')) for each participating institution ''k''.  (The same circular also gives tables of TAI-TA(''k''), for the various unsynchronised atomic time scales.)

Errors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty Circular T or by errata in a subsequent Circular T.  Aside from this, once published in Circular T the TAI scale is not revised.  In hindsight it is possible to discover errors in TAI, and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale.  Doing so does not create another version of TAI; it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of [[Terrestrial Time]] (TT).

==History==
Early atomic time scales consisted of quartz clocks with frequencies calibrated by a single atomic clock; the atomic clocks were not operated continuously. Atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in 1955, using the first caesium atomic clock at the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory, UK (NPL)]]. The &quot;Greenwich Atomic&quot; (GA) scale began in 1955 at the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]]. The [[International Time Bureau]] (BIH) began a time scale, T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; or AM, in July 1955, using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of [[VLF]] radio signals. The [[United States Naval Observatory]] began the A.1 scale  13 September 1956, using an Atomichron commercial atomic clock, followed by the NBS-A scale at the National Bureau of Standards, [[Boulder, Colorado]].   Both the BIH scale and A.1 was defined by an [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]] at the beginning of 1958: it was set to read Julian Date 2436204.5 (1 January 1958 00:00:00) at the corresponding [[UT2]] instant. The procedures used by the BIH evolved, and the name for the time scale changed: &quot;A3&quot; in 1963 and &quot;TA(BIH)&quot; in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy &amp; Seidelmann 2009, 199&amp;ndash;201.&lt;/ref&gt;  This synchronisation was inevitably imperfect, depending as it did on the [[astronomy|astronomical]] realisation of UT2.  At the time, UT2 as published by various observatories differed by several hundredths of a second.

In 1961, UTC began.  UTC is a discontinuous time scale composed from segments that are linear transformations of atomic time, the discontinuities being arranged so that UTC approximated [[UT2]] until the end of 1971, and [[UT1]] thereafter.  This was a compromise arrangement for a broadcast time scale: a linear transformation of the BIH's atomic time meant that the time scale was stable and internationally synchronised, while approximating UT1 means that tasks such as [[navigation]] which require a source of Universal Time continue to be well served by public time broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy &amp; Seidelmann 2009, 227&amp;ndash;9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The SI second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in 1967, and in 1971 the name International Atomic Time (TAI) was assigned to a time scale based on SI seconds with no leap seconds.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy &amp; Seidelmann 2009, 202&amp;ndash;4.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, irregularities in the atomic time were detected and corrected. In 1967 it was suggested that nearby masses caused clocks to operate at different rates, but this was disproven in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;William Markowitz. &quot;Nondependence of Frequency on Mass: A Differential Experiment&quot; [[doi:10.1126/science.162.3860.1387]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, it became clear that the clocks participating in TAI were ticking at different rates due to [[gravitational time dilation]], and the combined TAI scale therefore corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks.  Starting from Julian Date 2443144.5 (1 January 1977 00:00:00), corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks, so that TAI would correspond to proper time at [[mean sea level]] (the geoid).  Because the clocks had been on average well above sea level, this meant that TAI slowed down, by about 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;.  The former uncorrected time scale continues to be published, under the name ''EAL'' (''Echelle Atomique Libre'', meaning ''Free Atomic Scale'').&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy &amp; Seidelmann, 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

The instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for [[Barycentric Coordinate Time]] (TCB), [[Geocentric Coordinate Time]] (TCG), and [[Terrestrial Time]] (TT).  All three of these time scales were defined to read JD 2443144.5003725 (1 January 1977 00:00:32.184) exactly at that instant.  (The offset is to provide continuity with the older [[Ephemeris Time]].)  TAI was henceforth a realisation of TT, with the equation TT(TAI) = TAI + 32.184&amp;nbsp;s.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy &amp; Seidelmann, 218&amp;ndash;9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The continued existence of TAI was questioned in a 2007 letter from the BIPM to the ITU-R which stated &quot;In the case of a redefinition of UTC without leap seconds, the CCTF would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing TAI, as it would remain parallel to the continuous UTC.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite web

[[File:Belisaire demandant l'aumone Jacques-Louis David.jpg|thumb|325px|Giving [[alms]] to the poor is often considered an altruistic action.]]

'''Altruism''' or '''selflessness''' is the principle or practice of concern for the [[Quality of life|welfare]] of others. It is a traditional [[virtue]] in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions and secular worldviews, though the concept of &quot;others&quot; toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions. Altruism or selflessness is the opposite of [[selfishness]].

Altruism can be distinguished from feelings of [[loyalty]]. Pure altruism consists of sacrificing something for someone other than the self (e.g. sacrificing time, energy or possessions) with no expectation of any compensation or benefits, either direct, or indirect (e.g., receiving recognition for the act of giving).

Much debate exists as to whether ''&quot;true&quot;'' altruism is possible. The theory of [[psychological egoism]] suggests that no act of sharing, helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic, as the actor may receive an [[intrinsic]] reward in the form of personal [[gratification]]. The validity of this argument depends on whether [[Motivation#Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|intrinsic rewards]] qualify as &quot;benefits.&quot;

The term ''[[altruism (ethics)|altruism]]'' may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others. Used in this sense, it is usually contrasted with [[ethical egoism|egoism]], which is defined as acting to the benefit of one's self.

==The notion of altruism==
The concept has a long history in [[Philosophy|philosophical]] and [[Ethics|ethical]] thought. The term was originally coined in the 19th century by the founding [[sociologist]] and [[philosopher of science]], [[Auguste Comte]], and has become a major topic for [[psychologists]] (especially [[evolutionary psychology]] researchers), [[evolutionary biologists]], and [[ethology|ethologists]]. Whilst ideas about altruism from one field can have an impact on the other fields, the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism. In simple terms, altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them.

== Individual variations ==
A certain individual may behave altruistically in one case and egoistically in another situation. However, some individuals tend to behave more altruistically, while others tend to behave more egoistically. Altruism may be considered a general attitude to the point where altruism has been considered as a [[Phenotypic trait|trait]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rushton |first1=J.P. |author2=Chrisjohn, R. D. and Fekken, G. C. |title=The altruistic personality and the self-report altruism scale|journal=Personality and Individual Differences |year=1981 |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=293–302 |url=http://www.subjectpool.com/ed_teach/y3project/Rushton1981THE_ALTRUISTIC_PERSONALITY.pdf |doi=10.1016/0191-8869(81)90084-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1986 study estimated that altruism was half-[[Heritability|inherited]].&lt;ref group=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;The study covered 5 related traits, giving a broad heritability estimate of 56% for altruism, but then approximated all to 50%, and raised the maximum-likelihood heritability to 60% after corrections for unreliability.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rushton|first1=Jean Philippe |last2=Fulker|first2= D.

Also based on the twin design, the new study estimated that genetic differences accounted for approximately 20% of individual variations.&lt;ref group=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;The study generally refers to the trait studied as &quot;giving&quot;. It uses the word &quot;altruism&quot; too once.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Cesarini|first1=David |last2=Dawes|first2=Christopher |last3=Johannesson|first3=Magnus |last4=Lichtenstein|first4=Paul |last5=Wallace|first5=Björn| title=Genetic Variation in Preferences for Giving and Risk Taking|journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics|date=May 2009|volume=124|issue=2|pages=809–842|url=https://files.nyu.edu/dac12/public/CesariniQJE2009.pdf| doi=10.1162/qjec.2009.124.2.809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific viewpoints==

===Anthropology===
[[Marcel Mauss]]'s book ''The Gift'' contains a passage: &quot;Note on alms.&quot; This note describes the evolution of the notion of alms (and by extension of altruism) from the notion of sacrifice. In it, he writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Alms are the fruits of a moral notion of the gift and of fortune on the one hand,
and of a notion of sacrifice, on the other. Generosity is an obligation, because Nemesis
avenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of happiness and wealth
of certain people who should rid themselves of it. This is the ancient morality of the
gift, which has become a principle of justice. The gods and the spirits accept that
the share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had been
hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Compare [[altruism (ethics)|Altruism (ethics) – perception of altruism as self-sacrifice]].
* Compare [[alms|explanation of alms in various scriptures]].

===Evolutionary explanations===

[[File:Manner of Francis Wheatley, Giving alms to beggar children.jpg|thumb|180px|Giving alms to beggar children]]
In the science of [[ethology]] (the study of animal behaviour), and more generally in the study of [[social evolution]], altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bell2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Bell| first = Graham| title = Selection: the mechanism of evolution| year = 2008| publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford| isbn = 0-19-856972-6| pages = 367–368 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[evolutionary psychology]] this may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as charity, emergency aid, help to coalition partners, [[Tip (gratuity)|tipping]], courtship gifts, production of [[public good]]s, and [[environmentalism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AEP1&quot;&gt;Pat Barcaly. The evolution of charitable behaviour and the power of reputation. In {{cite doi|10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199586073.001.0001|noedit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theories of apparently altruistic behavior were accelerated by the need to produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins. Two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and from [[evolutionary game theory]] a mathematical model and analysis of behavioural strategies.

Some of the proposed mechanisms are:
* [[Kin selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biological Altruism|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/altruism-biological/#2|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Okasha|first=Samir|accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; That animals and humans are more altruistic towards close kin than to distant kin and non-kin has been confirmed in numerous studies across many different cultures. Even subtle cues indicating kinship may unconsciously increase altruistic behavior. One kinship cue is facial resemblance. One study found that slightly altering photographs so that they more closely resembled the faces of study participants increased the trust the participants expressed regarding depicted persons. Another cue is having the same family name, especially if rare, and this has been found to increase helping behavior. Another study found more cooperative behavior the greater the number the perceived kin in a group. Using kinship terms in political speeches increased audience agreement with the speaker in one study. This effect was especially strong for firstborns, who are typically close to their families.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
* Vested interests. People are likely to suffer if their friends, allies, and similar social [[ingroup]]s suffer or even disappear. Helping such group members may therefore eventually benefit the altruist. Making ingroup membership more noticeable increases cooperativeness. Extreme self-sacrifice towards the ingroup may be adaptive if a hostile [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]] threatens to kill the entire ingroup.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
* [[Reciprocal altruism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/406755|last1=Trivers|first1=R.L.|year=1971|title=The evolution of reciprocal altruism|journal=Quarterly Review of Biology|volume=46|pages=35–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Reciprocity (evolution)]].
** Direct [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.7466396 |author=R Axelrod and WD Hamilton |title=The evolution of cooperation |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=211 |issue=4489 |date=27 March 1981 |pages=1390–1396 |pmid=7466396 |bibcode = 1981Sci...211.1390A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that it can be beneficial to help others if there is a chance that they can and will reciprocate the help. The effective [[tit for tat]] strategy is one [[game theory|game theoretic]] example. Many people seem to be following a similar strategy by cooperating if and only if others cooperate in return.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

::One consequence is that people are more cooperative if it is more likely that individuals will interact again in the future. People tend to be less cooperative if they perceive that the frequency of helpers in the population is lower. They tend to help less if they see non-cooperativeness by others and this effect tend to be stronger than the opposite effect of seeing cooperative behaviors. Simply changing the cooperative framing of a proposal may increase cooperativeness such as calling it a &quot;Community Game&quot; instead of a &quot;Wall Street Game.&quot;&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

::A tendency towards reciprocity implies that people will feel obligated to respond if someone helps them. This has been used by charities that give small gifts to potential donors hoping thereby to induce reciprocity. Another method is to announce publicly that someone has given a large donation. The tendency to reciprocate can even generalize so people become more helpful toward others in general after being helped. On the other hand, people will avoid or even retaliate against those perceived not to be cooperating. People sometimes mistakenly fail to help when they intended to, or their helping may not be noticed, which may cause unintended conflicts. As such, it may be an optimal strategy to be slightly forgiving of and have a slightly generous interpretation of non-cooperation.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

::People are more likely to cooperate on a task if they can communicate with one another first. This may be due to better assessments of cooperativeness or due to exchange of promises. They are more cooperative if they can gradually build trust, instead of being asked to give extensive help immediately. Direct reciprocity and cooperation in a group can be increased by changing the focus and incentives from intra-group competition to larger scale competitions such as between groups or against the general population. Thus, giving grades and promotions based only on an individual's performance relative to a small local group, as is common, may reduce cooperative behaviors in the group.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
** Indirect reciprocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature04131|author=Martin Nowak &amp; Karl Sigmund|title=Evolution of indirect reciprocity|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=437|issue=27|date=October 2005|pages=1291–1298|pmid=16251955|bibcode = 2005Natur.437.1291N }}&lt;/ref&gt; The avoidance of poor reciprocators and cheaters causes a person's [[reputation]] to become very important. A person with a good reputation for reciprocity have a higher chance of receiving help even from persons they have had no direct interactions with previously.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
** [[Strong reciprocity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Herbert Gintis]]|title=Strong Reciprocity and Human Sociality|journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Biology]]|volume=206|issue=2|date=September 2000|pmid=10966755|pages=169–179|doi=10.1006/jtbi.2000.2111}}&lt;/ref&gt; A form of reciprocity where some individuals seem to spend more resources on cooperating and punishing than would be most beneficial as predicted by several established theories of altruism. A number of theories have been proposed as explanations as well as criticisms regarding its existence.
** Pseudo-reciprocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2003|title=Genetic and Cultural Evolution of Cooperation, Chapter 11|isbn=0-262-08326-4|publisher=Dahlem Workshop Reports|location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; An organism behaves altruistically and the recipient does not reciprocate but has an increased chance of acting in a way that is selfish but also as a byproduct benefits the altruist.
* [[Signalling theory|Costly signaling]] and the [[handicap principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.2307/3677205|last1=Zahavi|first1=A.|year=1995|title=Altruism as a handicap – The limitations of kin selection and reciprocity|jstor=3677205|journal=Avian Biol|volume=26|issue=1|pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since altruism takes away resources from the altruist it can be an &quot;honest signal&quot; of resource availability and the abilities needed to gather resources. This may signal to others that the altruist is a valuable potential partner. It may also be a signal of interactive and cooperative intentions since those not interacting further in the future gain nothing from the costly signaling. It is unclear if costly signaling can indicate a long-term cooperative personality but people have increased trust for those who help. Costly signaling is pointless if everyone has the same traits, resources, and cooperative intentions but become a potentially more important signal if the population increasingly varies on these characteristics.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

:Hunters widely sharing the meat has been seen as a costly signal of ability and research has found that good hunters have higher reproductive success and more adulterous relations even if they themselves receive no more of the hunted meat than anyone else. Similarly, holding large feasts and giving large donations has been seen as ways of demonstrating one's resources. Heroic risk-taking has also been interpreted as a costly signal of ability.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

[[File:FEMA - 15337 - Photograph by Andrea Booher taken on 09-10-2005 in Texas.jpg|thumb|Volunteers assist Hurricane victims at the [[Houston Astrodome]], following Hurricane Katrina.]]
:Both indirect reciprocity and costly signaling depend on the value of reputation and tend to make similar predictions. One is that people will be more helping when they know that their helping behavior will be communicated to people they will interact with later, is publicly announced, is discussed, or is simply being observed by someone else. This have been documented in many studies. The effect is sensitive to subtle cues such as people being more helpful when there were stylized eyespots instead of a logo on a computer screen. Weak reputational cues such as eyespots may become unimportant if there are stronger cues present and may lose their effect with continued exposure unless reinforced with real reputational effects.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt; Public displays such as public weeping for dead celebrities and participation in demonstrations may be influenced by a desire to be seen as altruistic. People who know that they are publicly monitored sometimes even wastefully donate money they know are not needed by recipient which may be because of reputational concerns.&lt;ref name=&quot;AEP2&quot;&gt;Wendy Iredal and Mark van Vugt. Altruism as showing off: a signaling perspective on promoting green behaviour and acts of kindness. In {{cite doi|10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199586073.001.0001|noedit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Women have been found to find altruistic men to be attractive partners. When looking for a long-term partner more conventional altruism may be preferred which may indicate that he is also willing to share resources with her and her children while when looking for a short-term partner heroic risk-taking, which may be costly signal showing good genes, may be more preferable. Men also perform more altruistic acts in the early stages of a romantic relationship or simply when in the presence of an attractive woman. While both sexes state that kindness is the most preferable trait in a partner there is some evidence that men place less value on this than women and that women may not be more altruistic in presence of an attractive man. Men may even avoid altruistic women in short-term relationships which may be because they expect less success.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;&lt;ref name=AEP2/&gt;

:People may compete over getting the benefits of a high reputation which may cause [[competitive altruism]]. On other hand, in some experiments a proportion of people do not seem to care about reputation and they do not help more even if this is conspicuous. This may possibly be due to reasons such as [[psychopathy]] or that they are so attractive that they need not be seen to be altruistic. The reputational benefits of altruism occur in the future as compared to the immediate costs of altruism in the present. While humans and other organisms generally place less value on future costs/benefits as compared to those in the present, some have shorter time horizons than others and these people tend to be less cooperative.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

:Explicit extrinsic rewards and punishments have been found to sometimes actually have the opposite effect on behaviors compared to intrinsic rewards. This may be because such extrinsic, top-down incentives may replace (partially or in whole) intrinsic and reputational incentives, motivating the person to focus on obtaining the extrinsic rewards, which overall may make the behaviors less desirable. Another effect is that people would like altruism to be due to a personality characteristic rather than due to overt reputational concerns and simply pointing out that there are reputational benefits of an action may actually reduce them. This may possibly be used as derogatory tactic against altruists, especially by those who are non-cooperators. A counterargument is that doing good due to reputational concerns is better than doing no good at all.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
* [[Group selection]]. It has controversially been argued by some evolutionary scientists such as [[E. O. Wilson]] that natural selection can act at the level of non-kin groups to produce adaptations that benefit a non-kin group even if these adaptions are detrimental at the individual level. Thus, while altruistic persons may under some circumstances be outcompeted by less altruistic persons at the individual level, according to group selection theory the opposite may occur at the group level where groups consisting of the more altruistic persons may outcompete groups consisting of the less altruistic persons. Such altruism may only extend to ingroup members while there may instead prejudice and antagonism against outgroup members (See also [[in-group favoritism]]). Group selection theory has been criticized by many other evolutionary scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Neyfakh

[[File:Helping the homeless.jpg|right|thumb|Helping the homeless in New York City]]
Such explanations do not imply that humans are always consciously calculating how to increase their [[inclusive fitness]] when they are doing altruistic acts. Instead, evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms, such as emotions, that promote altruistic behaviors.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

Every single instance of altruistic behavior need not always increase inclusive fitness; altruistic behaviors would have been selected for if such behaviors on average increased inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment. This need not imply that on average 50% or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the altruist in the ancestral environment; if the benefits from helping the right person were very high it would be beneficial to err on the side of caution and usually be altruistic even if in most cases there were no benefits.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

The benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups. Research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to no-kin, to friends than to strangers, to those attractive than to those unattractive, to non-competitors than to competitors, and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

The study of altruism was the initial impetus behind [[George R. Price]]'s development of the [[Price equation]], which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution. An interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular [[slime mould]]s, such as ''[[Dictyostelid|Dictyostelium]] mucoroides.'' These protists live as individual [[amoebae]] until starved, at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body.

Selective investment theory proposes that close social bonds, and associated emotional, cognitive, and neurohormonal mechanisms, evolved in order to facilitate long-term, high-cost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1207/s15327965pli1701_01|last1=Brown|first1=S.L.|last2=Brown|first2=R.M.|year=2006|title=Selective investment theory: Recasting the functional significance of close relationships|url=http://icos.groups.si.umich.edu/Brown-Stephanie.pdf|format=PDF|journal=Psychological Inquiry|volume=17|pages=1–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for left-wing politics such by the Russian zoologist and anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]] in his 1902 book ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'' and [[Peter Singer]] in his book ''[[A Darwinian Left]].''

Most recently, [[Jeremy Griffith]] has proposed a biological theory for the development of truly altruistic instincts that accommodates the biological imperative to reproduce, as evidenced by a moral conscience visible in humans today.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith J. 2011. ''Conscience''. In ''The Book of Real Answers to Everything!'' ISBN 9781741290073. http://www.worldtransformation.com/conscience/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurobiology===
Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman, neuroscientists at the [[National Institutes of Health]] and LABS-D'Or Hospital Network (J.M.) provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers, using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]]. In their research, published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] USA in October, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Human fronto–mesolimbic networks guide decisions about charitable donation, PNAS 2006:103(42);15623–15628&lt;/ref&gt; they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the [[Mesolimbic pathway|mesolimbic]] reward pathway, a primitive part of the brain that usually lights up in response to food and sex. However, when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations, another brain circuit was selectively activated: the subgenual cortex/septal region. These structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species. Altruism, the experiment suggested, was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain, hard-wired and pleasurable.&lt;ref name=&quot;brain&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Another experiment funded by the [[National Institutes of Health]] and conducted in 2007 at the [[Duke University]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]] suggests a different view, &quot;that altruistic behavior may originate from how people view the world rather than how they act in it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/61312.php &quot;Brain Scan Predicts Difference Between Altruistic And Selfish People&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; In the study published in the February 2007 print issue of [[Nature Neuroscience]], researchers have found a part of the brain that behaves differently for altruistic and selfish people.

The researchers invited 45 volunteers to play a computer game and also to watch the computer play the game. In some rounds, the game resulted in the volunteers winning money for themselves, and in others it resulted in money being donated to a charity of the volunteer's choice. During these activities, the researchers took functional magnetic resonance imaging ([[fMRI]]) scans of the participants' brains and were &quot;surprised by the results&quot;. Although they &quot;were expecting to see activity in the brain's reward centers,&quot; based on the idea that &quot;people perform altruistic acts because they feel good about it,&quot; what they found was that &quot;another part of the brain was also involved, and it was quite sensitive to the difference between doing something for personal gain and doing it for someone else's gain.&quot; That part of the brain is called the posterior superior [[temporal cortex]] (pSTC).

In the next stage, the scientists asked the participants some questions about type and frequency of their altruistic or helping behaviours. They then analysed the responses to generate an estimate of a person's tendency to act altruistically and compared each person's level of altruism against their [[fMRI]] [[brain scan]]. The results showed that pSTC activity rose in proportion to a person's self-reported level of altruism. According to the researchers, the results suggest that altruistic behavior may originate from how people view the world rather than how they act in it. &quot;We believe that the ability to perceive other people's actions as meaningful is critical for altruism,&quot; said lead study investigator Dharol Tankersley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/01/070121162756.htm &quot;Activation Of Brain Region Predicts Altruism&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychology===
The International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences defines ''psychological altruism'' as &quot;a motivational state with the goal of increasing another’s welfare.&quot; Psychological altruism is contrasted with ''psychological egoism,'' which refers to the motivation to increase one’s own welfare.&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia&quot;&gt;[&quot;Altruism.&quot; International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. Ed. William A. Darity, Jr. 2nd ed. Vol. 1. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2008. 87-88. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 10 April 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some debate on whether or not humans are truly capable of psychological altruism.&lt;ref name=&quot;batson3&quot;&gt;[Batson, C. (2011). Altruism in humans. New York, NY US: Oxford University Press.]&lt;/ref&gt; Some definitions specify a self-sacrificial nature to altruism and a lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors.&lt;ref name=&quot;prosocial&quot;&gt;[Batson, C. (2012). A history of prosocial behavior research. In A. W. Kruglanski, W. Stroebe, A. W. Kruglanski, W. Stroebe (Eds.), Handbook of the history of social psychology (pp. 243–264). New York, NY US: Psychology Press.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, because altruism ultimately benefits the self in many cases, the selflessness of altruistic acts is brought to question. The [[social exchange theory]] postulates that altruism only exists when benefits outweigh costs.&lt;ref name=&quot;noaltruism&quot;&gt;[Maner, J. K., Luce, C. L., Neuberg, S. L., Cialdini, R. B., Brown, S., &amp; Sagarin, B. J. (2002). The effects of perspective taking on motivations for helping: Still no evidence for altruism. Personality And Social Psychology Bulletin, 28(11), 1601–1610. doi:10.1177/014616702237586]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Batson]] is a psychologist who examined this question and argues against the social exchange theory. He identified four major motives for altruism: altruism to ultimately benefit the self (egoism), to ultimately benefit the other person (altruism), to benefit a group (collectivism), or to uphold a moral principle ([[principlism]]). Altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism, but the general conclusion has been that empathy-induced altruism can be genuinely selfless.&lt;ref name=&quot; baston2&quot;&gt;[Batson, C., Ahmad, N., &amp; Stocks, E. L. (2011). Four forms of prosocial motivation: Egoism, altruism, collectivism, and principlism. In D. Dunning, D. Dunning (Eds.), Social motivation (pp. 103–126). New York, NY US: Psychology Press.]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[empathy-altruism]] hypothesis'' basically states that psychological altruism does exist and is evoked by the empathic desire to help someone who is suffering. Feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with feelings of personal distress, which compel people to reduce their own unpleasant emotions. People with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided, whereas those lacking in empathic concern avoid helping unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to another's suffering.&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia&quot;/&gt; Helping behavior is seen in humans at about two years old, when a toddler is capable of understanding subtle emotional cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Svetlova|first1=M.|last2=Nichols|first2=S.

In psychological research on altruism, studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping, comforting, sharing, cooperation, philanthropy, and community service.&lt;ref name=&quot;prosocial&quot;/&gt; Research has found that people are most likely to help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the person's distress. Research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping (the ''[[Bystander effect]]''). Greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, James M. &amp; Bruckman, Amy S.

===Sociology===
&quot;Sociologists have long been concerned with how to build the good society&quot; (&quot;Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity&quot;. American Sociological Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asanet.org/sections/altruism.cfm American Sociological Association: Altruism, Morality and Social Solidarity&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;). The structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable, philanthropic, and other pro-social, altruistic actions for the common good is a largely researched topic within the field. The American Sociology Association (ASA) acknowledges [[Public sociology]] saying, &quot;The intrinsic scientific, policy, and public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct 'good societies' is unquestionable&quot; (&quot;Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity&quot; ASA). This type of sociology seeks contributions that aid grassroots and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it is organized, and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies. How altruism is framed, organized, carried out, and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus that sociologists seek to investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and &quot;build the good society&quot;.

==Religious viewpoints==
{{See also|Evolutionary origin of religions}}
Most, if not all, of the world's religions promote altruism as a very important moral value. [[Buddhism]], Christianity, [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Jainism]], Judaism and [[Sikhism]], etc., place particular emphasis on altruistic morality.

===Buddhism===
[[File:Monks collecting alms - Bun Vat Phu.JPG|thumb|Monks collecting alms]]
Altruism figures prominently in Buddhism. Love and compassion are components of all forms of Buddhism, and are focused on all beings equally: love is the wish that all beings be happy, and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering. &quot;Many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion. These qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness, and the need for them lies at the very core of our being&quot; (Dalai Lama).&lt;ref name=&quot;Speech by the Dalai Lama&quot;&gt;[http://www.dalailama.com/page.65.htm Speech by the Dalai Lama]&lt;br&gt;The phrase &quot;core of our being&quot; is [[Freudian]]; see {{Cite journal | author = Bettina Bock von Wülfingen | year = 2013 | title = Freud's 'Core of our Being' Between Cytology and Psychoanalysis | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bewi.201301604/pdf | journal = Berichte zur Wissenschaftsgeschichte | volume = 36 | pages = 226–244 | doi = 10.1002/bewi.201301604 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since &quot;all beings&quot; includes the individual, love and compassion in Buddhism are outside the opposition between self and other. It is even said that the distinction between self and other is part of the root cause of our suffering. In practical terms, however, since most of us are spontaneously self-centered, Buddhism encourages us to focus love and compassion on others, and thus can be characterized as &quot;altruistic.&quot; Many would agree with the [[Dalai Lama]] that Buddhism as a religion is kindness toward others.

Still, the notion of altruism is modified in such a world-view, since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness: &quot;The more we care for the happiness of others, the greater our own sense of well-being becomes&quot; (Dalai Lama&lt;ref name=&quot;Speech by the Dalai Lama&quot;/&gt;).

In the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment, Buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative (unhappy) consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment, but from the law of karma, which functions like a natural law of cause and effect. A simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what I cause: if I cause suffering, then as a natural consequence I will experience suffering; if I cause happiness, then as a natural consequence I will experience happiness.

{{Main|Karma in Buddhism}}
In Buddhism, ''karma'' (Pāli ''kamma'') is strictly distinguished from '''''[[vipaka|vipāka]]''''', meaning &quot;fruit&quot; or &quot;result&quot;. Karma is categorized within the group or groups of cause (Pāli ''hetu'') in the [[Twelve nidanas|chain]] of [[Pratitya-samutpada|cause and effect]], where it comprises the elements of &quot;volitional activities&quot; (Pali ''sankhara'') and &quot;action&quot; (Pali ''bhava''). Any action is understood to create &quot;seeds&quot; in the mind that sprout into the appropriate results (Pāli ''vipaka'') when they meet the right conditions. Most types of karmas, with good or bad results, will keep one in the wheel of [[Samsara (Buddhism)|samsāra]]; others will liberate one to [[nirvana|nirvāna]].

Buddhism relates karma directly to motives behind an action. Motivation usually makes the difference between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot;, but motivation also includes the aspect of ignorance; so a well-intended action from an ignorant mind can easily be &quot;bad&quot; in that it creates unpleasant results for the &quot;actor.&quot;

In Buddhism, karma is not the only cause of all that happens. As taught in the early texts, the commentarial tradition classified causal mechanisms governing the universe in five categories, known as Niyama Dhammas:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Davids| first = Rhys| title = Buddhism| url = http://books.google.com/?id=LljcZ_LBeL0C&amp;pg=PA119| year = 2007| publisher = Lightning Source Incorporated| isbn = 978-1-4067-5628-9| page = 119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Padmasiri de Silva| title = Environmental Philosophy and Ethics in Buddhism| url = http://books.google.com/?id=M4T3C6ndfZIC&amp;pg=PA41| year = 1998| publisher = Palgrave Macmillan| isbn = 978-0-312-21316-9| page = 41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Kamma Niyama — Consequences of one's actions
* Utu Niyama — Seasonal changes and climate
* Biija Niyama — Laws of heredity
* Citta Niyama — Will of mind
* Dhamma Niyama — Nature's tendency to produce a perfect type

===Jainism===
The fundamental principles of [[Jainism]] revolve around the concept of altruism, not only for humans but for all sentient beings. Jainism preaches the view of [[Ahimsa]] – to live and let live, thereby not harming sentient beings, i.e. uncompromising reverence for all life. It also considers all living things to be equal. The first Thirthankar, Rishabh introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings, from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation, giving oneself up for others, non-violence and compassion for all living things.

Jainism prescribes a path of non-violence to progress the soul to this ultimate goal. Jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation, one must practice the following ethical principles (major vows) in thought, speech and action. The degree to which these principles are practiced is different for householders and monks. They are:
# Non-violence (Ahimsa);
# Truthfulness (Satya);
# Non-stealing (Asteya);
# Celibacy (Brahmacharya);
# Non-possession or non-materialism (Aparigraha);

A major characteristic of Jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors. One's unconquered mind with anger, pride (ego), deceit, greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans. Anger spoils good relations, pride destroys humility, deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything. Jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness, pride (ego) by humility, deceit by straight-forwardness and greed by contentment.

The principle of non-violence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul. Jainism views every soul as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become Siddha (Param-atma – &quot;highest soul&quot;). Because all living beings possess a soul, great care and awareness is essential in one's actions. Jainism emphasizes the equality of all life, advocating harmlessness towards all, whether the creatures are great or small. This policy extends even to microscopic organisms. Jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders. The &quot;great vows&quot; (mahavrata) are prescribed for monks and &quot;limited vows&quot; (anuvrata) are prescribed for householders. In other words, the house-holders are encouraged to practice the five cardinal principles of non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, celibacy and non-possessiveness with their current practical limitations while the monks have to observe them very strictly. With consistent practice, it will be possible to overcome the limitations gradually, accelerating the spiritual progress.

===Christianity===
[[File:StThomasMount Theresa.JPG|thumb|180px|Statue of [[Mother Teresa]] in India]]
Altruism is central to the teachings of Jesus found in the [[Gospel]], especially in the [[Sermon on the Mount]] and the [[Sermon on the Plain]]. From biblical to medieval [[Christian traditions]], tensions between self-affirmation and other-regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of &quot;disinterested love&quot;, as in the [[Paul the Apostle|Pauline]] phrase &quot;love seeks not its own interests.&quot; In his book ''Indoctrination and Self-deception,'' Roderick Hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self-affirmation and altruism, by analysis of other-regard within creative individuation of the self, and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many. Love confirms others in their freedom, shuns propaganda and masks, assures others of its presence, and is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others, but by each person's experience and practice from within. As in practical arts, the presence and meaning of love becomes validated and grasped not by words and reflections alone, but in the making of the connection.

[[St Thomas Aquinas]] in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', II:II Quaestio 25, Article 4 states that we should love our neighbour more than our ourselves. His interpretation of the Pauline phrase is that we should seek the common good more than the private good, but this is because the common good is a more desirable good for the individual. St Thomas interprets 'You should love your neighbour as yourself' from [[Leviticus]] 19 and Matthew 22 as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others. However, he thinks we should love God more than ourselves and our neighbours, and more than our bodily life—since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude: a more desirable thing than bodily well being. In coining the word Altruism, as stated above, [[Auguste Comte|Comte]] was probably opposing this Thomistic doctrine, which is present in some theological schools within Catholicism.

Many biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of God. 1 John 4 states that for one to love God one must love his fellowman, and that hatred of one's fellowman is the same as hatred of God. [[Thomas Jay Oord]] has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love. An altruistic action is not always a loving action. Oord defines altruism as acting for the other's good, and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one's own good when the other's demands undermine overall well-being.

German philosopher [[Max Scheler]] distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak. One way is a sincere expression of Christian love, &quot;motivated by a powerful feeling of security, strength, and inner salvation, of the invincible fullness of one’s own life and existence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scheler|first=Max|title=Ressentiment|year=1961|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another way is merely &quot;one of the many modern substitutes for love, ... nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other people’s business.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scheler|first=Max|title=Ressentiment|year=1961|pages=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its worst, Scheler says, &quot;love for the small, the poor, the weak, and the oppressed is really disguised hatred, repressed envy, an impulse to detract, etc., directed against the opposite phenomena: wealth, strength, power, largesse.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scheler|first=Max|title=Ressentiment|year=1961|pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
In [[Islam]], the concept 'īthār' (altruism) is the notion of 'preferring others to oneself'. For Sufis, this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of one's own concerns, where concern for others is rooted to be a demand made by Allah on the human body, considered to be property of Allah alone. The importance lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good; [[Islam]] considers those practicing īthār as abiding by the highest degree of nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = M| title = Key Concepts in the Practice of Sufism: Emerald Hills of the Heart| year = 2004| publisher = Fountain| location = Rutherford, N.J.| isbn = 1-932099-75-1| pages = 10–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is similar to the notion of chivalry, but unlike that European concept, in i'thar attention is focused on everything in existence. A constant concern for [[Allah]] (i.e. God) results in a careful attitude towards people, animals, and other things in this world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neusner2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Neusner| first = Jacob Eds| title = Altruism in World Religions| year = 2005| publisher = Georgetown Univ. Press| location = Washington, D.C.| isbn = 1-58901-065-5| pages = 79–80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This concept was emphasized by Sufis of Islam like [[Rabia al-Adawiyya]] who paid attention to the difference between dedication to [[Allah]] (i.e. God) and dedication to people. Thirteenth-century Turkish Sufi poet [[Yunus Emre]] explained this philosophy as &quot;Yaratılanı severiz, Yaratandan ötürü&quot; or ''We love the creature, because of The Creator.'' For many Muslims, i'thar must be practiced as a religious obligation during specific Islamic holidays. However, i'thar is also still an Islamic ideal to which all Muslims should strive to adhere at all times.

===Judaism===
Judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation. The famous Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author2=Ben Zion Bokser |last1=Kook |first1=Abraham Isaac| title = Abraham Isaac Kook: The lights of penitence, The moral principles, Lights of holiness, essays, letters, and poems| year = 1978| publisher = Paulist Press| isbn = 978-0-8091-2159-5| pages = 135–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is defined as [[Corporate welfare|bestowal]], or giving, which is the intention of altruism. This can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or God. [[Kabbalah]] defines God as the force of giving in [[existence]]. Rabbi [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]] in particular focused on the 'purpose of creation' and how the will of God was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Luzzatto| first = Moshe Ḥayyim| title = The way of God| year = 1997| publisher = Feldheim Publishers| isbn = 978-0-87306-769-0| pages = 37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Kabbalah developed by Rabbi [[Yehuda Ashlag]], in his writings about the future generation, focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ashlag| first = Yehuda| title = Building the Future Society| url = http://www.kabbalah.info/eng/content/view/frame/3811?/eng/content/view/full/3811&amp;main| year = 2006| publisher = Laitman Kabbalah Publishers| location = Thornhill, Canada| isbn = 965-7065-34-8| pages = 120–130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation, and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism, love for one another. Ashlag focused on society and its relation to [[divinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ashlag| first = Yehuda| title = Building the Future Society| url = http://www.kabbalah.info/eng/content/view/frame/3811?/eng/content/view/full/3811&amp;main| year = 2006| publisher = Laitman Kabbalah Publishers| location = Thornhill, Canada| isbn = 965-7065-34-8| pages = 175–180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sikhism===
Altruism is essential to the Sikh religion. 
The central faith in Sikhism is that the greatest deed any one can do is to imbibe and live the godly qualities like love, affection, sacrifice, patience, harmony, truthfulness.
The fifth Nanak, Guru Arjun Dev Sacrificed his life to uphold 22 Carats of pure truth, the greatest gift to humanity, the Guru Granth. The Ninth Nanak, Guru Tegh Bahadur Sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity. In the late 17th century, [[Guru Gobind Singh]] Ji (the tenth [[guru]] in Sikhism), was in war with the [[Moghul]] rulers to protect the people of different faiths, when a fellow Sikh, [[Bhai Kanhaiya]], attended the troops of the enemy. He gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield. Some of the enemy began to fight again and some Sikh warriors were annoyed by Bhai Kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy. Sikh soldiers brought Bhai Kanhaiya before Guru Gobind Singh Ji, and complained of his action that they considered counterproductive to their struggle on the battlefield.
&quot;What were you doing, and why?&quot; asked the Guru. &quot;I was giving water to the wounded because I saw your face in all of them,&quot; replied Bhai Kanhaiya.
The Guru responded, &quot;Then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds. You were practicing what you were coached in the house of the Guru.&quot;

It was under the tutelage of the Guru that Bhai Kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism. This volunteer corps still to date is engaged in doing good to others and trains new volunteering recruits for doing the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = O. P. Ralhan| title = The great gurus of the Sikhs| year = 1997| publisher = Anmol Publications Pvt Ltd.| location = New Delhi| isbn = 81-7488-479-3| page = 253 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
[[Advaita Vedanta]] differs from the view that karma is a law of cause and effect but instead additionally hold that karma is mediated by the will of a personal supreme god. This view of karma is in contradiction to [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and other [[Indian religions]] that do view karma as a law of cause and effect.

[[Swami Sivananda]], an [[Advaita]] scholar, reiterates the same views in his commentary synthesising Vedanta views on the [[Brahma Sutras]], a Vedantic text. In his commentary on Chapter 3 of the Brahma Sutras, Sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short-lived, and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed. Hence, karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to one's merit. Furthermore, one cannot argue that karma generates [[apurva]] or [[Merit (Buddhism)|punya]], which gives fruit. Since apurva is non-sentient, it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as a god. It cannot independently bestow reward or punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Sivananda, Swami. ''Phaladhikaranam, Topic 8'', Sutras 38–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
{{main|Altruism (ethics)}}

There exists a wide range of philosophical views on man's obligations or motivations to act altruistically. Proponents of [[Altruism (ethics)|ethical altruism]] maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically. The opposing view is [[ethical egoism]], which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own self-interest. Both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with [[utilitarianism]], which is the view that every individual's well-being (including one's own) is of equal moral importance.

A related concept in [[descriptive ethics]] is [[psychological egoism]], the thesis that humans always act in their own self-interest and that true altruism is impossible. [[Rational egoism]] is the view that [[rationality]] consists in acting in one's self-interest (without specifying how this affects one's moral obligations).

'''Ayn Rand''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|n|_|ˈ|r|æ|n|d}};&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|p=71}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; born '''Alisa Zinov'yevna Rosenbaum'''; {{OldStyleDate|February 2|1905|January 20}} – March 6, 1982) was an [[United States|American]] [[novelist]], philosopher,&lt;!-- DO NOT REMOVE WITHOUT CONSENSUS --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Den Uyl|Rasmussen|1986|p=x}}; {{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|pp=1–2}}; {{harvnb|Kukathas|1998|p=55}}; {{harvnb|Badhwar|Long|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; playwright, and screenwriter. She is known for her two best-selling novels, ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' and ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', and for developing a philosophical system she called [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]]. Born and educated in [[Russian American|Russia]], Rand moved to the United States in 1926. She had a play produced on Broadway in 1935–1936. After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful in America, she achieved fame with her 1943 novel, ''[[The Fountainhead]]''.

In 1957, she published her best-known work, the novel ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''. Afterward, she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own magazines and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 1982. Rand advocated [[reason]] as the only means of acquiring [[knowledge]] and rejected faith and religion. She supported [[rational egoism|rational]] and [[ethical egoism]], and rejected [[ethical altruism]]. In politics, she condemned the [[initiation of force]] as immoral&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barry|1987|p=122}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=309–314}}; {{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=298}}; {{harvnb|Gotthelf|2000|p=91}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  opposed [[collectivism]] and [[statism]] as well as [[anarchism]], instead supporting a [[minarchist]] [[limited government]] and ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]], which she believed to be the only social system that protected [[individual rights]]. In art, Rand promoted [[romantic realism]]. She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her, except for some [[Aristotelians]] and [[classical liberals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|1977|pp=18–20}}; {{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|pp=12, 118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary critics received Rand's fiction with mixed reviews,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladstein 117-119&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|pp=117–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; and academia generally ignored or rejected her philosophy. The [[Objectivist movement]] attempts to spread her ideas, both to the public and in academic settings.&lt;ref name=&quot;reception&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been a significant influence among [[libertarians]] and [[American conservatives]].&lt;ref name=&quot;politicalinfluence&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=4}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|pp=107–108, 124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
===Early life===
Rand was born Alisa Zinov'yevna Rosenbaum ({{lang-ru|Али́са Зиновьевна Розенбаум}}) on February 2, 1905, to a [[Russian Jew]]ish [[bourgeois]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; family living in [[Saint Petersburg]]. She was the eldest of the three daughters of Zinovy Zakharovich Rosenbaum and his wife, Anna Borisovna (née Kaplan), largely non-observant [[Jews]]. Zinovy Rosenbaum was a successful pharmacist and businessman, eventually owning a pharmacy and the building in which it was located.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=3–5}}; {{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=2–3}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a passion for the liberal arts, Rand found school unchallenging, and said she began writing screenplays at the age of eight and novels at the age of ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|series=The Tomorrow Show|credit=Tom Snyder|network=NBC|airdate=July 2, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was twelve at the time of the [[February Revolution]] of 1917, during which she favored [[Alexander Kerensky]] over [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas II]].

The subsequent [[October Revolution]] and the rule of the [[Bolshevik]]s under [[Vladimir Lenin]] disrupted the comfortable life the family had previously enjoyed. Her father’s business was confiscated and the family displaced. They fled to the [[Crimean Peninsula]], which was initially under control of the [[White Army]] during the [[Russian Civil War]]. She later recalled that, while in high school, she determined that she was an [[atheist]] and that she valued [[reason]] above any other human virtue. After graduating from high school in the Crimea at 16, Rand returned with her family to Petrograd (as Saint Petersburg was renamed at that time), where they faced desperate conditions, on occasion nearly starving.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=35–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=14–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spb 06-2012 University Embankment 06.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The Twelve Collegia of what was then Petrograd State University|Rand completed a three-year program at [[Petrograd State University]].]]
After the Russian Revolution, universities were opened to women, allowing Rand to be in the first group of women to enroll at [[Petrograd State University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she studied in the department of [[social pedagogy]], majoring in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the university she was introduced to the writings of [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1999|pp=5–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; who would be her greatest influence and counter-influence, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=41}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=451–460}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third figure whose philosophical works she studied heavily was [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=17–18, 22–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Able to read French, German and Russian, Rand also discovered the writers [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Edmond Rostand]], and [[Friedrich Schiller]], who became her perennial favorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=17, 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with many other &quot;bourgeois&quot; students, Rand was purged from the university shortly before graduating. However, after complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists, many of the purged students were allowed to complete their work and graduate,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=47}}; {{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Rand did in October 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1999|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; She subsequently studied for a year at the State [[Technicum]] for Screen Arts in Leningrad. For one of her assignments, she wrote an essay about the [[Polish people|Polish]] actress [[Pola Negri]], which became her first published work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heller49-50&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time she had decided her professional surname for writing would be ''Rand'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly as a [[Cyrillic]] contraction of her birth surname,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=7}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she adopted the first name ''Ayn'', either from a [[Finnish language|Finnish]] name or from the [[Hebrew]] word {{lang|he| עין}} (''ayin'', meaning &quot;eye&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Rand said the origin of ''Ayn'' was Finnish {{harv|Rand|1995|p=40}}, but some biographical sources question this, suggesting it may come from a Hebrew nickname. {{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=55–57}} provides a detailed discussion.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arrival in the United States ===
[[File:Pola Negri by Ayn Rand cover.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A brown book cover with black-and-white drawings and text in Russian. The drawing on the left is a portrait of a woman with dark hair; the drawing on the right is of skyscrapers.|Cover of Rand's first published work, a 2,500-word monograph on ''femme fatale'' [[Pola Negri]] published in 1925.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heller49-50&quot;/&gt;]]
In the fall of 1925, Rand was granted a [[Visa (document)|visa]] to visit American relatives. She departed on January 17, 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she arrived in New York City on February 19, 1926, she was so impressed with the skyline of [[Manhattan]] that she cried what she later called &quot;tears of splendor&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intent on staying in the United States to become a screenwriter, she lived for a few months with relatives in [[Chicago]], one of whom owned a movie theater and allowed her to watch dozens of films for free. She then set out for [[Hollywood, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=57–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Rand struggled in Hollywood and took odd jobs to pay her basic living expenses. A chance meeting with famed director [[Cecil B. DeMille]] led to a job as an [[extra (drama)|extra]] in his film ''[[The King of Kings (1927 film)|The King of Kings]]'' as well as subsequent work as a junior screenwriter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=34–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; While working on ''The King of Kings'', she met an aspiring young actor, Frank O'Connor; the two were married on April 15, 1929. Rand [[United States nationality law#Naturalization|became an American citizen]] in 1931. Taking various jobs during the 1930s to support her writing, she worked for a time as the head of the costume department at [[RKO]] Studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=35–40}}; {{harvnb|Paxton|1998|pp=74, 81, 84}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made several attempts to bring her parents and sisters to the United States, but they were unable to acquire permission to emigrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=96–98}}; {{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=43–44, 52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early fiction===
{{See also|Night of January 16th|We the Living|Anthem (novella)}}

Rand's first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay ''[[Red Pawn]]'' to [[Universal Studios]] in 1932, although it was never produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=40, 42}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the courtroom drama ''[[Night of January 16th]]'', first produced by [[E.E. Clive]] in Hollywood in 1934 and then successfully reopened on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] in 1935. Each night the &quot;jury&quot; was selected from members of the audience, and one of the two different endings, depending on the jury's &quot;verdict&quot;, would then be performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=76, 92}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, [[Paramount Pictures]] produced a movie loosely based on the play. Rand did not participate in the production and was highly critical of the result.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=78}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand's first novel, the semi-autobiographical ''[[We the Living]]'', was published in 1936. Set in [[Soviet Russia]], it focused on the struggle between the individual and the state. In a 1959 foreword to the novel, Rand stated that ''We the Living'' &quot;is as near to an autobiography as I will ever write. It is not an autobiography in the literal, but only in the intellectual sense. The plot is invented, the background is not...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rand |first=Ayn |chapter=Foreword |title=We the Living |location=New York |publisher=Dutton |page=xviii |isbn=0-525-94054-5 |oclc=32780458 |edition=60th Anniversary |year=1995 |origyear=1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial sales were slow and the American publisher let it go out of print,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; although European editions continued to sell.&lt;ref&gt;Ralston, Richard E. &quot;Publishing ''We the Living''&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2004|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the success of her later novels, Rand was able to release a revised version in 1959 that has since sold over three million copies.&lt;ref&gt;Ralston, Richard E. &quot;Publishing ''We the Living''&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2004|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without Rand's knowledge or permission, the novel was made into a pair of Italian films, ''Noi vivi'' and ''Addio, Kira'', in 1942. Rediscovered in the 1960s, these films were re-edited into a new version which was approved by Rand and re-released as ''[[We the Living (film)|We the Living]]'' in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paxton|1998|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her novella ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]'' was written during a break from the writing of her next major novel, ''The Fountainhead''. It presents a vision of a [[dystopian]] future world in which [[totalitarian]] collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that even the word 'I' has been forgotten and replaced with 'we'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=50}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in England in 1938, but Rand initially could not find an American publisher. As with ''We the Living'', Rand's later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946, which has sold more than 3.5 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;Ralston, Richard E. &quot;Publishing ''Anthem''&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2005a|pp=24–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Fountainhead'' and political activism===
{{See also|The Fountainhead|The Fountainhead (film)}}
During the 1940s, Rand became politically active. Both she and her husband worked full-time in volunteer positions for the 1940 presidential campaign of Republican [[Wendell Willkie]]. This work led to Rand's first public speaking experiences, including fielding the sometimes hostile questions from New York City audiences who had just viewed pro-Willkie [[newsreels]], an experience she greatly enjoyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; This activity also brought her into contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to free-market capitalism. She became friends with journalist [[Henry Hazlitt]] and his wife, and Hazlitt introduced her to the [[Austrian School]] economist [[Ludwig von Mises]]. Despite her philosophical differences with them, Rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout her career, and both of them expressed admiration for her. Once Mises referred to Rand as &quot;the most courageous man in America&quot;, a compliment that particularly pleased her because he said &quot;man&quot; instead of &quot;woman&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=114}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=249}}; {{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=188–189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand also developed a friendship with libertarian writer [[Isabel Paterson]]. Rand questioned the well-informed Paterson about American history and politics long into the night during their numerous meetings and gave Paterson ideas for her only nonfiction book, ''[[The God of the Machine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=75–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand's first major success as a writer came with ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' in 1943, a romantic and philosophical novel that she wrote over a period of seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=61–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel centers on an uncompromising young architect named [[Howard Roark]] and his struggle against what Rand described as &quot;second-handers&quot;— those who attempt to live through others, placing others above themselves. It was rejected by twelve publishers before finally being accepted by the [[Bobbs-Merrill Company]] on the insistence of editor Archibald Ogden, who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=58–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; While completing the novel, Rand was prescribed [[Benzedrine]], a brand of [[amphetamine]], to fight fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the finished novel, but when the book was done, she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks' rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her continued use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=178}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=304–305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Fountainhead'' eventually became a worldwide success, bringing Rand fame and financial security.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doherty|2007|p=149}}; {{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=180–181}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, Rand sold the rights for a [[The Fountainhead (film)|film version]] to [[Warner Bros.]], and she returned to Hollywood to write the screenplay. Finishing her work on that screenplay, she was hired by producer [[Hal Wallis]] as a screenwriter and script-doctor. Her work for Wallis included the screenplays for the [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated ''[[Love Letters (1945 film)|Love Letters]]'' and ''[[You Came Along]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=68–80}}; {{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=183–198}}&lt;/ref&gt; This role gave Rand time to work on other projects, including a planned nonfiction treatment of her philosophy to be called ''The Moral Basis of Individualism''. Although the planned book was never completed, a condensed version was published as an essay titled &quot;The Only Path to Tomorrow&quot;, in the January 1944 edition of ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=112}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wikisource|Ayn Rand's testimony before the House of Representatives Committee on Un-American Activities}}
Rand extended her involvement with free-market and [[anti-communist]] activism while working in Hollywood. She became involved with the [[Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals]], a Hollywood anti-Communist group, and wrote articles on the group's behalf. She also joined the anti-Communist [[American Writers Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=100–101, 123}}&lt;/ref&gt; A visit by Isabel Paterson to meet with Rand's California associates led to a final falling out between the two when Paterson made comments that Rand saw as rude to valued political allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=130–131}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=214–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, during the [[Second Red Scare]], Rand testified as a &quot;friendly witness&quot; before the United States [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]. Her testimony described the disparity between her personal experiences in the [[Soviet Union]] and the portrayal of it in the 1944 film ''[[Song of Russia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayhew|2005b|pp=91–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand argued that the film grossly misrepresented conditions in the Soviet Union, portraying life there as being much better and happier than it actually was.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayhew|2005b|pp=188–189}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wanted to also criticize the lauded 1946 film ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'' for what she interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world, but she was not allowed to testify about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked after the hearings about her feelings on the effectiveness of the investigations, Rand described the process as &quot;futile&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayhew|2005b|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After several delays, the film version of ''The Fountainhead'' was released in 1949. Although it used Rand's screenplay with minimal alterations, she &quot;disliked the movie from beginning to end&quot;, complaining about its editing, acting, and other elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Atlas Shrugged'' and Objectivism===
{{See also|Atlas Shrugged|Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist movement}}
In the years following the publication of ''The Fountainhead'', Rand received numerous letters from readers, some of whom it profoundly influenced. In 1951 Rand moved from Los Angeles to New York City, where she gathered a group of these admirers around her. This group (jokingly designated &quot;The Collective&quot;) included future [[Federal Reserve Chairman]] [[Alan Greenspan]], a young psychology student named Nathan Blumenthal (later [[Nathaniel Branden]]) and his wife [[Barbara Branden|Barbara]], and Barbara's cousin [[Leonard Peikoff]]. At first the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with Rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy. Later she began allowing them to read the drafts of her new novel, ''Atlas Shrugged'', as the manuscript pages were written. In 1954 Rand's close relationship with the younger Nathaniel Branden turned into a romantic affair, with the consent of their spouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=256–264, 331–343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Atlas Shrugged'', published in 1957, was considered Rand's ''[[magnum opus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=113}}; {{harvnb|Mayhew|2005b|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand described the theme of the novel as &quot;the role of the mind in man's existence—and, as a corollary, the demonstration of a new moral philosophy: the morality of rational self-interest.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Salmieri, Gregory. &quot;''Atlas Shrugged'' on the Role of the Mind in Man's Existence&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2009|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; It advocates the core tenets of Rand's philosophy of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] and expresses her concept of human achievement. The plot involves a [[dystopia]]n United States in which the most creative industrialists, scientists and artists go on [[strike action|strike]] against an oppressive government that is a caricature of communism, and retreat to a mountainous hideaway where they build an independent free economy. The novel's hero and leader of the strike, [[John Galt]], describes the strike as &quot;stopping the motor of the world&quot; by withdrawing the minds of the individuals most contributing to the nation's wealth and achievement. With this fictional strike, Rand intended to illustrate that without the efforts of the rational and productive, the economy would collapse and society would fall apart.

Despite many negative reviews, ''Atlas Shrugged'' became an international bestseller, and in an interview with [[Mike Wallace (journalist)|Mike Wallace]], Rand declared herself &quot;the most creative thinker alive&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing the novel, Rand fell into a severe depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=178}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=303–306}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Atlas Shrugged'' was Rand's last completed work of fiction; a turning point in her life, it marked the end of Rand's career as a novelist and the beginning of her role as a popular philosopher.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASturningpoint&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2000|p=28}}; {{harvnb|Younkins|2007|p=1}}; {{harvnb|Baker|1987|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958 Nathaniel Branden established Nathaniel Branden Lectures, later incorporated as the [[Nathaniel Branden Institute]] (NBI), to promote Rand's philosophy. Collective members gave lectures for NBI and wrote articles for [[Objectivist periodicals]] that she edited. Rand later published some of these articles in book form. Critics, including some former NBI students and Branden himself, have described the culture of NBI as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for Rand, with some describing NBI or the [[Objectivist movement]] itself as a [[cult]] or religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|pp=105–106}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=232–233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics, from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair, and some of her followers mimicked her preferences, wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=236–237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand was unimpressed with many of the NBI students&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=303}}&lt;/ref&gt; and held them to strict standards, sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doherty|2007|pp=237–238}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=329}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some former NBI students believe the extent of these behaviors has been exaggerated, with the problem being concentrated among Rand's closest followers in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doherty|2007|p=235}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Rand developed and promoted her Objectivist philosophy through her nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at institutions such as [[Yale]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=315–316}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Harvard]], and [[MIT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received an honorary doctorate from [[Lewis &amp; Clark College]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|p=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also began delivering annual lectures at the [[Ford Hall Forum]], responding afterward to questions from the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; During these speeches and Q&amp;A sessions, she often took controversial stances on political and social issues of the day. These included supporting abortion rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=320–321}}&lt;/ref&gt; opposing the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[military draft]] (but condemning many [[draft dodgers]] as &quot;bums&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=228–229, 265}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=352}}&lt;/ref&gt; supporting [[Israel]] in the [[Yom Kippur War]] of 1973 against a coalition of Arab nations as &quot;civilized men fighting savages&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|2005|p=96}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonists]] had the right to take land from [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=266}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=391}}&lt;/ref&gt; and calling [[homosexuality]] &quot;immoral&quot; and &quot;disgusting&quot;, while also advocating the repeal of all laws about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=362, 519}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also endorsed several [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidates for President of the United States, most strongly [[Barry Goldwater]] in [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964]], whose candidacy she promoted in several articles for ''The Objectivist Newsletter''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=204–206}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=322–323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964 Nathaniel Branden began an affair with the young actress Patrecia Scott,&lt;!--note: spelling is correct, please do not remove--&gt; whom he later married. Nathaniel and Barbara Branden kept the affair hidden from Rand. When she learned of it in 1968, though her romantic relationship with Branden had already ended,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand terminated her relationship with both Brandens, which led to the closure of NBI.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=344–358}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand published an article in ''The Objectivist'' repudiating Nathaniel Branden for dishonesty and other &quot;irrational behavior in his private life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=378–379}}&lt;/ref&gt; Branden later apologized in an interview to &quot;every student of Objectivism&quot; for &quot;perpetuating the Ayn Rand mystique&quot; and for &quot;contributing to that dreadful atmosphere of intellectual repressiveness that pervades the Objectivist movement.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=411}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent years, Rand and several more of her closest associates parted company.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=386–389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand underwent surgery for [[lung cancer]] in 1974 after decades of heavy smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=391–393}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1976, she retired from writing her newsletter and, despite her initial objections, was persuaded to allow Evva Pryor, a consultant from her attorney's office, to sign her up for [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McConnell|2010|pp=520–521}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1970s her activities within the Objectivist movement declined, especially after the death of her husband on November 9, 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=392–395}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of her final projects was work on a never-completed television adaptation of ''Atlas Shrugged''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand died of [[heart failure]] on March 6, 1982, at her home in New York City,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=410}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was interred in the [[Kensico Cemetery]], [[Valhalla, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=405, 410}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand's funeral was attended by some of her prominent followers, including [[Alan Greenspan]]. A six-foot floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|p=403}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her will, Rand named [[Leonard Peikoff]] the heir to her estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
{{Objectivist movement}}{{Main|Objectivism (Ayn Rand)}}
Rand called her philosophy &quot;Objectivism,&quot; describing its essence as &quot;the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1992|pp=1170–1171}}&lt;/ref&gt; She considered Objectivism a [[systematic philosophy]] and laid out positions on [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[ethics]], [[political philosophy]] and [[aesthetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=2–3}}; {{harvnb|Den Uyl|Rasmussen|1986|p=224}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|Sciabarra|1999|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In metaphysics, Rand supported [[philosophical realism]], and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism, including all forms of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Den Uyl, Douglas J. &amp; Rasmussen, Douglas B. &quot;Ayn Rand's Realism&quot;. In {{harvnb|Den Uyl|Rasmussen|1986|pp=3–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[epistemology]], she considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception, the validity of which she considered [[axiom]]atic,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=38–39}}; {{harvnb|Gotthelf|2000|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[reason]], which she described as &quot;the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man's senses.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; She rejected all claims of non-perceptual or ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' knowledge, including &quot;'instinct,' 'intuition,' 'revelation,' or any form of 'just knowing.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1982|pp=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her ''[[Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology]]'', Rand presented a theory of concept formation and rejected the [[analytic–synthetic dichotomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Salmieri|Gotthelf|2005|p=1997}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|pp=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ethics, Rand argued for [[rational egoism|rational]] and [[ethical egoism]] (rational self-interest), as the guiding moral principle. She said the individual should &quot;exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1989|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She referred to egoism as &quot;the virtue of selfishness&quot; in her [[The Virtue of Selfishness|book of that title]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Kukathas&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kukathas|1998|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which she presented her solution to the [[is-ought problem]] by describing a [[meta-ethical]] theory that based morality in the needs of &quot;man's survival ''qua'' man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=25}}; {{harvnb|Badhwar|Long|2010}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=207, 219}}&lt;/ref&gt; She condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Badhwar|Long|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and held that the [[initiation of force]] was evil and irrational, writing in ''Atlas Shrugged'' that &quot;Force and mind are opposites.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1992|p=1023}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=313–320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand's political philosophy emphasized [[individual rights]] (including [[Private property|property rights]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=350–352}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she considered ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]] the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on the protection of those rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gotthelf|2000|pp=91–92}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=379–380}}&lt;/ref&gt; She opposed [[statism]], which she understood to include [[theocracy]], [[absolute monarchy]], [[Nazism]], [[fascism]], [[communism]], [[democratic socialism]], and [[dictatorship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand believed that rights should be enforced by a constitutionally limited government.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although her political views are often classified as [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] or [[libertarian]], she preferred the term &quot;radical for capitalism.&quot; She worked with conservatives on political projects, but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=174–177, 209, 230–231}}; {{harvnb|Den Uyl|Rasmussen|1986|pp=225–226}}; {{harvnb|Doherty|2007|pp=189–190}}; {{harvnb|Branden|1986|p=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; She denounced libertarianism, which she associated with [[anarchism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|pp=266–267}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=268–269}}&lt;/ref&gt; She rejected anarchism as a naïve theory based in [[subjectivism]] that could only lead to collectivism in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|pp=280–281}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=371–372}}; {{harvnb|Merrill|1991|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand's aesthetics defined art as a &quot;selective re-creation of reality according to an artist's metaphysical value-judgments.&quot; According to Rand, art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be easily grasped, thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|pp=204–205}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a writer, the art form Rand focused on most closely was literature, where she considered [[romanticism]] to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human [[free will]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=428}}&lt;/ref&gt; She described her own approach to literature as &quot;[[romantic realism]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=207}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand acknowledged [[Aristotle]] as her greatest influence&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1992|p=1171}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remarked that in the [[history of philosophy]] she could only recommend &quot;three A's&quot; — Aristotle, [[Aquinas]], and Ayn Rand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sciabarra1995p12&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1959 interview with [[Mike Wallace (journalist)|Mike Wallace]], when asked where her philosophy came from, she responded, &quot;Out of my own mind, with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to Aristotle, the only philosopher who ever influenced me. I devised the rest of my philosophy myself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Podritske|Schwartz|2009|pp=174–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she also found early inspiration in [[Friedrich Nietzsche]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=42}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=16, 22}}; {{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|pp=100–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; and scholars have found indications of his influence in early notes from Rand's journals,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1997|p=21}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=24–25}}; {{harvnb|Sciabarra|1998|pp=136, 138–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; in passages from the first edition of ''We the Living'' (which Rand later revised),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Merrill|1991|pp=38–39}}; {{harvnb|Sciabarra|1998|p=135}}; Loiret-Prunet, Valerie. &quot;Ayn Rand and Feminist Synthesis: Rereading ''We the Living''&quot;.

In {{harvnb|Gladstein|Sciabarra|1999|p=313}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the time she wrote ''The Fountainhead'', Rand had turned against Nietzsche's ideas,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=41, 68}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=42}}; {{harvnb|Merrill|1991|pp=47–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=303–304}}; {{harvnb|Sciabarra|1998|pp=135, 137–138}}; Mayhew, Robert. &quot;''We the Living'' '36 and '59&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2004|p=205}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the philosophers Rand held in particular disdain was [[Immanuel Kant]], whom she referred to as a &quot;monster,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1971|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; although philosophers George Walsh&lt;ref name=&quot;Walsh&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Walsh|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Fred Seddon&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Seddon|2003|pp=63–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that she misinterpreted Kant and exaggerated their differences.

Rand said her most important contributions to philosophy were her &quot;theory of concepts, [her] ethics, and [her] discovery in politics that evil—the violation of rights—consists of the initiation of force.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|2005|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; She believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Return of the Primitive: The Anti-Industrial Revolution]] |chapter=The Left: Old and New |page=62 |isbn=0-452-01184-1 |oclc=39281836 |year=1999 |location=New York |publisher=Meridian |last=Rand |first=Ayn |others=Edited by Peter Schwartz}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating, &quot;I am not ''primarily'' an advocate of capitalism, but of egoism; and I am not ''primarily'' an advocate of egoism, but of reason. If one recognizes the supremacy of reason and applies it consistently, all the rest follows.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1971|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reviews===
During Rand's lifetime, her work evoked both extreme praise and condemnation. Rand's first novel, ''We the Living'', was admired by the literary critic [[H. L. Mencken]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1995|pp=10, 13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; her Broadway play ''Night of January 16th'' was both a critical and popular success,&lt;ref name=&quot;Branden 122-124&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=122–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Fountainhead'' was hailed by a reviewer in ''[[The New York Times]]'' as &quot;masterful&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pruette&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Lorine |last=Pruette |work=The New York Times |date=May 16, 1943 |title=Battle Against Evil |page=BR7 |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20610FD3D5C167B93C4A8178ED85F478485F9 |accessdate=April 15, 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110511114039/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20610FD3D5C167B93C4A8178ED85F478485F9 |archivedate=May 11, 2011 |deadurl=no}} Reprinted in {{cite book |title=Books of the Century |editor-first=Charles |editor-last=McGrath |year=1998 |location=New York |publisher=Times Books |isbn=0-8129-2965-9 |oclc=38439024 |pages=135–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand's novels were derided by some critics when they were first published as being long and melodramatic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladstein 117-119&quot;/&gt; However, they became [[bestseller]]s largely through word of mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paxton|1998|p=120}}; {{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first reviews Rand received were for ''Night of January 16th''. Reviews of the production were largely positive, but Rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Branden 122-124&quot;/&gt; Rand believed that her first novel, ''We the Living'', was not widely reviewed, but Rand scholar Michael S. Berliner says &quot;it was the most reviewed of any of her works&quot;, with approximately 125 different reviews being published in more than 200 publications. Overall these reviews were more positive than the reviews she received for her later work.&lt;ref&gt;Berliner, Michael S. &quot;Reviews of ''We the Living''&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2004|pp=147–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her 1938 novella ''Anthem'' received little attention from reviewers, both for its first publication in England and for subsequent re-issues.&lt;ref&gt;Berliner, Michael S. &quot;Reviews of ''Anthem''&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2005a|pp=55–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand's first bestseller, ''The Fountainhead'', received far fewer reviews than ''We the Living'', and reviewers' opinions were mixed.&lt;ref name=&quot;tfreviews&quot;&gt;Berliner, Michael S. &quot;''The Fountainhead'' Reviews&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2006|pp=77–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a positive review in ''The New York Times'' that Rand greatly appreciated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1995|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewer called Rand &quot;a writer of great power&quot; who wrote &quot;brilliantly, beautifully and bitterly&quot;, and stated that &quot;you will not be able to read this masterful book without thinking through some of the basic concepts of our time&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pruette&quot;/&gt; There were other positive reviews, but Rand dismissed most of them as either not understanding her message or as being from unimportant publications.&lt;ref name=&quot;tfreviews&quot;/&gt; Some negative reviews focused on the length of the novel,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladstein 117-119&quot;/&gt; such as one that called it &quot;a whale of a book&quot; and another that said &quot;anyone who is taken in by it deserves a stern lecture on paper-rationing&quot;. Other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and Rand's style &quot;offensively pedestrian&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tfreviews&quot;/&gt;

Rand's 1957 novel ''Atlas Shrugged'' was widely reviewed, and many of the reviews were strongly negative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladstein 117-119&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;asreviews&quot;&gt;Berliner, Michael S. &quot;The ''Atlas Shrugged'' Reviews&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2009|pp=133–137}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[National Review]]'', conservative author [[Whittaker Chambers]] called the book &quot;sophomoric&quot; and &quot;remarkably silly&quot;. He described the tone of the book as &quot;shrillness without reprieve&quot; and accused Rand of supporting a godless system (which he related to that of the [[Religion in the Soviet Union|Soviets]]), claiming &quot;From almost any page of ''Atlas Shrugged'', a voice can be heard, from painful necessity, commanding: 'To a gas chamber—go!{{' &quot;}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chambers |first=Whittaker |authorlink=Whittaker Chambers |title=Big Sister is Watching You |journal=[[National Review]] |pages=594–596 |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/222482/big-sister-watching-you/flashback |date=December 8, 1957 |accessdate=April 15, 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110511214136/http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/222482/big-sister-watching-you/flashback |archivedate=May 11, 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Atlas Shrugged'' received positive reviews from a few publications, including praise from the noted book reviewer [[John Chamberlain (journalist)|John Chamberlain]],&lt;ref name=&quot;asreviews&quot;/&gt; but Rand scholar [[Mimi Reisel Gladstein]] later wrote that &quot;reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest put-downs&quot;, calling it &quot;execrable claptrap&quot; and &quot;a nightmare&quot;; they said it was &quot;written out of hate&quot; and showed &quot;remorseless hectoring and prolixity&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladstein 117-119&quot;/&gt; Author [[Flannery O'Connor]] wrote in a letter to a friend that &quot;The fiction of Ayn Rand is as low as you can get re fiction.

She faced intense opposition from [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]] and other contributors for the ''[[National Review]]'' magazine. They published numerous criticisms in the 1950s and 1960s by [[Whittaker Chambers]], [[Garry Wills]], and [[M. Stanton Evans]]. Nevertheless, her influence among conservatives forced Buckley and other ''National Review'' contributors to reconsider how traditional notions of virtue and Christianity could be integrated with support for capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political figures who cite Rand as an influence are usually conservatives (often members of the United States Republican Party),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doherty|2009|pp=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite Rand taking some positions that are atypical for conservatives, such as being [[pro-choice]] and an atheist.&lt;ref name=&quot;MJones&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://motherjones.com/media/2009/07/and-rand-played |title=And the Rand Played On |first=Amy |last=Benfer |work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |date=July/August 2009 |accessdate=April 15, 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110503215311/http://motherjones.com/media/2009/07/and-rand-played |archivedate=May 3, 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1987 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' referred to her as the [[Reagan administration]]'s &quot;novelist laureate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; Republican [[United States Congress|Congressmen]] and conservative [[pundits]] have acknowledged her influence on their lives and recommended her novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=124}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=xi}}; {{harvnb|Doherty|2009|p=51}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic reaction===
During Rand's lifetime her work received little attention from academic scholars.&lt;ref name=&quot;reception&quot;/&gt; When the first academic book about Rand's philosophy appeared in 1971, its author declared writing about Rand &quot;a treacherous undertaking&quot; that could lead to &quot;guilt by association&quot; for taking her seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|1977|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few articles about Rand's ideas appeared in academic journals before her death in 1982, many of them in ''[[The Personalist]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladstein115&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these was &quot;On the Randian Argument&quot; by libertarian philosopher [[Robert Nozick]], who argued that her [[meta-ethical]] argument is unsound and fails to solve the [[is–ought problem]] posed by [[David Hume]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=On the Randian Argument |last=Nozick |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Nozick |journal=[[The Personalist]] |date=Spring 1971 |volume=52 |pages=282–304}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some responses to Nozick by other academic philosophers were also published in ''The Personalist'' arguing that Nozick misstated Rand's case.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladstein115&quot; /&gt; Academic consideration of Rand as a literary figure during her life was even more limited. Academic Mimi Gladstein was unable to find any scholarly articles about Rand's novels when she began researching her in 1973, and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2003|pp=373–374, 379–381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Rand's death, interest in her work has gradually increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|pp=114–122}}; {{harvnb|Salmieri|Gotthelf|2005|p=1995}}; {{cite journal |last=McLemee |first=Scott |url=http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9909/rand.html |title=The Heirs Of Ayn Rand: Has Objectivism Gone Subjective? |journal=[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]] |date=September 1999 |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=45–55 |accessdate=April 15, 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110515004459/http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9909/rand.html |archivedate=May 15, 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Jennifer Burns has identified &quot;three overlapping waves&quot; of scholarly interest in Rand, the most recent of which is &quot;an explosion of scholarship&quot; since the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=295–296}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, few universities currently include Rand or Objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area, with many literature and philosophy departments dismissing her as a pop culture phenomenon rather than a subject for serious study.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gladstein, [[Chris Matthew Sciabarra]], [[Allan Gotthelf]], [[Edwin A. Locke]] and [[Tara Smith (philosopher)|Tara Smith]] have taught her work in academic institutions. Sciabarra co-edits the ''[[Journal of Ayn Rand Studies]]'', a nonpartisan [[peer-reviewed journal]] dedicated to the study of Rand's philosophical and literary work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 Gotthelf helped found the Ayn Rand Society with George Walsh and David Kelley, and has been active in sponsoring seminars about Rand and her ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gotthelf|2000|pp=2, 25}}; {{cite journal |first=William |last=Thomas |title=Ayn Rand Through Two Lenses |journal=Navigator |date=April 2000 |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=15–19 |url=http://www.atlassociety.org/on-ayn-rand-gotthelf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith has written several academic books and papers on Rand's ideas, including ''Ayn Rand's Normative Ethics: The Virtuous Egoist'', a volume on Rand's ethical theory published by [[Cambridge University Press]].

Rand scholars Douglas Den Uyl and [[Douglas B.

In {{harvnb|Den Uyl|Rasmussen|1986|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[The Literary Encyclopedia (English)|Literary Encyclopedia]]'' entry for Rand written in 2001, [[John David Lewis]] declared that &quot;Rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lewis |first=John David |authorlink=John David Lewis |url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&amp;UID=3705 |work=[[The Literary Encyclopedia (English)|The Literary Encyclopedia]] |title=Ayn Rand |accessdate=August 2, 2009 |date=October 20, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1999 interview in the ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]],'' Sciabarra commented, &quot;I know they laugh at Rand&quot;, while forecasting a growth of interest in her work in the academic community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sharlet |first=Jeff |authorlink=Jeff Sharlet (writer) |work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Ayn-Rand-Has-Finally-Caught/20237/ |title=Ayn Rand Has Finally Caught the Attention of Scholars |date=April 9, 1999 |volume=45 |issue=31 |pages=A17–A18 |accessdate=April 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Libertarian philosopher [[Michael Huemer]] has argued that very few people find Rand's ideas convincing, especially her ethics,&lt;ref name=&quot;whyrand&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Huemer |url=http://www.cato-unbound.org/2010/01/22/michael-huemer/why-ayn-rand-some-alternate-answers |title=Why Ayn Rand?

Thus, ''Atlas Shrugged'' outsells not only the works of other philosophers of [[classical liberalism]] such as [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], or [[Frederic Bastiat]], but also Rand's own non-fiction works.&lt;ref name=&quot;whyrand&quot;/&gt;

Political scientist [[Charles Murray (author)|Charles Murray]], while praising Rand's literary accomplishments, criticizes her claim that her only &quot;philosophical debt&quot; was to Aristotle, instead asserting that her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as [[John Locke]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. According to Murray, &quot;By insisting that Objectivism had sprung full blown from her own mind, with just a little help from Aristotle, Rand was being childish, as well as out of touch with reality.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.claremont.org/publications/crb/id.1708/article_detail.asp |publisher=The Claremont Institute |title=Who is Ayn Rand? |first=Charles |last=Murray |year=2010 |accessdate=December 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Rand maintained that Objectivism was an integrated philosophical system, philosopher Robert H. Bass has argued that her central ethical ideas are inconsistent and contradictory to her central political ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert H. |last=Bass |title=Egoism versus Rights |work=[[The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies]] |volume=7 |issue=2 |date=Spring 2006 |pages=329–349 |url=http://aynrandstudies.com/jars/archives/jars7-2/jars7_2rbass1.pdf |archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20121105111109/http://www.aynrandstudies.com/jars/archives/jars7-2/jars7_2rbass1.pdf |archivedate=November 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Objectivist movement===
{{Main|Objectivist movement}}
In 1985, Rand's heir Leonard Peikoff established the [[Ayn Rand Institute]], a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting Rand's ideas and works. In 1990, philosopher [[David Kelley]] founded the Institute for Objectivist Studies, now known as [[The Atlas Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=280–281}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|pp=19, 114}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 historian John McCaskey organized the Anthem Foundation for Objectivist Scholarship, which provides grants for scholarly work on Objectivism in academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charitable foundation of [[BB&amp;T Corporation]] has also given grants for teaching Rand's ideas or works. The [[University of Texas at Austin]], the [[University of Pittsburgh]], and [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] are among the schools that have received grants. In some cases these grants have been controversial due to their requiring research or teaching related to Rand.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|pp=116–117}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alain Connes''' ({{IPA-fr|alɛ̃ kɔn|lang}}; born 1 April 1947) is a French [[mathematician]], currently Professor at the [[Collège de France]], [[IHÉS]], [[The Ohio State University]] and [[Vanderbilt University]].

==Work==
Alain Connes studies [[operator algebra]]s. In his early work on [[von Neumann algebras]] in the 1970s, he succeeded in obtaining the almost complete classification of injective [[Von Neumann algebra#Factors|factor]]s. Following this he made contributions in [[K-theory|operator K-theory]] and [[index theory]], which culminated in the 
[[Baum-Connes conjecture]]. He also introduced [[cyclic homology|cyclic cohomology]] in the early 1980s as a first step in the study of [[noncommutative geometry|noncommutative differential geometry]].

Connes has applied his work in areas of [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical physics]], including [[number theory]], [[differential geometry]] and [[particle physics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-geometer-of-particle Scientific Americain, ''The Geometer of Particle Physics'', July 24, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honours==

Connes was awarded the [[Fields Medal]] in 1982, the [[Crafoord Prize]] in 2001 and the gold medal of the [[CNRS]] in 2004.  He is a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] and several foreign academies and societies, including the [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters|Danish Academy of Sciences]], [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters|Norwegian Academy of Sciences]], [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], and [[United States National Academy of Sciences|US National Academy of Sciences]].

'''Allan Dwan''' (3 April 1885 – 28 December 1981) was a pioneering Canadian-born American motion picture director, producer and screenwriter.

==Early life==
Born '''Joseph Aloysius Dwan''' in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada, Dwan moved with his family to the United States when he was 11&amp;nbsp;years old. At the University of Notre Dame, he trained as an engineer and began working for a lighting company in Chicago. However, he had a strong interest in the fledgling motion picture industry and when [[Essanay Studios]] offered him the opportunity to become a scriptwriter, he took the job. At that time, some of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] movie makers began to spend winters in California where the climate allowed them to continue productions requiring warm weather. Soon, a number of movie companies worked there year-round and, in 1911, Dwan began working part-time in Hollywood. While still in New York, in 1917 he was the founding president of the East Coast chapter of the [[Motion Picture Directors Association]].

==Career==
Dwan operated [[Flying A Studios]] in [[La Mesa, California]] from August 1911 to July 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eastcountymagazine.org/node/6833|title= La mesa to honor its tinseltown roots aug. 12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lamesa.patch.com/articles/100-simple-melodramas-were-made-in-la-mesa-100-years-ago|title= Proto-Hollywood: 100 Melodramas Were Made In La Mesa 100 Years Ago}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Flying A was one of the first motion pictures studios in California history.  On 12 August 2011, a plaque was unveiled on the Wolff building at Third Ave and La Mesa Bl commemorating Dwan and the [[Flying A Studios]] origins in [[La Mesa, California]].

After making a series of westerns and comedies, Dwan directed fellow Canadian [[Mary Pickford]] in several very successful movies as well as her husband, [[Douglas Fairbanks]], notably in the acclaimed 1922 ''[[Robin Hood (1922 film)|Robin Hood]]''.

Following the introduction of the [[sound film|talkies]], in 1937 he directed child-star [[Shirley Temple]] in ''[[Heidi]]'' and ''[[Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938 film)|Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm]]'' the following year.

Dwan also helped launch the career of two other very successful Hollywood directors, [[Victor Fleming]], who went on to direct [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]] and [[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]], and [[Marshall Neilan]], who became an actor, director, writer and producer.

Over his long and successful career spanning over 50&amp;nbsp;years, he directed over 400&amp;nbsp;motion pictures, many of them highly acclaimed, such as the 1949 box office smash, ''[[Sands of Iwo Jima]]''. He directed his last movie in 1961.

He died in Los Angeles at the age of ninety-six, and is interred in the [[San Fernando Mission Cemetery]], [[Mission Hills, California]].

Allan Dwan has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6263 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].

[[File:Tassili ladies.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail of [[Tassili]] rock paintings dating from about 3000 BC relating a probably lost civilization in what was known as the [[Green Sahara]]]]
At Ain Hanech region ([[Saïda Province]]), early remnants (200,000 BC) of hominid occupation in North Africa were found. Neanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the [[Levallois technique|Levalloisian]] and [[Mousterian]] styles (43,000 BC) similar to those in the [[Levant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gi.ulpgc.es/tarha/Ain_Hanech.pdf |title=The Site of Ain Hanech Revisited: New Investigations at this Lower Pleistocene Site in Northern Algeria |publisher=Journal of Archaeological Science |author=Sahnouni, Mohamed and de Heinzelin, Jean |accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoneageinstitute.org/ain-hanech.html |title=Research at Ain Hanech, Algeria |publisher=Stoneageinstitute.org |date= |accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algeria was the site of the highest state of development of [[Middle Paleolithic]] [[Flake tool]] techniques. Tools of this era, starting about 30,000 BC, are called [[Aterian]] (after the archeological site of [[Bir el Ater]], south of [[Tebessa]]).

The earliest blade industries in North Africa are called [[Iberomaurusian]] (located mainly in [[Oran]] region). This industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal regions of the [[Maghreb]] between 15,000 and 10,000 BC. Neolithic civilization (animal domestication and agriculture) developed in the Saharan and Mediterranean Maghrib between 6000 and 2000 BC. This life, richly depicted in the [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] paintings, predominated in Algeria until the classical period.

The amalgam of peoples of North Africa coalesced eventually into a distinct native population that came to be called [[Berber people|Berbers]], who are the indigenous peoples of northern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Berbers|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|year=1997|chapter=Berbers in Antiquity|isbn=978-0-631-20767-2|url=http://books.google.com/?id=8Zcz91t29ukC|author=Brett, Michael; Fentress, Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From their principal center of power at Carthage, the [[Carthaginians]] expanded and established small settlements along the North African coast; by 600 BC, a [[Phoenicia]]n presence existed at [[Tipasa]], east of [[Cherchell]], [[Hippo Regius]] (modern [[Annaba]]) and [[Rusicade]] (modern [[Skikda]]). These settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages.

As Carthaginian power grew, its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically. Berber civilization was already at a stage in which agriculture, manufacturing, trade, and political organization supported several states. Trade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew, but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others.

[[File:Egypt, Rome, Carthage and Numidia.jpg|thumbnail|right|Numidia along with Egypt, Rome, and Carthage 200 BCE]]

By the early 4th century BC, Berbers formed the single largest element of the Carthaginian army. In the [[Mercenary War|Revolt of the Mercenaries]], Berber soldiers rebelled from 241 to 238 BC after being unpaid following the defeat of Carthage in the [[First Punic War]]. They succeeded in obtaining control of much of Carthage's North African territory, and they minted coins bearing the name Libyan, used in Greek to describe natives of North Africa. The Carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the Romans in the [[Punic Wars]].

In 146 BC the city of [[Carthage]] was destroyed. As Carthaginian power waned, the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew. By the 2nd century BC, several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged. Two of them were established in [[Numidia]], behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage. West of Numidia lay [[Mauretania]], which extended across the [[Moulouya River]] in modern day [[Morocco]] to the Atlantic Ocean. The high point of Berber civilization, unequaled until the coming of the [[Almohads]] and [[Almoravids]] more than a millennium later, was reached during the reign of [[Massinissa]] in the 2nd century BC.

After Masinissa's death in 148 BC, the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times. Massinissa's line survived until 24 AD, when the remaining Berber territory was annexed to the [[Roman Empire]].

For several centuries Algeria was ruled by the Romans, who founded many colonies in the region. Like the rest of North Africa, Algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire, exporting cereals and other agricultural products. The Vandals of [[Geiseric]] moved into North Africa in 429, and by 435 controlled coastal Numidia.&lt;ref name=&quot;vandaf&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cameron|first1=Averil|last2=Ward-Perkins|first2=Bryan|title=The Cambridge Ancient History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Qf8mrHjfZRoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA124|volume=14|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-32591-2|pages=124–126|chapter=Vandal Africa, 429–533}}&lt;/ref&gt; They did not make any significant settlement on the land.&lt;ref name=&quot;vandaf&quot;/&gt; The region was later recaptured by the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], which ruled it until the [[Muslim Conquest]] in the 7th century.

Muslim [[Arabs]] conquered Algeria in the mid-7th century and a large number of locals converted to the new faith. After the fall of the [[Umayyad]] [[Arab]] Dynasty in 751, numerous local Berber dynasties emerged, including the [[Aghlabids]], [[Almohads]], [[Abdalwadid]], [[Zirids]], [[Rustamids]], [[Hammadids]], [[Almoravids]] and the [[Fatimids]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Having converted the Berber [[Kutama]] of the [[Petite Kabylie]] to its cause, the [[Shia]] [[Fatimid]]s overthrew the [[Rustamid]]s and conquered Egypt, leaving Algeria and Tunisia to their [[Zirid dynasty|Zirid vassals]]. When the latter rebelled, the Fatimids sent in the [[Banu Hilal]] and [[Banu Sulaym]] Arabian tribes who unexpectedly defeated the [[Zirid]]s.&lt;ref name=Theotokis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Theotokis|first=Georgios|title=The Norman Invasion of Sicily, 1061–1072: Numbers and Military Tactics|journal=War in History|date=November 2010|volume=17|issue=4|pages=381–402}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tunisia&gt;{{cite journal|last=Curtiss|first=Richard R.|title=Tunisia: &quot;A Country That Works&quot;; Tunisia in History; The Country Which Gave Its Name to a Continent|journal=The Washington Report on Middle East Affairs|date=December 1996|volume=15|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Middle Ages the [[Fatimids]] or the sons of Fatima bent Muhammad as they were descended from Fatima, the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad, according to Fatimid claims&lt;ref&gt;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatimids&lt;/ref&gt; came to the Maghreb. These &quot;Fatimids&quot; went on to found a long lasting dynasty stretching across the Maghreb, Hejaz, and the Levant, boasting a secular inner government, and a powerful military and navy, primarily made up of the native North Africans or the Imazighen. The Imazighen or &quot;berbers&quot; controlled varying parts of the Maghreb, at times even unifying it (as under the Fatimids) as well as overseas conquests of Portugal, Senegal, Spain, Sicily, Egypt, Sudan, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Iraq, and Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/202580/Fatimid-Dynasty/2238/Conquest-of-Egypt|title=Fatimid Dynasty (Islamic dynasty)|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_carte.php?carte=carte-05 |title=Qantara |publisher=Qantara-med.org |date= |accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=595 |title=Qantara - Les Almoravides (1056-1147) |publisher=Qantara-med.org |date= |accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Caliphates from Northern Africa traded tit for tat with the other empires of their time, as well forming part of a confederated support and trade network with other Islamic states during the highly competitive Islamic Era.

The &quot;Berbers&quot; or Imazighen consisted of several tribes. The two main branches were the Botr and Barnès tribes, who were divided into tribes, and again into sub-tribes. Each region of the Maghreb contained several tribes (for example, [[Sanhadja]], Houaras, [[Zenata]], [[Masmuda|Masmouda]], Kutama, Awarba, and [[Berghwata]]). All these tribes were independent and made territorial decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=H3RBAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR2|title=Histoire des Berbères et des dynasties musulmanes de l'Afrique Septentrionale Par Ibn Khaldūn, William MacGuckin Slane| trans_title =History of the Berbers and the Muslim dynasties of northern Africa | language= French |page=XV|author=Khaldūn, Ibn|year=1852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Berber dynasties emerged during the Middle Ages in the Maghreb and other nearby lands. [[Ibn Khaldun]] provides a table summarizing the Berber dynasties of the Maghreb region, the Zirid, [[Banu Ifran]], [[Maghrawa]], [[Almoravid]], [[Hammadid]], [[Almohad]], [[Merinid]], Abdalwadid, [[Wattasid]], [[Meknassa]] and [[Hafsid]] dynasties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=H3RBAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR115|title=Histoire des Berbères et des dynasties musulmanes de l'Afrique Septentrionale Par Ibn Khaldūn, William MacGuckin Slane |trans_title =History of the Berbers and the Muslim dynasties of northern Africa | language= French |pages=X |author=Khaldūn, Ibn|year=1852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 16th century, Spain constructed fortified outposts ([[presidio]]s) on or near the Algerian coast. Spain took control of [[Mers el Kebir]] in 1505; [[Oran]] in 1509; and [[Tlemcen]], [[Mostaganem]], and [[Ténès]], in 1510. In the same year, the merchants of Algiers ceded one of the rocky islets in their harbor to Spain, which built a fort on it. The presidios in North Africa turned out to be a costly and largely ineffective military endeavor that did not guarantee access for Spain's merchant fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Offensive|url=http://countrystudies.us/algeria/14.htm|publisher=Country Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman Algeria===

[[File:Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hayreddin Barbarossa]]]]
[[File:Old algiers 16th century.jpg|thumb|Old [[Algiers]] in the 16th century, with the Spanish-built [[Peñón of Algiers]] in the forefront]]
In 1516 the Muslim privateer brothers [[Aruj]] and [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]], who operated successfully under the [[Hafsids]], moved their base of operations to Algiers. When Aruj was killed in 1518 during his invasion of [[Kingdom of Tlemcen|Tlemcen]], Hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of Algiers. The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sultan gave him the title of [[beylerbey]] and a contingent of some 2,000 [[janissaries]]. With the aid of this force, Hayreddin subdued the coastal region between Constantine and Oran (although the city of Oran remained in Spanish hands until 1791).&lt;ref name=&quot;csa16&quot; /&gt;

The next beylerbey was Hayreddin's son [[Hasan Pasha (son of Barbarossa)|Hasan]], who assumed the position in 1544. Until 1587 the area was governed by officers who served terms with no fixed limits. Subsequently, with the institution of a regular Ottoman administration, governors with the title of pasha ruled for three-year terms. The pasha was assisted by janissaries, known in Algeria as the ojaq and led by an [[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|agha]]. Discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid-1600s because they were not paid regularly, and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha. As a result, the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in 1659.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa16&quot; /&gt;

[[Plague (disease)|Plague]] had repeatedly struck the cities of North Africa. Algiers lost from 30,000 to 50,000 inhabitants to the plague in 1620–21, and suffered high fatalities in 1654–57, 1665, 1691, and 1740–42.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis&quot; /&gt;

In 1671, the [[taifa]] rebelled, killed the agha, and placed one of its own in power. The new leader received the title of [[dey]]. After 1689, the right to select the dey passed to the [[divan]], a council of some sixty notables. It was at first dominated by the ''[[ojaq]]''; but by the 18th century, it had become the dey's instrument. In 1710, the dey persuaded the sultan to recognize him and his successors as regent, replacing the [[pasha]] in that role. Although Algiers remained a part of the Ottoman Empire, the Ottoman government ceased to have effective influence there.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa16&quot; /&gt;

The dey was in effect a constitutional autocrat. The dey was elected for a life term, but in the 159 years (1671–1830) that the system survived, fourteen of the twenty-nine deys were assassinated. Despite usurpation, military coups, and occasional mob rule, the day-to-day operation of government was remarkably orderly. Although the regency patronized the tribal chieftains, it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside, where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest. Autonomous tribal states were tolerated, and the regency's authority was seldom applied in the [[Kabylie]].&lt;ref name=&quot;csa16&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Algeria&amp;nbsp;– Ottoman Rule|url=http://countrystudies.us/algeria/16.htm|publisher=Country Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following those wars, Algeria was weaker, and Europeans, with an Anglo-Dutch fleet commanded by the British [[Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth|Lord Exmouth]], [[Bombardment of Algiers (1816)|attacked Algiers]]. After a nine-hour bombardment, they obtained a treaty from the Dey that reaffirmed the conditions imposed by [[Stephen Decatur|Decatur]] (US navy) concerning the demands of tributes. In addition, the Dey agreed to end the practice of enslaving Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Littell, Eliakim  |title=The Museum of foreign literature, science and art |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=48L1w21XYI4C&amp;pg=PA231 |year=1836 |publisher=E.

From 1848 until independence, France administered the whole Mediterranean region of Algeria as an integral part and département of the nation. One of France's longest-held overseas territories, Algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of [[European ethnic groups|European]] immigrants, who became known as ''colons'' and later, as ''[[Pied-Noir]]s.'' Between 1825 and 1847, 50,000 French people emigrated to Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Randell|first=Keith|title=France: Monarchy, Republic and Empire, 1814–70|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AvyGHAAACAAJ|year=1986|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton|isbn=978-0-340-51805-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2013}} These settlers benefited from the French government's confiscation of communal land from tribal peoples, and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Horne, Alistair |title=A Savage War of Peace: Algeria 1954–1962 (New York Review Books Classics) |publisher=NYRB Classics |location=1755 Broadway, New York, NY 10019 |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-59017-218-6 |oclc=|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gradually, dissatisfaction among the Muslim population, which lacked political and economic status in the colonial system, gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy, and eventually independence, from France. Tensions between the two population groups came to a head in 1954, when the first violent events of what was later called the [[Algerian War]] began. Historians have estimated that between 30,000 and 150,000 [[Harkis]] and their dependents were killed by the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|Front de Libération Nationale]] (FLN) or by [[lynching|lynch]] mobs in Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7130307.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=French 'Reparation' for Algerians | date=6 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FLN used terrorist attacks in Algeria and France as part of its war, and the French conducted severe reprisals and repression. The war concluded in 1962, when Algeria gained complete independence following the March 1962 [[Evian agreements]] and the July 1962 [[Algerian self-determination referendum, 1962|self-determination referendum]].

===Independence===
{{main|History of Algeria (1962–99)}}
[[File:Houari Boumediene's Portrait.jpg|150px|thumbnail|left|[[Houari Boumediene]]]]
Algeria's first president was the FLN leader [[Ahmed Ben Bella]]. Morocco's claim to [[Greater Morocco|portions of western Algeria]] led to the [[Sand War]] in 1963. Ben Bella was overthrown in 1965 by [[Houari Boumediene]], his former ally and defense minister. Under Ben Bella, the government had become increasingly socialist and [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]]; Boumédienne continued this trend. But, he relied much more on the army for his support, and reduced the sole legal party to a symbolic role. He [[collective farming|collectivised]] agriculture and launched a massive industrialization drive. [[Extraction of petroleum|Oil extraction]] facilities were nationalized. This was especially beneficial to the leadership after the international [[1973 oil crisis]].

In the 1960s and 1970s under President Houari Boumediene, Algeria pursued a programme of industrialisation within a state-controlled socialist economy. Boumediene's successor, [[Chadli Bendjedid]], introduced some liberal economic reforms. He promoted a policy of [[Arabisation]] in Algerian society and public life. Teachers of Arabic, brought in from other Muslim countries, spread radical Islamic thought in schools and sowed the seeds of political Islamism.&lt;ref name=&quot;faco&quot; /&gt;

The Algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil, leading to hardship when the price collapsed during the [[1980s oil glut]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Prochaska|first=David|title=That Was Then, This Is Now: The Battle of Algiers and After.|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/rhr/summary/v085/85.1prochaska.html|page=141|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic recession caused by the crash in world oil prices resulted in Algerian social unrest during the 1980s; by the end of the decade, Bendjedid introduced a multi-party system. Political parties developed, such as the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] (FIS), a broad coalition of Islamist groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;faco&quot; /&gt;

===Civil War and aftermath===
{{main|Algerian Civil War}}

In December 1991 the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] dominated the first of two rounds of [[Algerian legislative election, 1991|legislative elections]]. Fearing the election of an Islamist government, the authorities intervened on 11 January 1992, cancelling the elections. Bendjedid resigned and a [[High Council of State (Algeria)|High Council of State]] was installed to act as Presidency. It banned the FIS, triggering a civil [[insurgency]] between the Front's armed wing, the [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], and the national armed forces, in which more than 100,000 persons are thought to have died. The Islamist militants conducted a violent campaign of [[List of massacres during the Algerian Civil War|civilian massacres]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/30/world/98-die-in-one-of-algerian-civil-war-s-worst-massacres.html 98 Die in One of Algerian Civil War's Worst Massacres ]&quot;. ''The New York Times''. 30 August 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; At several points in the conflict, the situation in Algeria became a point of international concern, most notably during the crisis surrounding [[Air France Flight 8969]], a hijacking perpetrated by the Armed Islamic Group. The Armed Islamic Group declared a ceasefire in October 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;faco&quot; /&gt;

Algeria held [[Algerian presidential election, 1999|elections in 1999]], considered biased by international observers and most opposition groups &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2013/algeria#.Ut_5Aig4m2w |title = Freedom in the World 2013: Algeria|publisher = Freedom House| author = &quot;Freedom House&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were won by President [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]]. He worked to restore political stability to the country and announced a 'Civil Concord' initiative, approved in a [[Algerian Civil Concord referendum, 1999|referendum]], under which many political prisoners were pardoned, and several thousand members of armed groups were granted exemption from prosecution under a limited amnesty, in force until 13 January 2000. The AIS disbanded and levels of insurgent violence fell rapidly. The [[Groupe Salafiste pour la Prédication et le Combat]] (GSPC), a splinter group of the Group Islamic Armée, continued a terrorist campaign against the Government.&lt;ref name=&quot;faco&quot; /&gt;

[[File:A Market in Algeria.jpg|thumb|Algeria is more stable than other North African countries]]
Bouteflika was re-elected in the [[Algerian presidential election, 2004|April 2004 presidential election]] after campaigning on a programme of national reconciliation. The programme comprised economic, institutional, political and social reform to modernise the country, raise living standards, and tackle the causes of alienation. It also included a second amnesty initiative, the [[Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation]], which was approved in a [[Algerian national reconciliation referendum, 2005|referendum in September 2005]]. It offered amnesty to most guerrillas and Government security forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;faco&quot; /&gt;

In November 2008, the [[Algerian Constitution]] was amended following a vote in Parliament, removing the two-term limit on Presidential incumbents. This change enabled Bouteflika to stand for re-election in the [[Algerian presidential election, 2009|2009 presidential elections]], and he was re-elected in April 2009. During his election campaign and following his re-election, Bouteflika promised to extend the programme of national reconciliation and a $150-billion spending programme to create three million new jobs, the construction of one million new housing units, and to continue public sector and infrastructure modernisation programmes.&lt;ref name=&quot;faco&quot; /&gt;

A continuing series of protests throughout the country started on 28 December 2010, inspired by similar [[Arab Spring|protests across the Middle East and North Africa]]. On 24 February 2011, the government lifted Algeria's 19-year-old [[state of emergency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://articles.cnn.com/2011-02-24/world/algeria.emergency_1_islamist-party-algerian-press-service-emergency-declaration?_s=PM:WORLD | title = Algeria Officially Lifts State of Emergency |publisher=CNN |date=24 February 2011|accessdate=27 February 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110301134330/http://articles.cnn.com/2011-02-24/world/algeria.emergency_1_islamist-party-algerian-press-service-emergency-declaration?_s=PM:WORLD| archivedate= 1 March 2011 &lt;!-- DASHBot --&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government enacted legislation dealing with political parties, the electoral code, and the representation of women in elected bodies.&lt;ref name=&quot;aaeo&quot; /&gt; In April 2011, Bouteflika promised further constitutional and political reform.&lt;ref name=&quot;faco&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Country Profile: Algeria|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20101213054455/http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/country-profile/middle-east-north-africa/algeria/?profile=all|publisher=Foreign and Commonwealth Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, elections are routinely criticized by opposition groups as unfair and international human rights groups say that media censorship and harassment of political opponents continue.

Algeria is the largest country in Africa, the [[Arab world]], and the [[Mediterranean Basin]]. Its southern part includes a significant portion of the [[Sahara]]. To the north, the [[Tell Atlas]] form with the [[Saharan Atlas]], further south, two parallel sets of reliefs in approaching eastbound, and between which are inserted vast plains and highlands. Both Atlas tend to merge in eastern Algeria. The vast mountain ranges of [[Aures]] and [[Tebessa|Nememcha]] occupy the entire northeastern Algeria and are delineated by the Tunisian border. The highest point is [[Mount Tahat]] ({{formatnum: 3003}} m).
[[File:Algeria relief.png|thumb|The [[Sahara]], the [[Ahaggar Mountains|Ahaggar]] and the [[Atlas Mountains|Atlas]] mountains compose the Algerian relief]]
Algeria lies mostly between latitudes [[19th parallel north|19°]] and [[37th parallel north|37°N]] (a small area is north of 37°), and longitudes [[9th meridian west|9°W]] and [[12th meridian east|12°E]]. Most of the coastal area is hilly, sometimes even mountainous, and there are a few natural [[harbour]]s. The area from the coast to the Tell Atlas is fertile. South of the Tell Atlas is a [[steppe]] landscape ending with the [[Saharan Atlas]]; farther south, there is the Sahara desert.&lt;ref name=LOC&gt;{{cite web|last=Metz|first=Helen Chapin|title=Algeria : a country study|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/dztoc.html|publisher=United States Library of Congress|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ahaggar Mountains]] ({{lang-ar|جبال هقار}}), also known as the Hoggar, are a highland region in central Sahara, southern Algeria. They are located about {{convert|1500|km|0|abbr=on}} south of the capital, Algiers, and just west of [[Tamanghasset]]. Algiers, [[Oran]], [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]], and [[Annaba]] are Algeria's main cities.&lt;ref name=LOC /&gt;

===Climate and hydrology===
{{Main|Climate of Algeria}}
[[File:Hoggar8.jpg|thumb|An oasis in the [[Hoggar]]]]
[[File:Agoulmime.jpg|thumb|left|Lake Agoulmime, [[Tikjda]].]]

In this region, midday desert temperatures can be hot year round. After sunset, however, the clear, dry air permits rapid loss of heat, and the nights are cool to chilly. Enormous daily ranges in temperature are recorded.

The highest official temperature was {{convert|50.6|°C|°F}} at In Salah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Extreme Weather&amp;nbsp;– A Guide and Record Book|url=http://www.mherrera.org/temp.htm|publisher=W.W. Norton Press|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5mgEKD3NJ|archivedate=10 January 2010|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rainfall is fairly plentiful along the coastal part of the Tell Atlas, ranging from {{convert|400|to|670|mm|1|abbr=on}} annually, the amount of precipitation increasing from west to east. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is heaviest in the northern part of eastern Algeria, where it reaches as much as {{convert|1000|mm|1|abbr=on}} in some years.

Farther inland, the rainfall is less plentiful. Algeria also has [[erg (landform)|ergs]], or sand dunes, between mountains. Among these, in the summer time when winds are heavy and gusty, temperatures can get up to {{convert|110|°F|°C|1|abbr=on}}.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===Fauna and flora===
{{Main|Wildlife of Algeria}}
[[File:Cèdre du Chélia 13 (Algeria).jpg|thumb|left|[[Cedrus]] of Chélia in the [[Aures]]]]
The varied vegetation of Algeria includes [[coastal]], [[mountainous]] and grassy [[desert]]-like regions which all support a wide range of wildlife. Many of the creatures comprising the Algerian wildlife live in close proximity to civilization. The most commonly seen animals include the wild [[boar]]s, [[jackal]]s, and [[gazelle]]s, although it is not uncommon to spot [[fennecs]] (foxes), and [[jerboas]]. Algeria also has a few, [[leopard]] and [[cheetah]] populations, but these are seldom seen.

A variety of bird species makes the country an attraction for bird watchers. The forests are inhabited by boars and jackals. [[Barbary macaque]]s are the sole native monkey. Snakes, [[monitor lizard]]s, and numerous other reptiles can be found living among an array of [[rodent]]s throughout the [[semi arid]] regions of Algeria. Many animals are now extinct, among which the [[Barbary lion]]s and bears.

In the north, some of the native flora includes [[Macchia]] scrub, [[olive trees]], [[oak]]s, [[cedrus|cedar]]s and other [[conifers]]. The mountain regions contain large forests of evergreens ([[Aleppo pine]], [[juniper]], and [[evergreen oak]]) and some deciduous trees. [[Ficus|Fig]], [[eucalyptus]], [[agave]], and various [[palm trees]] grow in the warmer areas. The [[grape vine]] is indigenous to the coast. In the Sahara region, some oases have palm trees. [[Acacias]] with wild [[olives]] are the predominant flora in the remainder of the [[Sahara]].

[[Camel]]s are used extensively; the desert also abounds with poisonous and nonpoisonous snakes, [[scorpion]]s, and numerous insects.

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Algeria}}
[[File:Hémicycle de l'assemblée populaire nationale (Algérie).jpg|thumb|The [[People's National Assembly]]]]
Algeria is an [[authoritarian regime]], according to the [[Democracy Index]] 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Democracy Index 2010 | url=http://graphics.eiu.com/PDF/Democracy_Index_2010_web.pdf|work=eiu.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Freedom of the Press (report)|Freedom of the Press 2009]] report gives it rating &quot;Not Free&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Freedom of the Press 2009 | url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/uploads/fop/2009/FreedomofthePress2009_tables.pdf | publisher=[[Freedom House]] | accessdate=7 May 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090520232850/http://www.freedomhouse.org/uploads/fop/2009/FreedomofthePress2009_tables.pdf| archivedate= 20 May 2009 &lt;!-- DASHBot --&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elected politicians are considered to have relatively little sway over Algeria. Instead, a group of unelected civilian and military &quot;décideurs&quot;, known as &quot;le pouvoir&quot; (&quot;the power&quot;), actually rule the country, even deciding who should be president. The most powerful man may be [[Mohamed Mediène]], head of the military intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Still waiting for real democracy|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21554565|publisher=The Economist|date=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, many of these generals have died or retired. After the death of General [[Larbi Belkheir]], Bouteflika put loyalists in key posts, notably at [[Sonatrach]], and secured constitutional amendments that make him re-electable indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The president and the police|url=http://www.economist.com/node/15612455|publisher=The Economist|date=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The head of state is the president of Algeria, who is elected for a five-year term. The president was formerly limited to two five-year terms, but a constitutional amendment passed by the Parliament on 11 November 2008 removed this limitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7724635.stm |title= Algeria Deputies Scrap Term Limit |publisher=BBC News |date=12 November 2008 |accessdate=24 November 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081114015503/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7724635.stm| archivedate= 14 November 2008 &lt;!-- DASHBot --&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algeria has universal [[suffrage]] at 18 years of age.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlgeriaFactbook&quot;/&gt; The President is the head of the [[Algerian Army|army]], the [[Council of Ministers of Algeria|Council of Ministers]] and the [[High Security Council]].

The Algerian parliament is [[bicameral]]; the lower house, the [[People's National Assembly]], has 462 members who are directly elected for five-year terms, while the upper house, the [[Council of the Nation]], has 144 members serving six-year terms, of which 96 members are chosen by local assemblies and 48 are appointed by the president.&lt;ref name=fitw13 /&gt; According to the [[Constitution of Algeria|constitution]], no political association may be formed if it is &quot;based on differences in religion, language, race, gender, profession or region&quot;.

Parliamentary elections were last held in [[Algerian legislative election, 2012|May 2012]], and were judged to be largely free by international monitors, though local groups alleged fraud and irregularities.&lt;ref name=fitw13&gt;{{cite web|title=Algeria|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2013/algeria|work=Freedom in the World 2013|publisher=Freedom House|accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the elections, the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] won 221 seats, the military-backed [[National Rally for Democracy (Algeria)|National Rally for Democracy]] won 70, and the Islamist [[Green Algeria Alliance]] won 47.&lt;ref name=fitw13/&gt;

Tensions between Algeria and Morocco in relation to the [[Western Sahara]] have been an obstacle to tightening the [[Arab Maghreb Union]], nominally established in 1989, but which has carried little practical weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/990219/1999021906.html |publisher=ArabicNews.com |title=Bin Ali calls for reactivating Arab Maghreb Union, Tunisia-Maghreb, Politics |date=19 February 1999 |accessdate=4 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algeria is included in the European Union's [[European Neighbourhood Policy]] (ENP) which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer. 
Giving incentives and rewarding best performers, as well as offering funds in a faster and more flexible manner, are the two main principles underlying the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI), coming into force in 2014. It has a budget of €15.4 billion and will provide the bulk of funding through a number of programmes.

==Provinces and districts==
{{Main|Provinces of Algeria|Districts of Algeria|Municipalities of Algeria}}
Algeria is divided into 48 [[provinces of Algeria|provinces]] (''[[wilaya]]s''), 553 [[districts of Algeria|districts]] (''[[daïra]]s'') and 1,541 [[Municipalities of Algeria|municipalities]] (''[[baladiyah]]s''). Each province, district, and municipality is named after its [[Capital (political)|seat]], which is usually the largest city.

The administrative divisions have changed several times since independence. When introducing new provinces, the numbers of old provinces are kept, hence the non-alphabetical order. With their official numbers, currently (since 1983) they are&lt;ref name=&quot;AlgeriaFactbook&quot;/&gt;

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Algeria}}
[[File:Algeria Export Treemap.jpg|thumb|250px|Graphical depiction of the country's exports in 28 colour-coded categories.]]
Algeria is classified as an upper middle income country by the [[World Bank Group|World Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DATASTATISTICS/Resources/CLASS.XLS |title=World Bank list of economies |date= January 2011 |publisher=World Bank |accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economy remains dominated by the state, a legacy of the country's socialist post-independence development model. In recent years, the Algerian government has halted the privatization of state-owned industries and imposed restrictions on imports and foreign involvement in its economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlgeriaFactbook&quot;/&gt;

Algeria has struggled to develop industries outside of hydrocarbons in part because of high costs and an inert state bureaucracy. The government's efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector have done little to reduce high youth unemployment rates or to address housing shortages.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlgeriaFactbook&quot;/&gt; The country is facing a number of short-term and medium-term problems, including the need to diversify the economy, strengthen political, economic and financial reforms, improve the business climate and reduce inequalities amongst regions.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt;

A wave of economic protests in February and March 2011 prompted the Algerian government to offer more than $23 billion in public grants and retroactive salary and benefit increases. Public spending has increased by 27% annually during the past 5 years. The 2010–14 public-investment programme will cost US$286 billion, 40% of which will go to human development.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt;

The Algerian economy grew by 2.6% in 2011, driven by public spending, in particular in the construction and public-works sector, and by growing internal demand. If hydrocarbons are excluded, growth has been estimated at 4.8%. Growth of 3% is expected in 2012, rising to 4.2% in 2013. The rate of inflation was 4% and the budget deficit 3% of GDP. The current-account surplus is estimated at 9.3% of GDP and at the end of December 2011, official reserves were put at US$182 billion.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt; Inflation, the lowest in the region, has remained stable at 4% on average between 2003 and 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;MFW4A&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfw4a.org/algeria/algeria-financial-sector-profile.html |title=Algeria: Financial Sector Profile |publisher=Making Finance Work for Africa |date= |accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Algeria, Trends in the Human Development Index 1970-2010.png|thumb|250px|Algeria, trends in the [[Human Development Index]] 1970-2010]]
In 2011 Algeria announced a budgetary surplus of $26.9 billion, 62% increase in comparison to 2010 surplus. In general, the country exported $73 billion worth of commodities while it imported $46 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.nuqudy.com/General_Overview/North_Africa/Algeria_Non-Oil_Exp-676 |title=Algeria Non-Oil Exports Surge 41% |publisher=nuqudy.com |date=25 January 2012 |accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to strong hydrocarbon revenues, Algeria has a cushion of $173 billion in [[foreign currency reserves]] and a large hydrocarbon stabilization fund. In addition, Algeria's [[List of countries by external debt|external debt]] is extremely low at about 2% of GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlgeriaFactbook&quot;/&gt; The economy remains very dependent on hydrocarbon wealth, and, despite high foreign exchange reserves (US$178 billion, equivalent to three years of imports), current expenditure growth makes Algeria's budget more vulnerable to the risk of prolonged lower hydrocarbon revenues.&lt;ref name=imfart4/&gt;

In 2011, the agricultural sector and services recorded growth of 10% and 5.3%, respectively.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt; About 14% of the labor force are employed in the [[Agriculture in Algeria|agricultural sector]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AlgeriaFactbook&quot;/&gt; Fiscal policy in 2011 remained expansionist and made it possible to maintain the pace of public investment and to contain the strong demand for jobs and housing.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt;

Algeria has not joined the [[WTO]], despite several years of negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doing Business in Algeria|url=http://algiers.usembassy.gov/doing_business_algeria.html|publisher=Embassy of the United States Algiers, Algeria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrocarbons===
{{see also|Mining industry of Algeria}}
[[File:Ra ffin erie.jpg|thumb|Refinery located in Sidi Arcine ([[Baraki, Algiers]])]]
Algeria, whose economy is reliant on petroleum, has been an [[OPEC]] member since 1969. Its crude oil production stands at around 1.1 million barrels/day, but it is also a major gas producer and exporter, with important links to Europe.&lt;ref name=opb15&gt;{{cite web|title=OPEC Bulletin 8-9/12|url=http://www.opec.org/opec_web/flipbook/OB08092012/OB08092012/assets/basic-html/page17.html|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrocarbons have long been the backbone of the economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget revenues, 30% of GDP, and over 95% of export earnings. Algeria has the [[List of countries by natural gas proven reserves|10th-largest reserves of natural gas]] in the world and is the [[List of countries by natural gas exports|sixth-largest gas exporter]]. The U.S. [[Energy Information Administration]] reported that in 2005, Algeria had {{convert|160|Tcuft}} of proven [[natural gas reserves|natural-gas reserves]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ciawfb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2253rank.html|title=Country Comparison: Natural Gas – Proved Reserves|publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also ranks [[List of countries by proven oil reserves|16th in oil reserves]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AlgeriaFactbook&quot;/&gt;

Non-hydrocarbon growth for 2011 was projected at 5%. To cope with social demands, the authorities raised expenditure, especially on basic food support, employment creation, support for SMEs, and higher salaries. High hydrocarbon prices have improved the current account and the already large international reserves position.&lt;ref name=imfart4/&gt;

Income from oil and gas rose in 2011 as a result of continuing high oil prices, though the trend in production volume is downwards.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt; Production from the oil and gas sector in terms of volume, continues to decline, dropping from 43.2 million tonnes to 32 million tonnes between 2007 and 2011. Nevertheless, the sector accounted for 98% of the total volume of exports in 2011, against 48% in 1962,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsa-algerie.com/actualite/item/622-le-temps-des-crapules |title=Le temps des crapules&amp;nbsp;– Tout sur l'Algérie |publisher=Tsa-algerie.com |date= |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 70% of budgetary receipts, or USD 71.4 billion.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt;

The Algerian national oil company is [[Sonatrach]], which plays a key role in all aspects of the oil and natural gas sectors in Algeria. All foreign operators must work in partnership with Sonatrach, which usually has majority ownership in production-sharing agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Country Analysis Briefs&amp;nbsp;– Algeria|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20130531053812/http://www.eia.gov/cabs/Algeria/pdf.pdf|publisher=Energy Information Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labour market===
Despite a decline in total unemployment, youth and women unemployment is high.&lt;ref name=imfart4&gt;{{cite web|title=Algeria: 2011 Article IV Consultation|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2012/cr1220.pdf|publisher=IMF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unemployment particularly affects the young, with a jobless rate of 21.5% among the 15–24 age group.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt;

The overall rate of unemployment was 10% in 2011, but remained higher among young people, with a rate of 21.5% for those aged between 15 and 24. The government strengthened in 2011 the job programmes introduced in 1988, in particular in the framework of the programme to aid those seeking work (Dispositif d'Aide à l'Insertion Professionnelle).&lt;ref name=aaeo&gt;{{cite web|title=Algeria|url=http://www.africaneconomicoutlook.org/en/countries/north-africa/algeria/|publisher=African Economic Outlook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tourism===
{{Main|Tourism in Algeria}}
[[Image:Djanet-Algeria-night.jpg|thumb|[[Djanet]]]]
The development of the tourism sector in Algeria had previously been hampered by a lack of facilities, but since 2004 a broad tourism development strategy has been implemented resulting in many hotels of a high modern standard being built.

There are several [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]] in Algeria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNESCO|title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/dz|accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Al Qal'a of Beni Hammad]], the first capital of the [[Hammadid]] empire; [[Tipasa]], a Phoenician and later Roman town; and [[Djémila]] and [[Timgad]], both [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ruins; [[M'Zab Valley]], a limestone valley containing a large urbanized [[oasis]]; also the [[Casbah]] of Algiers is an important citadel. The only natural [[World Heritage Sites]] is the [[Tassili n'Ajjer]], a mountain range.

[[File:Autoroute est ouest ghomri2.JPG|thumb|The main highway relaying the Moroccan to the Tunisian borders, was a part of the [[Cairo–Dakar Highway]] project]]
The Algerian road network is the most dense of the African continent, its length is estimated at 180,000&amp;nbsp;km of highways, with a rate of more than 3 756 structures and paving of 85%. This network should be complemented by a major highway infrastructure being completed, the East-West Highway. It is a 3-way 1 216&amp;nbsp;km, linking the city of [[Annaba]] in the extreme east to the city of [[Tlemcen]] in the far West. Algeria is also crossed by the [[Trans-Sahara Highway]], which is now totally paved. This road is pushed forward by the Algerian government to increase trade between the six countries crossed (Algeria, [[Mali]], Niger, [[Nigeria]], Chad and [[Tunisia]]).

[[File:Hamid Tibouchi, 1997.jpg|thumb|[[:fr:Hamid Tibouchi|Hamid Tibouchi]], a painter and calligrapher]]

Algerian painters, like [[:fr:Mohamed Racim|Mohamed Racim]] or Baya, attempted to revive the prestigious Algerian past prior to French colonization, at the same time that they have contributed to the preservation of the authentic values of Algeria. In this line, [[Mohamed Temam]], [[Abdelkhader Houamel]] have also returned through this art, scenes from the history of the country, the habits and customs of the past and the country life. Other new artistic currents including the one of [[M'hamed Issiakhem]], [[Mohammed Khadda]] and [[Bachir Yelles]], appeared on the scene of Algerian painting, abandoning figurative classical painting to find new pictorial ways, in order to adapt Algerian paintings to the new realities of the country through its struggle and its aspirations. [[Mohammed Khadda]]&lt;ref name=art&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khadda.com/ |title=Mohammed Khadda |publisher=Khadda.com |date= |accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[M'hamed Issiakhem]] have been notable in recent years.&lt;ref name=art/&gt;

===Literature===
{{Main|Algerian literature|List of Algerian writers}}

The historic roots of Algerian literature goes back to the [[Numidia]]n era, when [[Apuleius]] wrote ''[[The Golden Ass]]'', the only Latin novel to survive in its entirety. This period had also known [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Nonius Marcellus]] and [[Martianus Capella]], among many others. The Middle Ages have known many Arabic writers who revolutionized the Arab world literature, with authors like [[Ahmad al-Buni]], [[Ibn Manzur]] and [[Ibn Khaldoun]], who wrote the [[Muqaddimah]] while staying in Algeria, and many others.

[[Albert Camus]] was an Algerian-born French Pied-Noir author. In 1957 he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in literature]].

{{double image|right|Lucius Apuleius Platonicus, from 'Crabbes Historical Dictionary', published in 1825 (C19).jpg|120|Kateb Yacine Nedjma authograph.jpg|120|[[Apuleius]]|[[Kateb Yacine]]}}

Today Algeria contains, in its literary landscape, big names having not only marked the Algerian literature, but also the universal literary heritage in Arabic and French.

As a first step, Algerian literature was marked by works whose main concern was the assertion of the Algerian national entity, there is the publication of novels as the ''Algerian trilogy'' of [[Mohammed Dib]], or even ''Nedjma'' of [[Kateb Yacine]] novel which is often regarded as a monumental and major work. Other known writers will contribute to the emergence of Algerian literature whom include [[Mouloud Feraoun]], [[Malek Bennabi]], [[Malek Haddad]], [[Moufdi Zakaria]], [[Ibn Badis]], Mohamed Laïd Al-Khalifa, [[Mouloud Mammeri]], [[Frantz Fanon]], and [[Assia Djebar]].

In the aftermath of the independence, several new authors emerged on the Algerian literary scene, they will attempt through their works to expose a number of social problems, among them there are [[Rachid Boudjedra]], [[Rachid Mimouni]], [[Leila Sebbar]], [[Tahar Djaout]] and [[Tahir Wattar]].

Currently, a part of Algerian writers tends to be defined in a literature of shocking expression, due to the terrorism that occurred during the 1990s, the other party is defined in a different style of literature who staged an individualistic conception of the human adventure. Among the most noted recent works, there is the writer, ''the swallows of Kabul'' and ''the attack'' of [[Yasmina Khadra]], ''the oath of barbarians'' of [[Boualem Sansal]], ''memory of the flesh'' of [[Ahlam Mosteghanemi]] and the last novel by Assia Djebar ''nowhere in my father's House''.

Access to &quot;improved water sources&quot; was limited to 92% of the population in urban areas and 80% of the population in rural areas. Some 99% of Algerians living in urban areas, but only 82% of those living in rural areas, had access to &quot;improved sanitation&quot;. According to the World Bank, Algeria is making progress toward its goal of &quot;reducing by half the number of people without sustainable access to improved drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015&quot;. Given Algeria's young population, policy favors preventive health care and clinics over hospitals. In keeping with this policy, the government maintains an immunization program. However, poor sanitation and unclean water still cause [[tuberculosis]], [[hepatitis]], [[measles]], [[typhoid fever]], [[cholera]] and [[dysentery]]. The poor generally receive health care free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Algeria.pdf |title=Library of Congress Country Studies – Algeria |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health records have been maintained in Algeria since 1882 and began adding Muslims living in the South to their Vital record database in 1905 during French rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kemp, Thomas Jay |title=International Vital Records Handbook|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=afnc6_o5AqoC&amp;pg=PA347|year=2009|publisher=Genealogical Publishing Com|isbn=978-0-8063-1793-9|page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Algeria|List of universities in Algeria}}
[[File:Med Alger.jpg|thumb|[[Algiers]] Medical School]]

Since the 1970s, in a centralized system that was designed to significantly reduce the rate of illiteracy, the Algerian government introduced a decree by which the school became compulsory for all children aged between 6 and 15 years who have the ability to track their learning through the 20 facilities built since independence, now the literacy rate is around 78.7%.&lt;ref name=&quot;illit&quot;/&gt;

Since 1972, Arabic is used as the language of instruction during the first nine years of schooling. From the third year, French is taught and it is also the language of instruction for science classes. The students can also learn English, Italian, Spanish and German. In 2008, new programs at the elementary appeared, therefore the compulsory schooling does not start at the age of six anymore, but at the age of five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presse-dz.com/revue-de-presse/version-imprimable/1045-les-verites-de-benbouzid.html |title=Ecoles privées, Tamazight, enseignement du Français, syndicats&amp;nbsp;... – Les vérités de Benbouzid |publisher=Presse-dz.com |date= |accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Apart from the 122 private, learning at school, the Universities of the State are free of charge. After nine years of primary school, students can go to the high school or to an educational institution. The school offers two programs: general or technical. At the end of the third year of secondary school, students pass the exam of the Bachelor's degree, which allows once it is successful to pursue graduate studies in universities and institutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.algerie-dz.com/article10808.html |title=Le taux d'analphabétisme en Algérie est de 21,3% |publisher=Algerie-dz.com |date= |accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education is officially compulsory for children between the ages of six and 15. In 2008, the illiteracy rate for people over 10 was 22.3%, 15.6% for men and 29.0% for women. The province with the lowest rate of illiteracy was [[Algiers Province]] at 11.6%, while the province with the highest rate was [[Djelfa Province]] at 35.5%.&lt;ref name=&quot;illit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Taux d'Analphabétisme et taux d'Alphabétisation de la population âgée de 10 ans et plus selon le sexe et la wilaya de résidence|url=http://www.ons.dz/IMG/pdf/pop9_national.pdf|publisher=Office National des Statistiques}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algeria has 26 universities and 67 institutions of higher education, which must accommodate a million Algerians and 80,000 foreign students in 2008. The University of Algiers, founded in 1879, is the oldest, it offers education in various disciplines (law, medicine, science and letters). 25 of these universities and almost all of the institutions of higher education were founded after the independence of the country.

Even if some of them offer instruction in [[Arabic]] like areas of law and the economy, most of the other sectors as science and medicine continue to be provided in French and English. Among the most important universities, there are the University of sciences and technology Houari Boumediene, the University of Mentouri Constantine, Oran Es-Senia University. Best universities of qualifications remain the University of Tlemcen and Batna Hadj Lakhdar, they occupy the 26th and 45th row in Africa, which is a very bad standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webometrics.info/en/Africa/Algeria |title=Algeria &amp;#124; Ranking Web of Universities |publisher=Webometrics.info |date= |accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Atlas Shrugged'' characters}}
This is a list of characters in [[Ayn Rand]]'s novel ''[[Atlas Shrugged]].''

==Major characters==
The following are major characters from the novel.&lt;ref&gt;Characters are listed as &quot;major&quot; if they meet one of the following criteria:
*they are listed as &quot;major&quot; characters in a widely available study guide, such as [[CliffsNotes]], [[SparkNotes]], or [[Gale (Cengage)|Gale's]] ''Novels for Students'';
*they are listed as &quot;primary heroic&quot; or &quot;arch-villain&quot; characters in Gladstein's ''The New Ayn Rand Companion'';
*they are the focus of an essay in a scholarly book about the novel, such as ''Essays on Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged'' or ''Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protagonists===

====Dagny Taggart====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Taylor-Schilling-as-Dagny-Taggart.jpg|thumb|upright=0.56|right|[[Taylor Schilling]] as Dagny Taggart in the 2011 film.]] --&gt;
Dagny Taggart is the [[protagonist]] of the novel. She is Vice-President in Charge of Operations for Taggart Transcontinental, under her brother, James Taggart. However, due to James' incompetence, it is Dagny who is responsible for all the workings of the railroad.

====Francisco d'Anconia====
Francisco d'Anconia is one of the central characters in ''Atlas Shrugged'', and owner by inheritance of the world's largest copper mining empire. He is a childhood friend, and the first love of Dagny Taggart.

A child prodigy of exceptional talents, Francisco was dubbed the &quot;climax&quot; of the d'Anconia line, an already prestigious family of skilled industrialists. He attended Patrick Henry University and was a classmate of John Galt and Ragnar Danneskjöld and student of both Hugh Akston and Robert Stadler. He began working at a young age, while still in school, proving that he could have made a successful career on his own merits without the aid of his family's wealth and power.

Francisco is one of the strikers and is slowly destroying the d'Anconia empire to put it out of the raiders' reach. His actions were designed both to &quot;trap&quot; looters into relying upon his worthless ventures in order to disrupt their schemes and to try to show the inevitable consequences of looting. He adopted the persona of a worthless playboy, by which he is known to the world, as an effective cover. However, he is forced to give up Dagny, knowing that she would not be ready to join the strikers. He remains deeply in love with her throughout the book, while also being a good and loyal friend of her other two lovers, Hank Rearden and John Galt.

His full name is given as Francisco Domingo Carlos Andres Sebastián d'Anconia.&lt;ref&gt;The accent in the given name ''Sebastián'' is in accordance with [[Spanish orthography]]; however, the same rule would require writing ''Andrés''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====John Galt====
{{Main|John Galt}}
The enigmatic John Galt is the primary male hero of ''Atlas Shrugged.'' He initially appears as an unnamed menial worker for Taggart Transcontinental, who often dines with Eddie Willers in the employee's cafeteria, and leads Eddie to reveal important information about Dagny Taggart and Taggart Transcontinental. Only Eddie's side of their conversations is given in the novel. Eddie tells him which suppliers and contractors Dagny is most dependent on; these men are consistently the next to disappear. Later in the novel, the reader discovers this worker's true identity.

Before working for Taggart Transcontinental, Galt worked as an engineer for the Twentieth Century Motor Company. While there, he invented his generator that produced usable electric energy from static electricity in the environment. His Prototype may or may not have been completed when he left due to the management deciding on a communistic pay system. This prototype was found by Dagny when she and Hank Rearden made a trip to the long-closed Twentieth Century Motor factory. Dagny would hire Quentin Daniels to try to figure out how the machine worked.

Galt would take over the radio airwaves during Mr. Thompson's much heralded speech at the end of the book and give his long soliloquy.

====Henry &quot;Hank&quot; Rearden====
Henry (also known as &quot;Hank&quot;) is one of the central characters in ''Atlas Shrugged''. Like many of Rand's capitalist characters, he is a self-made man. He owns the most important steel company in the United States. He invents Rearden Metal, an [[alloy]] stronger than steel (with similar properties to stainless steel). He lives in [[Philadelphia]] with his wife Lillian, his brother Philip, and his elderly mother, all of whom he supports.

Hank Rearden knows something is wrong with the world but he is unable to define the problem. His friend, Francisco d'Anconia, helps him understand and by this mechanism the reader is also prepared to understand the secret when it is revealed explicitly in Galt's Speech. Rearden also serves to illustrate Rand's [[Atlas Shrugged#Theory of sex|theory of sex]]. Lillian Rearden cannot appreciate Hank Rearden's virtues, and she is portrayed as being disgusted by sex. Dagny Taggart clearly does appreciate Rearden's virtues, and this appreciation evolves into sexual desire. Rearden is torn because he accepts the premises of the traditional view of sex as a lower instinct, but he responds sexually to Dagny, who represents his highest values. Rearden struggles to resolve this internal conflict, and in doing so, illustrates Rand's sexual theory.

====Eddie Willers====
Edwin &quot;Eddie&quot; Willers is the Special Assistant to the Vice-President in Charge of Operations at Taggart Transcontinental. He grew up with Dagny Taggart. His father and grandfather worked for the Taggarts, and he followed in their footsteps. He is completely loyal to Dagny and to Taggart Transcontinental. He is also secretly in love with Dagny. Willers is generally assumed to represent the common man: someone who does not possess the Promethean creative ability of The Strikers, but matches them in moral courage and is capable of appreciating and making use of their creations. After Dagny shifts her attention and loyalty to saving the captive Galt, he does everything he can to keep the railroad running as the country falls apart. When the train he is riding on breaks down, he tries in vain to repair it as the passengers and crew abandon him, then collapses sobbing on the tracks.

====Ragnar Danneskjöld====
One of the original strikers, he is now world famous as a [[pirate]]. Ragnar attended Patrick Henry University and became friends with John Galt and Francisco d'Anconia while studying under Hugh Akston and Robert Stadler. Danneskjöld seizes relief ships that are being sent from the United States to The People's States of Europe. As the novel progresses, Danneskjöld begins to become active in American waters. Danneskjöld's action is to restore to other creative people the money, in gold, which was unjustly taken away from them—specifically, their [[income tax]] payments. He explains this is not [[altruism]]; his motivation is to ensure that once those espousing Galt's philosophy are restored to their rightful place in society, they will have enough capital to rebuild the world.

Kept in the background for much of the book, Danneskjöld makes a personal appearance when he risks his life to meet Hank Rearden in the night and hand him a bar of gold as an &quot;advance payment&quot; to encourage Rearden to persevere in his increasingly difficult situation. Danneskjöld is married to the actress Kay Ludlow; their relationship is kept hidden from the outside world, which only knows of Ludlow as a [[film star]] who retired and dropped out of sight. It is mentioned that some of the strikers have strong reservations about his way of &quot;conducting the common struggle.&quot;

According to [[Barbara Branden]], who was closely associated with Rand at the time the book was written, there were sections written describing Danneskjöld's adventures at sea, which were cut from the final published text.&lt;ref&gt;Reedstrom, Karen. [http://barbarabranden.com/interview4.html 1992 Interview with Full Context]. Barbara Branden interview in ''Full Context'', October 1992. Republished on barbarabranden.com. Retrieved 1 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1974 comment at a lecture, Ayn Rand admitted that Danneskjöld's name was a tribute to Victor Hugo. The hero of Hugo's novel, ''Hans of Iceland'', becomes the first of the Counts of Danneskjöld. In the published book, Danneskjöld is always seen through the eyes of others (Dagny Taggart or Hank Rearden), except for a brief paragraph in the very last chapter.

===Antagonists===

====James Taggart====
The President of Taggart Transcontinental and the book's most important antagonist. Taggart is an expert influence peddler who is, however, incapable of making operational decisions on his own. He relies on his sister, Dagny Taggart, to actually run the railroad, but nonetheless opposes her in almost every endeavor. In a sense, he is the antithesis of Dagny.

As the novel progresses, the moral philosophy of the looters is revealed: it is a code of stagnation. The goal of this code is to not exist, to not move forward, to become a zero. Taggart struggles to remain unaware that this is his goal. He maintains his pretense that he wants to live, and becomes horrified whenever his mind starts to grasp the truth about himself. This contradiction leads to the recurring absurdity of his life: the desire to destroy those on whom his life depends, and the horror that he will succeed at this. In the final chapters of the novel, he suffers a complete mental breakdown upon realizing that he can no longer deceive himself in this respect.

====Lillian Rearden====
The unsupportive wife of Hank Rearden. They have been married eight years as the novel begins. Lillian is a frigid moocher who seeks to destroy her husband. She compares being Rearden's wife with owning the world's most powerful horse. Since she cannot comfortably ride a horse that goes too fast, she must bridle it down to her level, even if that means it will never reach its full potential and its power will be grievously wasted. Lillian tolerates sex with her husband only because she is &quot;realistic&quot; enough to know he is just a brute who requires satisfaction of his brute instincts. She indicates that she abhors Francisco d'Anconia, because she believes he is a sexual adventurer.

As her motives become more clear, Lillian is found to share the sentiments of many other moochers and their worship of destruction. Her actions are explained as the desire to destroy achievement in the false belief that such an act bestows a greatness to the destroyer equal to the accomplishment destroyed. She seeks, then, to ruin Rearden in an effort to prove her own value.

Lillian achieves her goal to destroy Rearden's business, when she passes on information to James Taggart about her husband's affair. This information is used to persuade Rearden to sign the Gift Certificate (which delivers all the property rights of Rearden Metal to the looters) and thereby destroys his business. Lillian discovers that she can accomplish her goal to destroy the business but she can neither achieve the greatness she desires nor her goal to destroy Hank's character. She uses James Taggart for sex as victory and revenge against Hank and Dagny. This does give her the satisfaction she desires and she continues to manipulate Hank until he finally leaves her and joins Galt's strikers.

====Dr. Floyd Ferris====

Ferris is a biologist who works as &quot;co-ordinator&quot; at the State Science Institute. He uses his position there to deride reason and productive achievement, and publishes a book entitled ''Why Do You Think You Think?'' He clashes on several occasions with Hank Rearden, and twice attempts to blackmail Rearden into giving up Rearden Metal. He is also one of the group of looters who tries to get Rearden to agree to the Steel Unification Plan. Ferris hosts the demonstration of the Project X weapon, and is the creator of the Ferris Persuader, a torture machine. When John Galt is captured by the looters, Ferris uses the device on Galt, but it breaks down before extracting the information Ferris wants from Galt. Ferris represents the group which uses brute force on the heroes to achieve the ends of the looters.

====Dr. Robert Stadler====
A former professor at Patrick Henry University, and along with colleague Hugh Akston, mentor to Francisco d'Anconia, John Galt and Ragnar Danneskjöld. He has since become a sell-out, one who had great promise but squandered it for social approval, to the detriment of the free. He works at the State Science Institute where all his inventions are perverted for use by the military, including the instrument of his demise: Project X (Xylophone). The character was, in part, modeled on [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], whom Rand had interviewed for an earlier project, and his part in the creation of [[nuclear weapons]].&lt;ref&gt;David Harriman, ''[[Journals of Ayn Rand]]'', pp. 311-344, esp. 330-331.&lt;/ref&gt; To his former student Galt, Stadler represents the epitome of human evil, as the &quot;man who knew better&quot; but chose not to act for the good.

====Wesley Mouch====
The incompetent and treacherous lobbyist whom Hank Rearden reluctantly employs in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], who rises to prominence and authority throughout the novel through trading favours and disloyalty. In return for betraying Hank by helping broker the Equalization of Opportunity Bill (which, by restricting the number of businesses each person may own to one, forces Hank to divest most of his companies), he is given a senior position at the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources. Later in the novel he becomes its Top Co-ordinator, a position that eventually becomes Economic Dictator of the country.

==Secondary characters==
The following secondary characters also appear in the novel.&lt;ref&gt;Secondary characters are listed if they appear in character lists from any of the works used to establish the list of major characters above, but do not meet the criteria for &quot;major.&quot; Minor characters who are not listed in secondary works are not listed here.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Hugh Akston''' is identified as &quot;One of the last great advocates of reason.&quot; He was a renowned philosopher and the head of the Department of Philosophy at Patrick Henry University, where he taught Francisco d'Anconia, John Galt, and Ragnar Danneskjöld. He was, along with Robert Stadler, a father figure to these three. Akston's name is so hallowed that a young lady, on hearing that Francisco had studied under him, is shocked. She thought he must have been one of those great names from an earlier century. He now works as a cook in a roadside diner, and proves extremely skillful at that. When Dagny tracks him down, and before she discovers his true identity, he rejects her enthusiastic offer to manage the dining car services for Taggart Transcontinental. He is based on [[Aristotle]].
*'''Jeff Allen''' is a tramp who stows away on a Taggart train during one of Dagny's cross-country trips. Instead of throwing him out, she allows him to ride as her guest. It is from Allen that she learns the full story behind the collapse of the Twentieth Century Motor Company (Rand's extensive metaphor for the inherent flaws of communism), as well as a hint of John Galt's true background.
*'''Calvin Atwood''' is owner of Atwood Light and Power Company and joins Galt's strike.
*'''Mayor Bascom''' is the mayor of Rome, Wisconsin, who reveals part of the history of the Twentieth Century Motor Company.
*'''Bill Brent''' is the chief dispatcher for the Colorado Division of Taggart Transcontinental, who tries to prevent the Taggart Tunnel disaster.
*'''Dr. Blodgett''' is the scientist who pulls the lever to demonstrate Project X.
*'''Orren Boyle''' is the head of Associated Steel, antithesis of Hank Rearden and a friend of James Taggart. He is an investor in the San Sebastián Mines. He disappears from the story after having a nervous breakdown following the failed 'unification' of the steel industry.
*'''Laura Bradford''' is an actress and Kip Chalmers's mistress.
*'''Cherryl Brooks''' is a dime store shopgirl who marries James Taggart after a chance encounter in her store the night the John Galt Line was falsely deemed his greatest success. She marries him thinking he is the heroic person behind Taggart Transcontinental. Cherryl is at first harsh towards Dagny, having believed Jim Taggart's descriptions of his sister, until she questions employees of the railroad. Upon learning that her scorn had been misdirected, Cherryl puts off apologizing to Dagny out of shame until the night before she commits suicide, when she confesses to Dagny that when she married Jim, she thought he had the heroic qualities that she had looked up to - she thought she was marrying someone like Dagny. She eventually commits suicide, unable to live with her worthless husband, and unable to escape.
*'''Millie Bush''' was &quot;a mean, ugly little eight-year-old&quot; girl voted to receive gold braces to straighten her teeth by the Marxist &quot;family&quot; committee who determined how pay was allocated at The Twentieth Century Motor Company. Her teeth are later knocked out by a man denied an allowance by the committee to purchase the things he valued.
*'''Kip Chalmers''' is a Washington man who has decided to run for election as Legislator from California. On the way to his campaign, the Taggart Transcontinental train that is carrying him encounters a split rail, resulting in the destruction of its diesel engine. His demands lead to a coal-burning steam engine being attached to his train in its stead and used to pull it through an eight-mile tunnel. The result is the suffocation of all passengers and the destruction of the Taggart Tunnel.
*'''Emma Chalmers''', Kip Chalmers's mother, gains some influence after his death. Known as &quot;Kip's Ma,&quot; she starts a soybean-growing project in Louisiana and commandeers thousands of railcars to move the harvest. As a result, the year's wheat crop from Minnesota never reaches the rest of the country, but instead rots in storage; also, the soybean crop is lost, having been reaped too early.
*'''Dan Conway''' is the middle-aged president of the Phoenix-Durango railroad. Running a railroad is just about the only thing he knows. When the Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule is used to drive his business out of [[Colorado]], he loses the will to fight, and resigns himself to a quiet life of books and fishing.
*'''Ken Danagger''' owns Danagger Coal in Pennsylvania. He helps Hank Rearden illegally make Rearden Metal, then later decides to quit and join Galt's strike moments before Dagny arrives to try to persuade him otherwise.
*'''Quentin Daniels''' is an enterprising engineer hired by Dagny Taggart to reconstruct John Galt's motor. Partway through this process, Quentin withdraws his effort for the same reasons John Galt himself had. Dagny's pursuit of Quentin leads her to Galt's Gulch.
*'''Sebastian d'Anconia''' was the 16th (or 17th) Century founder of the d'Anconia dynasty. Escaped from Spain because of expressing his opinions too freely and coming in conflict with the [[Inquisition]], leaving behind a palace and his beloved. Started a small mine in South America, which became the beginning of a mining empire and a new fortune (and a new palace). Eventually sent for his beloved who had waited for him many years. He is the role model which Francisco d'Anconia looks to, as Dagny Taggart looks to Nathaniel Taggart. Francisco remarks that their respective ancestors would have liked each other.
*'''Balph Eubank''' is called &quot;the literary leader of the age&quot;, despite the fact that he has never sold more than three thousand copies of his books. He complains that it is disgraceful that artists are treated as peddlers, and that there should be a law limiting the sales of books to ten thousand copies. He is a [[misogynist]] who thinks it disgusting that Dagny Taggart is a railroad president.
*The '''Fishwife''' is one of the strikers, who earns her living by providing the fish for Hammond’s grocery market; she is described as having &quot;dark, disheveled hair and large eyes&quot;, and is a writer. Galt says she &quot;wouldn't be published outside. She believes that when one deals with words, one deals with the mind.&quot; According to Barbara Branden in her book ''[[The Passion of Ayn Rand]]'', &quot;The [[Fishwife]] is Ayn's [[List of Hitchcock cameo appearances|Hitchcock-like]] appearance in ''Atlas Shrugged''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Branden1986&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Branden|title=The passion of Ayn Rand|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=B-AEAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=24 October 2010|date=20 May 1986|publisher=Doubleday|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; So says too Leonard Peikoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Leonard Peikoff |url=http://www.peikoff.com/2012/09/10/in-atlas-shrugged-when-john-is-giving-dagny-the-tour |title=In Atlas Shrugged, when John is giving Dagny the tour of the valley, there is a character briefly introduced who is identified as a writer and who matches Ayn Rand’s physical description. Did Ayn Rand intend this character to be a representation of herself? « Podcast « Peikoff |publisher=Peikoff.com |date=10 September 2012 |accessdate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Lawrence Hammond''' runs Hammond Cars in Colorado, one of the few companies in existence that still produces top-quality vehicles. He eventually quits and joins the strike.
*'''Richard Halley''' is Dagny Taggart's favorite composer, who mysteriously disappeared after the evening of his greatest triumph. Halley spent years as a struggling and unappreciated composer. At age 24, his opera ''[[Phaethon]]'' was performed for the first time, to an audience who booed and heckled it. After 19 years, Phaethon was performed again, but this time it was received to the greatest ovation the opera house had ever heard. The following day, Halley retired, sold the rights to his music, and disappeared. It is later revealed that he has joined the strike and settled in Galt's Gulch.
*'''Mrs. William Hastings''' is the widow of the chief engineer at the Twentieth Century Motor Company. Her husband quit shortly after Galt did and joined the strike some years later. Her lead allows Dagny to find Hugh Akston.
*'''Dr. Thomas Hendricks''' is a famous brain surgeon who developed a new method of preventing strokes. He joined Galt's strike when the American medical system was put under government control.
*'''Tinky Holloway''' is one of the &quot;looters&quot; and is frequently referred to and quoted by other characters in the story, but he has only one major appearance: during the Washington meeting with Hank Rearden.
*'''Lee Hunsacker''' is in charge of a company called Amalgamated Service when takes over the Twentieth Century Motor Company. He files a lawsuit that eventually leads to Midas Mulligan and Judge Narragansett joining the strike. A failed businessman, he laments constantly that no-one ever gave him a chance.
*'''Gwen Ives''' is Hank Rearden's secretary.
*'''Owen Kellogg''' is Assistant to the Manager of the Taggart Terminal in New York. He catches Dagny Taggart's eye as one of the few competent men on staff. After seeing the sorry state of the Ohio Division, she decides to make him its new Superintendent. However, as soon as she returns to New York, Kellogg informs her that he is quitting his job. Owen Kellogg eventually reaches, and settles in, Galt's Gulch.
*'''Fred Kinnan''' is a labor leader and member of the looter cabal. Unlike the others, however, Kinnan is straightforward and honest about his purpose. Kinnan is the only one to openly state the true motivations of himself and his fellow conspirators. At the end of Galt's 3 hour speech, he expresses admiration for the man, as he says what he means. Despite this, Kinnan admits that he is one of the people Galt is out to destroy.
*'''Paul Larkin''' is an unsuccessful, middle-aged businessman, a friend of the Rearden family. He meets with the other Looters to work out a plan to bring Rearden down. James Taggart knows he is friends with Hank Rearden and challenges his loyalty, and Larkin assures Taggart that he will go along with them.
*'''Eugene Lawson''' heads the Community Bank of Madison, then gets a job with the government when it his bank goes bankrupt. One of the looter's cabal, he is a collectivist who abhors production and money-making.

*'''Dick McNamara''' is a contractor who finished the San Sebastian Line. Dagny Taggart plans to hire him to lay the new Rearden Metal track for the Rio Norte Line, but before she does so, he mysteriously disappears. She later discovers that he has joined the strike and settled in Galt's Gulch.
*'''Cuffy Meigs''' is the Director of Unification for the railroad business. He carries a pistol and a lucky rabbit's foot, and he dresses in a military uniform, and has been described as &quot;impervious to thought&quot;. Meigs seizes control of Project X and accidentally destroys it, demolishing the country's last railroad bridge across the Mississippi River and killing himself, his men, and Dr. Stadler.
*'''Dave Mitchum''' is a state-hired superintendent of the Colorado Division of Taggart Transcontinental. He is partially responsible for the Taggart Tunnel disaster.
*'''Chick Morrison''' holds the position of &quot;Morale Conditioner&quot; in the government. He quits when society begins to collapse and flees to a stronghold in Tennessee. His fellow looters consider it unlikely that he will survive.
*'''Horace Bussby Mowen''' is the president of the Amalgamated Switch and Signal Company, Inc. of Connecticut. He is a businessman who sees nothing wrong with the moral code that is destroying society and would never dream of saying he is in business for any reason other than the good of society. Dagny Taggart hires Mowen to produce switches made of Rearden Metal. He is reluctant to build anything with this unproven technology, and has to be cajoled into accepting the contract. When pressured by public opinion, he discontinues production of the switches, forcing Dagny to find an alternative source.
*'''Midas Mulligan''' is a wealthy banker who mysteriously disappeared in protest after he was given a court order to lend money to an incompetent applicant. When the order came down he liquidated his entire business, paid off his depositors, and joined Galt's strike. He is the legal owner of the land where Galt's Gulch is located. Mulligan's birth name was Michael, but he had it legally changed after a news article called him &quot;[[Midas]]&quot; in a derogatory fashion, which Mulligan took as a compliment.
*'''Judge Narragansett''' is an American jurist who ruled in favor of Midas Mulligan during the case brought against him by the incompetent loan applicant. When Narragansett's ruling was reversed on appeal, he retired and joined the strike. At the end of the novel, he is seen editing the [[United States Constitution]], crossing out the contradicting amendments of it and adding an amendment to prohibit Congress from passing laws that restrain freedom of trade.
*'''Ben Nealy''' is a railroad contractor whom Dagny Taggart hires to replace the track on the Rio Norte Line with Rearden Metal. Nealy is incompetent, but Dagny can find no one better in all the country. Nealy believes that anything can get done with enough muscle power. He sees no role for intelligence in human achievement. He relies on Dagny and Ellis Wyatt to run things, and resents them for doing it, because it appears to him like they are just bossing people around.
*'''Betty Pope''' is a wealthy socialite who is having a meaningless sexual affair with James Taggart. She is deliberately crude in a way that casts ridicule on her high social position.
*'''Dr. Potter''' holds some undefined position with the State Science Institute. He is sent to try to obtain the rights to Rearden Metal.
*'''Dr. Simon Pritchett''' is the prestigious head of the Department of Philosophy at Patrick Henry University and is considered the leading philosopher of the age. He believes that man is nothing but a collection of chemicals, reason is a superstition, it is futile to seek meaning in life, and the duty of a philosopher is to show that nothing can be understood.
*'''Rearden's mother''', whose name is not mentioned, lives with Rearden at his home in Philadelphia. She is involved in charity work, and berates Rearden whenever she can. She dotes on her weak son Philip Rearden.
*'''Philip Rearden''' is the younger brother of Hank Rearden. He lives in his brother's home in Philadelphia and is completely dependent on him. He is resentful of his brother's charity.
*'''Dwight Sanders''' owns Sanders Aircraft, a producer of high-quality airplanes, and joins the strike.
*'''Bertram Scudder''' is an editorial writer for the magazine ''The Future''. He typically bashes business and businessmen, but he never says anything specific in his articles, relying on innuendo, sneers, and denunciation. He wrote a hatchet job on Hank Rearden called ''The Octopus''. He is also vocal in support of the Equalization of Opportunity Bill. Scudder claims that the most important thing in life is &quot;brother love&quot; but seems to have nothing but hatred for those around him. He loses his job after Dagny Taggart reveals her affair with Hank Rearden over air on his radio show.
*'''Claude Slagenhop''' is president of political organization Friends of Global Progress and one of Lillian Rearden's friends. He believes that ideas are just air, that this is no time for talk, but for action. Global Progress is a sponsor of the Equalization of Opportunity Bill.
*'''Gerald and Ivy Starnes''' are the two surviving children of Jed Starnes; together with their since-deceased brother Eric, they instituted a communistic payment-and-benefits program at Twentieth Century Motors which drove the company into bankruptcy. Gerald, a dying alcoholic, and Ivy, a [[New Age|pseudo-Buddhist]] ascetic, continue to insist that the plan was perfect and that the failure of their father's company was entirely due to the workers. Eric was a weak, attention-seeking man with a pathological desire to be loved. He committed suicide after the woman he loved married another man. Gerald is a vain, frivolous incompetent who claims to be altruistic while throwing lavish parties using money that should be paid to his employees. Ivy meanwhile is described as &quot;pure evil&quot;, a sadist who revels in the poverty of others but has no desire for money or power herself.
*'''Andrew Stockton''' runs the Stockton Foundry in Stockton, Colorado. When he joins the strike, he opens a foundry in Galt's Gulch.
*'''Nathaniel Taggart''' was the founder of Taggart Transcontinental. He built his railroad without any government handouts, and ran the business for no other reason than to turn a profit. He began as a penniless adventurer and ended up as one of the wealthiest men in the country. He never earned money by force or fraud (except for bribing government officials and throwing an opponent down a flight of stairs), and never apologized for becoming wealthy and successful. He was one of the most hated men of his time. Dagny is often inspired by looking at a statue of Nat Taggart at the railroad headquarters.
*'''Mr. Thompson''' is the &quot;[[Head of State|Head of the State]]&quot; for the United States. He is not particularly intelligent and has a very undistinguished look. He knows politics, however, and is a master of public relations and back-room deals. Rand's notes indicate that she modeled him on President [[Harry S. Truman]], and that she deliberately decided not to call him &quot;President of the United States&quot; as this title has &quot;honorable connotations&quot; which the character does not deserve.
*'''Lester Tuck''' is the press agent for Kip Chalmers.
*'''Clem Weatherby''' is a government representative on the board of directors of Taggart Transcontinental. Dagny considers him the least bad of the government representatives, since he does have some real knowledge on the running of trains. She notices, however, that he is the least appreciated by his own bosses.
*The '''Wet Nurse (Tony)''' is a young bureaucrat sent by the government to watch over Rearden’s mills. Though he starts out as a cynical follower of the looters’ code, his experience at the mills transforms him, and he comes to respect and admire the producers. He is shot attempting to inform Hank Rearden about a government plot, but does succeed in warning Rearden just before he dies.
*'''Ellis Wyatt''' is the head of Wyatt Oil. He has almost single-handedly revived the economy of Colorado by discovering a new process for extracting more oil from what were thought to be exhausted oil wells. When first introduced, he is aggressive towards Dagny, whom he does not yet know and whom he blames for what are, in fact, her brother's policies which directly threaten his business. When the government passes laws and decrees which make it impossible for him to continue, he sets all his oil wells on fire, leaving a jeering note: &quot;I am leaving it as I found it. Take over. It's yours.&quot; One particular burning well that resists all efforts to extinguish it becomes known as &quot;Wyatt's Torch&quot;. Later Dagny meets him in Galt's Gulch.

{{Anthropology}}
'''Anthropology''' {{IPAc-en|æ|n|θ|r|ɵ|ˈ|p|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}} is the study of [[humankind]], past and present,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Anthropology|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/anthropology?q=anthropology|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/27505/anthropology &quot;anthropology&quot;] at Britannica Online Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; that draws and builds upon knowledge from [[social science|social]] and [[biological science]]s, as well as the [[humanities]] and the [[natural science]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Anthropology?|url=http://www.aaanet.org/about/whatisanthropology.cfm|publisher=American Anthropological Association|accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Eric (1994) ''Perilous Ideas: Race, Culture, People.'' ''[[Current Anthropology]]'' 35: 1-7. p.227&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the work of [[Franz Boas]] and [[Bronisław Malinowski]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, anthropology in Great Britain and the US has been distinguished from [[ethnology]]&lt;ref&gt;Han F. Vermeulen, &quot;The German Invention of ''Völkerkunde:'' Ethnological Discourse in Europe and Asia, 1740–1798.&quot; In: Sara Eigen and Mark Larrimore, eds. ''The German Invention of Race.'' 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and from other social sciences by its emphasis on [[cross-cultural studies|cross-cultural comparisons]], long-term in-depth examination of context, and the importance it places on [[Participant observation|participant-observation]] or experiential immersion in the area of research. Cultural anthropology in particular has emphasized [[cultural relativism]], [[holism]], and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hylland Eriksen 2004 p. 79&quot;&gt;Hylland Eriksen, Thomas. (2004) &quot;What is Anthropology&quot; Pluto. London. p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been particularly prominent in the United States, from Boas's arguments against 19th-century racial ideology, through [[Margaret Mead]]'s advocacy for gender equality and sexual liberation, to current criticisms of [[post-colonialism|post-colonial]] oppression and promotion of [[multiculturalism]]. [[Ethnography]] is one of its primary methods as well as the text that is generated from anthropological fieldwork.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ingold1994p331&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spiro1987&quot;&gt;On varieties of cultural relativism in anthropology, see Spiro, Melford E. (1987) &quot;Some Reflections on Cultural Determinism and Relativism with Special Reference to Emotion and Reason,&quot; in ''Culture and Human Nature: theoretical papers of Melford E. Spiro''. Edited by B. Kilborne and L. L. Langness, pp.&amp;nbsp;32–58. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heyck1997&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heyck|first1=Thomas William|last2=Stocking|first2=George W.|last3=Goody|first3=Jack|title=After Tylor: British Social Anthropology 1888–1951.|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=102|issue=5|year=1997|pages=1486–1488|issn=00028762|doi=10.2307/2171126|jstor=2171126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Great Britain and the Commonwealth countries, the British tradition of [[Social Anthropology]] tends to dominate, in the United States anthropology is traditionally divided into the [[four field approach]] developed by [[Franz Boas]] in the early 20th century: [[Biological anthropology|biological or physical anthropology]], [[social anthropology]] or [[cultural anthropology]], [[archaeology]] and [[linguistic anthropology|anthropological linguistics]]. These fields frequently overlap, but tend to use different methodologies and techniques.

In those European countries that did not have overseas colonies, where [[ethnology]] (a term coined and defined by [[Adam František Kollár|Adam F. Kollár]] in 1783) was more widespread, [[social anthropology]] is now defined as the study of social organization in non-state societies and is sometimes referred to as sociocultural anthropology in the parts of the world that were influenced by the European tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Layton, Robert (1998) ''An Introduction to Theory in Anthropology''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term==
The term ''[[wiktionary:anthropology|anthropology]]'' originates from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''anthrōpos'' ({{lang|grc|ἄνθρωπος}}), &quot;human being&quot; (understood to mean humankind or humanity), and -λογία ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'', &quot;study.&quot;

==Fields==
{{further|American anthropology}}

Anthropology is a global discipline where humanities, social, and natural sciences are forced to confront one another. Anthropology builds upon knowledge from [[natural sciences]], including the discoveries about the origin and evolution of ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]'', human physical traits, [[human behavior]], the variations among different groups of humans, how the evolutionary past of ''Homo sapiens'' has influenced its social organization and culture, and from [[social sciences]], including the organization of human social and cultural relations, institutions, social conflicts, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/about/WhatisAnthropology.cfm What is Anthropology - American Anthropological Association]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://anthropologyreport.com/what-is-anthropology/ What is Anthropology - Anthropology Report]&lt;/ref&gt; Early anthropology originated in Classical Greece and Persia and studied and tried to understand observable cultural diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Marvin. ''The Rise of Anthropological Theory''.  Alta Mira Press. 2000 (revised from 1968); Harris, Marvin.  ''Theories of Culture in Postmodern Times. Altamira. 1998''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ahmed&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ahmed | first1 = Akbar S. | year = 1984 | title = Al-Beruni: The First Anthropologist | url = | journal = RAIN | volume = 60 | issue = 60| pages = 9–10 | doi = 10.2307/3033407 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, anthropology has been central in the development of several new (late 20th century) interdisciplinary fields such as [[cognitive science]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Language, Anthropology and Cognitive Science |author=Bloch, Maurice |authorlink=Maurice Bloch |jstor=2803828 |year=1991 |publisher=London School of Economics and Political Science |pages=183–198 |volume=26 |issue=2 |journal=Man |doi=10.2307/2803828 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[global studies]], and various [[ethnic studies]].

According to [[Clifford Geertz]], 
{{quotation|&quot;anthropology is perhaps the last of the great nineteenth-century conglomerate disciplines still for the most part organizationally intact. Long after natural history, moral philosophy, philology, and political economy have dissolved into their specialized successors, it has remained a diffuse assemblage of ethnology, human biology, comparative linguistics, and prehistory, held together mainly by the vested interests, sunk costs, and administrative habits of academia, and by a romantic image of comprehensive scholarship.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Unwrapping the Sacred Bundle|year=2005|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham and London|pages=Back Cover|editor=Daniel A. Segal &amp; Sylvia J. Yanagisako}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sociocultural anthropology has been heavily influenced by [[structuralism|structuralist]] and postmodern theories, as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies. During the 1970s and 1990s, there was an [[epistemological]] shift away from the [[positivist]] traditions that had largely informed the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, Behar, Clifford &amp; James&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2012}} During this shift, enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology. In contrast, archaeology and biological anthropology remained largely positivist. Due to this difference in epistemology, the four sub-fields of anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last several decades.

===Sociocultural===
{{main|Cultural anthropology|Social anthropology}}
Sociocultural anthropology draws together the principle axes of [[cultural anthropology]] and [[social anthropology]]. Cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people ''make sense'' of the world around them, while social anthropology is the study of the ''relationships'' among persons and groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ingold1994pxv&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=GENERAL INTRODUCTION | encyclopedia=Companion Encyclopedia of Anthropology | author=[[Tim Ingold]] | editor=Tim Ingold | year=1994 | pages=xv | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural anthropology is more akin to [[philosophy]], literature and [[the arts]], while social anthropology to [[sociology]] and history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ingold1994pxv&quot;/&gt;

Inquiry in sociocultural anthropology is guided in part by [[cultural relativism]], the attempt to understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ingold1994p331&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Introduction to culture | encyclopedia=Companion Encyclopedia of Anthropology | author=[[Tim Ingold]] | editor=Tim Ingold | year=1994 | page=331 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accepting other cultures in their own terms moderates reductionism in cross-cultural comparison.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ingold1996p18&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Key Debates In Anthropology | author=[[Tim Ingold]]  | year=1996|  page=18|quote=the traditional anthropological project of cross-cultural or cross-societal comparison}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project is often accommodated in the field of [[ethnography]]. Ethnography can refer to both a methodology and a product of research, namely a monograph or book. As methodology, ethnography is based upon long-term fieldwork within a community or other research site. [[Participant observation]] is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard, H. Russell, ''Research Methods in Anthropology''. Altamira Press, 2002. p.322.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ethnology]] involves the systematic comparison of different cultures. The process of participant-observation can be especially helpful to understanding a culture from an [[emic]] (conceptual, vs. [[etic]],  or technical) point of view.

The study of [[kinship]] and [[social organization]] is a central focus of sociocultural anthropology, as kinship is a [[human universal]]. Sociocultural anthropology also covers [[Economic anthropology|economic]] and [[Political anthropology|political organization]], law and conflict resolution, patterns of consumption and exchange, material culture, technology, infrastructure, gender relations, ethnicity, childrearing and socialization, religion, myth, symbols, values, etiquette, worldview, sports, music, nutrition, recreation, games, food, festivals, and language (which is also the object of study in linguistic anthropology).

Comparison across cultures is a key element of method in sociocultural anthropology, including the industrialized (and de-industrialized) West.

===Biological===
{{main|Biological anthropology}}
[[File:Human remains.jpg|thumb|left|Forensic anthropologists can help identify skeletonized human remains, such as these found lying in scrub in Western Australia, c. 1900–1910.]]

Biological Anthropology and Physical Anthropology are synonymous terms to describe anthropological research focused on the study of humans and non-human primates in their biological, evolutionary, and demographic dimensions. It examines the biological and social factors that have affected the evolution of humans and other primates, and that generate, maintain or change contemporary genetic and physiological variation.&lt;ref&gt;University of Toronto. (n.d.). ''Research Subfields: Physical or Biological''. Retrieved 14 March 2012, from http://anthropology.utoronto.ca/about/research/physical-or-biological&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeological===
{{main|Archaeology}}
[[File:Iowa archaeology edgewater.JPG|thumb|Excavations at the 3800-year-old [[Edgewater Park Site]], [[Iowa]]]]
[[Archaeology]] is the study of the human past through its material remains.  Artifacts, faunal remains, and human altered landscapes are evidence of the cultural and material lives of past societies.  Archaeologists examine these material remains in order to deduce patterns of past human behavior and cultural practices.  Ethnoarchaeology is a type of archaeology that studies the practices and material remains of living human groups in order to gain a better understanding of the evidence left behind by past human groups, who are presumed to have lived in similar ways.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, R. H. &amp; Larkin, S. N. (2007). Cultural Anthropology: A problem based approach. Toronto, ON: Nelson Education Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linguistic===
{{main|Linguistic anthropology}}
[[Linguistic anthropology]] (also called [[anthropological linguistics]]) seeks to understand the processes of human communications, verbal and non-verbal, variation in [[language]] across time and space, the social uses of language, and the relationship between language and culture. It is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems, linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes. Linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including [[sociolinguistics]], [[pragmatics]], [[cognitive linguistics]], [[semiotics]], [[discourse analysis]], and [[narrative]] analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Salzmann, Zdeněk. (1993) ''Language, culture, and society: an introduction to linguistic anthropology''. Boulder, CO: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key topics by field: sociocultural==

===Art, media, music, dance and film===
{{Anthropology of art}}

==== Art ====
{{main|Anthropology of art}}

One of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of 'art' as a cultural phenomenon. Several anthropologists have noted that the Western categories of 'painting', 'sculpture', or 'literature', conceived as independent artistic activities, do not exist, or exist in a significantly different form, in most non-Western contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Layton. (1981) ''The Anthropology of Art''.&lt;/ref&gt; To surmount this difficulty, anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which, without exclusively being 'artistic', have certain evident 'aesthetic' qualities. Boas' ''Primitive Art'', Claude Lévi-Strauss' ''The Way of the Masks'' (1982) or Geertz's 'Art as Cultural System' (1983) are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of 'art' into an anthropology of culturally specific 'aesthetics'.

==== Media ====
{{main|Media anthropology}}
[[File:Punu mask Gabon.JPG|thumb|upright|left|A Punu tribe mask. Gabon West Africa]]
Anthropology of media (also '''anthropology of mass media''', '''media anthropology''') emphasizes [[ethnography|ethnographic studies]] as a means of understanding producers, audiences, and other cultural and social aspects of mass media. The types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production (e.g., ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers, journalists in the field, film production) to contexts of media reception, following audiences in their everyday responses to media.  Other types include [[cyber anthropology]], a relatively new area of [[internet research]], as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media, such as development work, [[social movements]], or health education. This is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts, where media such as radio, [[newspaper|the press]], [[new media]] and television have started to make their presences felt since the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Spitulnik. (1993) 'Anthropology and Mass Media', ''Annual Review of Anthropology'', 22: 293-315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lila Abu-Lughod. (1997) 'The Interpretation of Cultures after Television', ''Representations'', 59: 109-133&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Music ====
{{main|Ethnomusicology}}
Ethnomusicology is an academic field encompassing various approaches to the study of music (broadly defined), that emphasize its cultural, social, material, cognitive, biological, and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire.

==== Visual ====
{{main|Visual anthropology}}
Visual anthropology  is concerned, in part, with the study and production of [[ethnography|ethnographic]] photography, film and, since the mid-1990s, [[new media]].  While the term is sometimes used interchangeably with [[ethnographic film]], visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual representation, including areas such as performance, museums, art, and the production and [[reception theory|reception]] of [[anthropology of media|mass media]].  Visual representations from all cultures, such as sandpaintings, tattoos, sculptures and reliefs, cave paintings, scrimshaw, jewelry, hieroglyphics, paintings and photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology.

=== Economic, political economic, applied and development ===
{{Economic anthropology}}

==== Economic ====
{{main|Economic anthropology}}
Economic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic, geographic and cultural scope. It has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics, of which it is highly critical. Its origins as a sub-field of anthropology begin with the Polish-British founder of Anthropology, [[Bronislaw Malinowski]], and his French compatriot, [[Marcel Mauss]], on the nature of gift-giving exchange (or [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]]) as an alternative to market exchange. Economic Anthropology remains, for the most part, focused upon exchange. The school of thought derived from Marx and known as Political Economy focuses on production, in contrast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hann|first=Chris|title=Economic Anthropology|year=2011|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=55–71|author2=Keith Hart}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic Anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists, and have now turned to examine corporations, banks, and the global financial system from an anthropological perspective.

====Political economy====
{{main|Political economy in anthropology}}
Political economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of [[Historical Materialism]] to the traditional concerns of anthropology, including, but not limited to, non-capitalist societies. Political Economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture. Three main areas of interest rapidly developed. The first of these areas was concerned with the &quot;pre-capitalist&quot; societies that were subject to evolutionary &quot;tribal&quot; stereotypes. Sahlins work on Hunter-gatherers as the 'original affluent society' did much to dissipate that image. The second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world's population at the time, the peasantry, many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in Vietnam. The third area was on colonialism, imperialism, and the creation of the capitalist world-system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roseberry 1988 161–85&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Political Economy|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|pages=161–85|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.17.100188.001113}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, these Political Economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial (and post-industrial) capitalism around the world.

==== Applied ====
{{main|Applied anthropology}}
Applied Anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems. It is a, &quot;complex of related, research-based, instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data, initiation of direct action, and/or the formulation of policy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kedia, Satish|first=and Willigen J. Van|title=Applied Anthropology: Domains of Application|year=2005|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, Conn|pages=16, 150}}&lt;/ref&gt; More simply, applied anthropology is the practical side of anthropological research; it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community. It is closely related to [[Development anthropology]] (distinct from the more critical [[Anthropology of development]]).

====Development====
{{main|anthropology of development}}
Anthropology of development  tends to view development from a ''critical'' perspective. The kind of issues addressed and implications for the approach  involve asking why, if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty, is poverty increasing? Why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes? Why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer? Why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis? In short why does so much planned development fail?

===Kinship, feminism, gender and sexuality===
{{Anthropology of kinship}}

==== Kinship ====
{{main|Kinship}}
''Kinship'' can refer both to ''the study of'' the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures, or it can refer to ''the patterns of social relationships'' themselves. Over its history, anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms, such as '''descent''', '''descent groups''', '''lineages''', '''affines''', '''cognates''' and even '''fictive kinship.''' Broadly, kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent (one's social relations during development), and also relatives by marriage.

==== Feminist ====
{{main|Feminist anthropology}}
Feminist anthropology is a four field approach to anthropology ([[archaeology|archeological]], [[biological anthropology|biological]], [[cultural anthropology|cultural]], [[linguistic anthropology|linguistic]]) that seeks to reduce male bias in research findings, anthropological hiring practices, and the scholarly production of knowledge. Anthropology engages often with feminists from non-Western traditions, whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white European and American feminists. Historically, such 'peripheral' perspectives have sometimes been marginalized and regarded as less valid or important than knowledge from the [[western world]]. Feminist anthropologists have claimed that their research helps to correct this systematic bias in mainstream [[feminist theory]]. Feminist anthropologists are centrally concerned with the construction of gender across societies. Feminist anthropology is inclusive of [http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/2940.html birth anthropology] as a specialization.

===Medical, nutritional, psychological, cognitive and transpersonal===
{{Medical anthropology}}

==== Medical ====
{{main|Medical anthropology}}

Medical anthropology is an interdisciplinary field which studies &quot;human health and disease, health care systems, and biocultural adaptation&quot;.&lt;ref name=McElroy1996&gt;{{Cite book |year=1996 |author=McElroy, A |chapter=Medical Anthropology |editor=D. Levinson &amp; M. Ember |title=Encyclopedia of Cultural Anthropology |url=http://www.univie.ac.at/ethnomedicine/PDF/Medical%20Anthropologie.pdf |isbn= |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to &quot;.&quot; for the cite to end in a &quot;.&quot;, as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, research in medical anthropology is one of the main growth areas in the field of anthropology as a whole. It focuses on  the following six basic fields:{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* the development of systems of medical knowledge and medical care
* the patient-physician relationship
* the integration of alternative medical systems in culturally diverse environments
* the interaction of social, environmental and biological factors which influence health and illness both in the individual and the community as a whole
*the critical analysis of interaction between psychiatric services and migrant populations (&quot;critical ethnopsychiatry&quot;: Beneduce 2004, 2007)
* the impact of biomedicine and biomedical technologies in non-Western settings
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other subjects that have become central to medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering (Farmer, 1999, 2003; Beneduce, 2010) as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not a result of illness. On the other hand, there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and theoretical production, such as ''cultural psychiatry'' and ''transcultural psychiatry'' or ''ethnopsychiatry''.

==== Nutritional ====
{{main|Nutritional anthropology}}

Nutritional anthropology is a synthetic concept that deals with the interplay between [[economic systems]], [[nutrition|nutritional status]] and [[food security]], and how changes in the former affect the latter. If economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food, food security, and dietary health, then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization. Nutritional status affects overall health status, work performance potential, and the overall potential for economic development (either in terms of human development or traditional western models) for any given group of people.

==== Psychological ====
{{main|Psychological anthropology}}
Psychological anthropology is an interdisciplinary subfield of anthropology that studies the interaction of [[cultural anthropology|cultural]] and [[psychology|mental processes]]. This subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans' development and [[enculturation]] within a particular cultural group—with its own history, language, practices, and conceptual categories—shape processes of human [[cognition]], [[emotion]], [[perception]], [[motivation]], and [[mental health]]. It also examines how the understanding of cognition, emotion, motivation, and similar psychological processes inform or constrain our models of cultural and social processes.&lt;ref&gt;D'Andrade, R. G. (1995). The development of cognitive anthropology. New York, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, T., G. M. White, et al., Eds. (1992). New Directions in Psychological Anthropology. Cambridge, UK, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cognitive ====
{{main|Cognitive anthropology}}
Cognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge, cultural [[innovation]], and transmission over time and space using the methods and [[theories]] of the [[cognitive sciences]] (especially [[experimental psychology]] and [[evolutionary biology]]) often through close collaboration with historians, ethnographers, archaeologists, linguists, musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of cultural forms. Cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|D'Andrade|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Transpersonal ====
{{main|Transpersonal anthropology}}
Transpersonal anthropology studies the relationship between [[altered states of consciousness]] and culture. As with [[transpersonal psychology]], the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness (ASC) and [[transpersonal experience]]. However, the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross-cultural issues—for instance, the roles of [[Mythology|myth]], [[ritual]], [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], and [[Literature|texts]] in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences (Young and Goulet 1994).

===Political and legal===
{{Political anthropology}}

==== Political ====
{{main|Political anthropology}}
Political anthropology concerns the structure of [[Form of government|political systems]], looked at from the basis of the structure of societies. Political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies, a new development started from the 1960s, and is still unfolding: anthropologists started increasingly to study more &quot;complex&quot; social settings in which the presence of states, bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena. The turn towards complex societies meant that political themes  were taken up at two main levels. First of all, anthropologists continued to study [[political organization]] and political phenomena that lay outside the state-regulated sphere (as in patron-client relations or tribal political organization). Second of all, anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions (and of course on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions). An anthropology of the state developed, and it is a most thriving field today. Geertz' comparative work on &quot;Negara&quot;, the Balinese state is an early, famous example.

====Legal====
{{main|Legal anthropology}}
Legal anthropology, also known as '''Anthropology of Law''' specializes in &quot;the cross-cultural study of social ordering&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Greenhouse, Carol J. | title = Praying for Justice: Faith, Order, and Community in an American Town | location = Ithaca | publisher = Cornell UP | year = 1986 | page = 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Earlier legal anthropological research often focused more narrowly on conflict management, crime, sanctions, or formal regulation. More  recent applications include issues such as [[Human Rights]], [[Legal pluralism]], [[Islamaphobia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowen|first=John R.|title=A New Anthropology of Islam|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Political theologies: public religions in a post-secular world|year=2006|publisher=Fordham University Press|location=New York|editor=Hent de Vries and Lawrence E. Sullivan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Political Uprisings.

====Public====
{{main|Public anthropology}}
Public Anthropology was created by Robert Borofsky, a professor at Hawaii Pacific University, to &quot;demonstrate the ability of anthropology and anthropologists to effectively address problems beyond the discipline - illuminating larger social issues of our times as well as encouraging broad, public conversations about them with the explicit goal of fostering social change&quot; ([http://www.publicanthropology.org Borofsky 2004]).

=== Nature, science and technology===
{{Cyber anthropology}}

====Cyborg====
{{main|Cyborg anthropology}}
Cyborg anthropology originated as a sub-focus group within the [[American Anthropological Association]]'s annual meeting in 1993. The sub-group was very closely related to [[science and technology studies|STS]] and the [[Society for the Social Studies of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;Dumit, Joseph. Davis-Floyd, Robbie. Cyborg Anthropology. Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donna Haraway]]'s 1985 ''[[Cyborg Manifesto]]'' could be considered the founding document of cyborg anthropology by first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term. Cyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built, specifically modern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beings.

==== Digital ====
{{main|Digital anthropology}}
Digital anthropology is the study of the relationship between humans and digital-era technology, and extends to various areas where anthropology and [[technology]] intersect. It is sometimes grouped with [[cultural anthropology|sociocultural anthropology]], and sometimes considered part of [[material culture]].  The field is new, and thus has a variety of names with a variety of emphases. These include techno-anthropology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.studyguide.aau.dk/programmes/postgraduate/53203/ | title=Techno-Anthropology course guide | publisher=Aalborg University | accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; digital ethnography, cyberanthropology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://xirdalium.net/category/anthropology/cyberanthropology/ | title=Cyberanthropology | publisher=Peter Hammer Verlag Gmbh | date=August 2011 | accessdate=14 March 2013 | author=Knorr, Alexander | isbn=978-3-7795-0359-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and virtual anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Virtual Anthropology: A guide to a new interdisciplinary field | publisher=Springer | author=Weber, Gerhard &amp; Bookstein, Fred | year=2011 | isbn=978-3-211-48647-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ecological ====
{{main|Ecological anthropology}}
Ecological anthropology is defined as the &quot;study of [[cultural adaptation]]s to environments&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kottak&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Kottak|first=Conrad Phillip|title=Anthropology : appreciating human diversity|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-811699-5|pages=579–584|edition=14th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sub-field is also defined as, &quot;the study of relationships between a population of humans and their [[biophysical environment]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Townsend&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Townsend|first=Patricia K.|title=Environmental anthropology : from pigs to policies|year=2009|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, Ill.|isbn=978-1-57766-581-6|page=104|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of its research concerns &quot;how cultural [[beliefs]] and practices helped human populations adapt to their environments, and how people used elements of their culture to maintain their [[ecosystems]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kottak&quot;/&gt;

====Environmental====
{{main|Environmental anthropology}}
Environmental anthropology is a sub-specialty  within the field of anthropology that takes an active role in examining the relationships between humans and their environment across space and time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kottak CP 1999&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kottak|first1=Conrad P.|jstor=683339|title=The New Ecological Anthropology|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=101|page=23|year=1999|doi=10.1525/aa.1999.101.1.23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology, and arguably at least the backdrop, if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today, is [[political ecology]]. Many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture, politics and power, globalization, localized issues, and more.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pyke G 1984&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pyke|first1=G H|title=Optimal Foraging Theory: A Critical Review|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=15|page=523|year=1984|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.15.110184.002515}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for/against or creation of policy, and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land. Often, the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly (organizing, participation) or indirectly (articles, documentaries, books, ethnographies). Such is the case with environmental justice advocate Melissa Checker and her relationship with the people of Hyde Park.&lt;ref name=&quot;Checker M 2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Melissa Checker|title=Polluted promises: environmental racism and the search for justice in a southern town|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9GCcgMi40WkC|accessdate=3 April 2011|date=August 2005|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-1657-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical===
{{main|Ethnohistory}}
Ethnohistory is the study of [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] cultures and [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] customs by examining [[History|historical records]]. It is also the study of the history of various [[ethnic group]]s that may or may not exist today. Ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation. Its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts. Practitioners recognize the utility of such source material as maps, music, paintings, photography, folklore, oral tradition, site exploration, archaeological materials, museum collections, enduring customs, language, and place names.&lt;ref name=&quot;Axtell1979&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Axtell | first1 = J. | year = 1979 | title = Ethnohistory: An Historian's Viewpoint | url = | journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 3–4 | doi = 10.2307/481465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
{{Anthropology of religion}}
{{main|Anthropology of religion}}
The anthropology of religion involves the study of religious institutions in relation to other social institutions, and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures. Modern anthropology assumes that there is complete continuity between [[magical thinking]] and religion,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cassirer1944&quot;&gt;[[Ernst Cassirer|Cassirer, Ernst]] (1944) [http://books.google.com/books?id=pe9fWSv-iLsC&amp;pg=PA102 ''An Essay On Man''], pt.II, ch.7 ''Myth and Religion'', pp.&amp;nbsp;122–3. Quotation: {{quote|It seems to be one of the postulates of modern anthropology that there is complete continuity between magic and religion. [note 35: See, for instance, RR Marett, Faith, Hope, and Charity in Primitive Religion, the Gifford Lectures (Macmillan, 1932), Lecture II, pp. 21 ff.]&amp;nbsp;... We have no empirical evidence at all that there ever was an age of magic that has been followed and superseded by an age of religion.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that every religion is a cultural product, created by the human [[community]] that worships it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guthrie2000p225&quot;&gt;Guthrie (2000) [http://books.google.es/books?id=wlNJQoZlGC4C&amp;pg=PA225 pp.&amp;nbsp;225–6]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Urban ===
{{main|Urban anthropology}}
Urban anthropology is concerned with issues of [[urbanization]], poverty, and [[neoliberalism]]. [[Ulf Hannerz]] quotes a 1960s remark that traditional anthropologists were &quot;a notoriously [[agoraphobic]] lot, anti-urban by definition&quot;. Various social processes in the [[Western World]] as well as in the &quot;[[Third World]]&quot; (the latter being the habitual focus of attention of anthropologists) brought the attention of &quot;[[Anthropology#Focus on the &quot;other cultures&quot;|specialists in 'other cultures']]&quot; closer to their homes.&lt;ref&gt;Hannerz, Ulf (1980). ''Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology'', p.1&lt;/ref&gt; There are two principle approaches in urban anthropology: by examining the types of cities or examining the social issues within the cities. These two methods are overlapping and dependent of each other. By defining different types of cities, one would use social factors as well as economic and political factors to categorize the cities. By directly looking at the different social issues, one would also be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, Michael. B., Flemming Christiansen, and Malcolm Chapman. (2010) 'Chinese Consumers: The Romantic Reappraisal'. Ethnography, Sept 2010, 11, 331-357.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key topics by field: archaeological and biological==
{{main|Archaeological|Biological anthropology}}

=== Anthrozoology ===
{{main|Anthrozoology}}
Anthrozoology (also called '''human–animal studies''' or '''HAS''') is the study of interaction between living things. It is a modern [[interdisciplinary]] and burgeoning field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines, including  anthropology, [[ethology]], medicine, [[psychology]], [[veterinary medicine]] and [[zoology]].  A major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human-animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Daniel S. [http://books.google.com/books?id=vrueZDfPUzoC&amp;pg=PA28 &quot;Anthrozoology&quot;], ''The Encyclopedia of Applied Animal Behaviour and Welfare''. CABI 2010, pp. 28–30.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes scholars from a diverse range of fields, including anthropology, sociology, biology, and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;DeMello, Margo. ''Teaching the Animal: Human–Animal Studies Across the Disciplines''. Lantern Books, 2010, p. xi.
*Also see [http://www.animalsandsociety.org/content/index.php?pid=41 Animals &amp; Society Institute], accessed 23 February 2011.
*Note: the term should not be confused with &quot;animal studies,&quot; which often refers to [[animal testing]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biocultural ===
{{main|Biocultural anthropology}}
Biocultural anthropology is the [[scientific]] exploration of the relationships between [[human biology]] and culture. [[Biological anthropology|Physical anthropologists]] throughout the first half of the 20th century viewed this relationship from a [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] perspective; that is, from the assumption that [[Typology (anthropology)|typological]] human biological differences lead to cultural differences.&lt;ref name=Biocult_syn&gt;{{cite book |last= Goodman |first=Alan H. |author2= Thomas L. Leatherman (eds.) |title=Building A New Biocultural Synthesis |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year= 1998 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=T8ZhpG_B_6MC |isbn= 978-0-472-06606-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II the emphasis began to shift toward an effort to explore the role culture plays in shaping human biology.

=== Evolutionary ===
{{main|Evolutionary anthropology}}
Evolutionary anthropology is the interdisciplinary study of the [[human evolution|evolution]] of [[human physiology]] and [[human behaviour]] and the relation between [[hominins]] and non-hominin [[primate]]s. Evolutionary anthropology is based in [[natural science]] and [[social science]], combining the [[Human development (biology)|human development]] with socioeconomic factors. Evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans, past and present. It is based on a [[scientific]] approach, and brings together fields such as [[archaeology]], [[behavioral ecology]], [[psychology]], [[primatology]], and [[genetics]]. It is a dynamic and [[interdisciplinary]] field, drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience, past and present.

=== Forensic ===
{{main|Forensic anthropology}}
Forensic anthropology  is the application of the science of [[physical anthropology]] and human [[osteology]] in a legal setting, most often in criminal cases where the victim's remains are in the advanced stages of [[decomposition]]. A forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals whose remains are decomposed, burned, mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable. The adjective &quot;forensic&quot; refers to the application of this subfield of science to a court of law.

=== Palaeoanthropology ===
{{main|Palaeoanthropology}}
Paleoanthropology combines the disciplines of [[paleontology]] and [[physical anthropology]]. It is the study of ancient humans, as found in [[fossil]] [[Hominidae|hominid]] evidence such as [[Petrifaction|petrifacted]] bones and footprints.

== Organizations ==
Contemporary anthropology is an established science with academic departments at most universities and colleges. The single largest organization of Anthropologists is the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA), which was founded in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/about/ AAAnet.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Membership is made up of anthropologists from around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/membership/upload/MAY-08-AAA.pdf AAAnet.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, a group of European and American scholars in the field of anthropology established the [[European Association of Social Anthropologists]] (EASA) which serves as a major professional organization for anthropologists working in Europe. The EASA seeks to advance the status of anthropology in Europe and to increase visibility of marginalized anthropological traditions and thereby contribute to the project of a global anthropology or world anthropology.

Hundreds of other organizations exist in the various sub-fields of anthropology, sometimes divided up by nation or region, and many anthropologists work with collaborators in other disciplines, such as [[geology]], [[physics]], [[zoology]], [[paleontology]], [[anatomy]], [[music theory]], [[art history]], [[sociology]] and so on, belonging to professional societies in those disciplines as well.&lt;ref&gt;Johanson, Donald and Kate Wong.

==Controversial ethical stances==
Anthropologists, like other researchers (especially historians and scientists engaged in field research), have over time assisted state policies and projects, especially colonialism.&lt;ref name = &quot;pbuteh&quot;&gt;Asad, Talal, ed. (1973) ''Anthropology &amp; the Colonial Encounter.'' Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van Breman, Jan, and Akitoshi Shimizu (1999) ''Anthropology and Colonialism in Asia and Oceania''. Richmond, Surrey: Curzon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators have contended:

*That the discipline grew out of colonialism, perhaps was in league with it, and derived some of its key notions from it, consciously or not.   (See, for example, Gough, Pels and Salemink, but cf. Lewis 2004).&lt;ref name=Gellner&gt;Gellner, Ernest (1992) ''Postmodernism, Reason, and Religion''. London/New York: Routledge. Pp: 26-29.&lt;/ref&gt;
*That ethnographic work was often [[Ahistoricism|ahistorical]], writing about people as if they were &quot;out of time&quot; in an &quot;ethnographic present&quot; (Johannes Fabian, ''Time and Its Other'').

=== Ethics of cultural relativism ===
At the same time, anthropologists urge, as part of their quest for scientific objectivity, [[cultural relativism]], which has an influence on all the sub-fields of anthropology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ingold1994p331&quot;/&gt; This is the notion that particular cultures should not be judged by one culture's values or viewpoints, but that all cultures should be viewed as relative to each other. There should be no notions, in good anthropology, of one culture being better or worse than another culture.&lt;ref&gt;Levi-Strauss, Claude.  ''The Savage Mind''. 1962; Womack, Mari.  ''Being Human.'' 2001&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2012}}

Ethical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting [[genocide]], [[infanticide]], racism, [[mutilation]] including [[circumcision]] and [[subincision]], and [[torture]]. Topics like racism, slavery or human sacrifice, therefore, attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies &lt;ref&gt;Harris, Marvin. ''Cows, Pigs, Wars, and Witches''.&lt;/ref&gt; to genes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=209831&amp;sectioncode=26 Timeshighereducation.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; to [[acculturation]] have been proposed, not to mention theories of [[colonialism]] and many others as root causes of [[Man's inhumanity to man]]. To illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach, one can take just one of these topics, such as &quot;racism&quot; and find thousands of anthropological references, stretching across all the major and minor sub-fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement on &quot;Race&quot;|url=http://www.aaanet.org/stmts/racepp.htm|publisher=American Anthropological Association|date=May 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/282/5389/654?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;titleabstract=DNA+challenges+race&amp;searchid=QID_NOT_SET&amp;FIRSTINDEX=; Sciencemag.org], Shanklin, Eugenia. 1994.

===Ethical stance to military involvement===
Anthropologists' involvement with the U.S. government, in particular, has caused bitter controversy within the discipline. Franz Boas publicly objected to US participation in World War I, and after the war he published a brief expose and condemnation of the participation of several American archaeologists in espionage in Mexico under their cover as scientists.

But by the 1940s, many of Boas' anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war effort against the &quot;Axis&quot; (Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan). Many served in the armed forces, while others worked in intelligence (for example, [[Office of Strategic Services]] and the [[Office of War Information]]). At the same time, David H. Price's work on American anthropology during the Cold War provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies.

Attempts to accuse anthropologists of complicity with the CIA and government intelligence activities during the Vietnam War years have turned up surprisingly little (although anthropologist Hugo Nutini was active in the stillborn [[Project Camelot]]).&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, Lewis ed.(1967) The Rise and Fall of Project Camelot.&lt;/ref&gt; Many anthropologists (students and teachers) were active in the antiwar movement.  Numerous resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly at the annual meetings of the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA).

Professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the [[State (polity)|state]]. Their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings. The Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and Commonwealth (ASA) has called certain scholarship ethically dangerous. The AAA's current 'Statement of Professional Responsibility' clearly states that &quot;in relation with their own government and with host governments&amp;nbsp;... no secret research, no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given.&quot;

Anthropologists, along with other social scientists, are working with the US military as part of the US Army's strategy in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0907/p01s08-wosc.htm Christian Science Monitor]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Christian Science Monitor]] reports that &quot;Counterinsurgency efforts focus on better grasping and meeting local needs&quot; [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|in Afghanistan]], under the ''[[Human Terrain System]]'' (HTS) program; in addition, HTS teams are working with the [[US military in Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Human Terrain System: A CORDS for the 21st Century|url=http://www.army.mil/professionalWriting/volumes/volume4/december_2006/12_06_2.html|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20140121225645/http://www.army.mil/professionalWriting/volumes/volume4/december_2006/12_06_2.html|archivedate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the American Anthropological Association's Commission on the Engagement of Anthropology with the US Security and Intelligence Communities released its final report concluding, in part, that, &quot;When ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions, not subject to external review, where data collection occurs in the context of war, integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency, and in a potentially coercive environment – all characteristic factors of the HTS concept and its application – it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology. In summary, while we stress that constructive engagement between anthropology and the military is possible, CEAUSSIC suggests that the AAA emphasize the incompatibility of HTS with disciplinary ethics and practice for job seekers and that it further recognize the problem of allowing HTS to define the meaning of &quot;anthropology&quot; within DoD.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.aaanet.org/2009/12/08/aaa-commission-releases-final-report-on-army-human-terrain-system/ AAA Commission Releases Final Report on Army Human Terrain System « American Anthropological Association&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post–World War II developments==
Before WWII British 'social anthropology' and American 'cultural anthropology' were still distinct traditions. After the war, enough British and American anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from one another that some began to speak of them collectively as 'sociocultural' anthropology.

===Basic trends===
There are several characteristics that tend to unite anthropological work. One of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide a comparatively more [[Holism|holistic]] account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hylland Eriksen 2004 p. 79&quot;/&gt; The quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a particular place, problem or phenomenon in detail, using a variety of methods, over a more extensive period than normal in many parts of academia.

In the 1990s and 2000s (decade), calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard. These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.&lt;ref&gt;Rosaldo, Renato.  ''Culture and Truth: The remaking of social analysis''. Beacon Press. 1993; Inda, John Xavier and Renato Rosaldo.  ''The Anthropology of Globalization. Wiley-Blackwell. 2007''&lt;/ref&gt;

Biological anthropologists are interested in both human variation&lt;ref&gt;Robert Jurmain, Lynn Kilgore, Wenda Trevathan, and Russell L. Ciochon.  ''Introduction to Physical Anthropology. 11th Edition. Wadsworth. 2007, chapters I, III and IV.''; Wompack, Mari.  ''Being Human''. Prentice Hall. 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;11–20.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the possibility of human universals (behaviors, ideas or concepts shared by virtually all human cultures).&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Donald.  ''Human Universals''. McGraw Hill. 1991; Roughley, Neil.  ''Being Humans: Anthropological Universality and Particularity in Transciplinary Perspectives''. Walter de Gruyter Publishing. 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  They use many different methods of study, but modern population [[genetics]], [[participant observation]] and other techniques often take anthropologists &quot;into the field,&quot; which means traveling to a community in its own setting, to do something called &quot;fieldwork.&quot;  On the biological or physical side, human measurements, genetic samples, nutritional data may be gathered and published as articles or monographs.

Along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis, anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions. Human time on Earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material, such as the [[Paleolithic]] and the [[Neolithic]], of particular use in archaeology.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Further cultural subdivisions according to tool types, such as [[Olduwan]] or [[Mousterian]] or [[Levallois technique|Levalloisian]] help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Anthropologists and geographers share approaches to [[Culture regions]] as well, since mapping cultures is central to both sciences. By making comparisons across cultural traditions (time-based) and cultural regions (space-based), anthropologists have developed various kinds of [[comparative method]], a central part of their science.

===Commonalities between fields===
Because anthropology developed from so many different enterprises (see [[History of Anthropology]]), including but not limited to [[Fossil collecting|fossil-hunting]], [[Exploration|exploring]], documentary film-making, [[paleontology]], [[primatology]], antiquity dealings and curatorship, [[philology]], [[etymology]], [[genetics]], regional analysis, [[ethnology]], history, [[philosophy]], and [[religious studies]],&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, Paul A. and Liam D. Murphy. ''A History of Anthropological Theory''. Broadview Press. 2003. p.&amp;nbsp;11–12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Stocking, &quot;Paradigmatic Traditions in the History of Anthropology.&quot; In George Stocking, The Ethnographer's Magic and Other Essays in the History of Anthropology (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1992):342-361.&lt;/ref&gt; it is difficult to characterize the entire field in a brief article, although attempts to write histories of the entire field have been made.&lt;ref&gt;Leaf, Murray. ''Man, Mind and Science: A History of Anthropology.'' Columbia University Press. 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of &quot;other cultures&quot;, both in terms of time (past societies) and space (non-European/non-Western societies).&lt;ref&gt;See the many essays relating to this in Prem Poddar and David Johnson, Historical Companion to Postcolonial Thought in English, Edinburgh University Press, 2004. See also Prem Poddar et al., Historical Companion to Postcolonial Literatures--Continental Europe and its Empires, Edinburgh University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the classic of [[urban anthropology]], [[Ulf Hannerz]] in the introduction to his seminal ''Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology'' mentions that the &quot;[[Third World]]&quot; had habitually received most of attention; anthropologists who traditionally specialized in &quot;other cultures&quot; looked for them far away and started to look &quot;across the tracks&quot; only in late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ulf Hannerz]] (1980) &quot;Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology&quot;, ISBN 0-231-08376-9, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Now there exist many works focusing on peoples and topics very close to the author's &quot;home&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;&gt;Lewis, Herbert S. (1998) ''[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-7294(199809)2%3A100%3A3%3C716%3ATMOAAI%3E2.0.CO%3B2-3 The Misrepresentation of Anthropology and its Consequences]'' ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' &quot;100:&quot; 716-731&lt;/ref&gt; It is also argued that other fields of study, like History and [[Sociology]], on the contrary focus disproportionately on the West.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody]] (2007) ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=jo1UVi48KywC The Theft of History]'' Cambridge University Press ISBN 0-521-87069-0&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the study of Western societies has been traditionally left to [[sociologist]]s, but this is increasingly changing,&lt;ref&gt;*{{Cite journal | last1 = Abélès | first1 = Marc | year = | title = How the Anthropology of France Has Changed Anthropology in France: Assessing New Directions in the Field | journal = [[Cultural Anthropology]] | volume = 1999 | issue = | page = 407 | jstor = 08867356 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; starting in the 1970s from scholars like Isac Chiva and journals like ''[[Terrain (journal)|Terrain]]'' (&quot;fieldwork&quot;), and developing with the center founded by [[Marc Augé]] (''[[École des hautes études en sciences sociales|Le Centre d'anthropologie des mondes contemporains]]'', the Anthropological Research Center of Contemporary Societies).

Since the 1980s it has become common for social and cultural anthropologists to set ethnographic research in the North Atlantic region, frequently examining the connections between locations rather than limiting research to a single locale. There has also been a related shift toward broadening the focus beyond the daily life of ordinary people; increasingly, research is set in settings such as scientific laboratories, social movements, governmental and nongovernmental organizations and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Michael M. J. ''Emergent Forms of Life and the Anthropological Voice''. Duke University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Agriculture}}
'''Agricultural science''' is a broad multidisciplinary field that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic and [[social sciences]] that are used in the practice and understanding of agriculture. ([[veterinary medicine|Veterinary science]], but not [[animal science]], is often excluded from the definition.)

==Agriculture and agricultural science==

The two terms are often confused. However, they cover different concepts:
*Agriculture is the set of activities that transform the environment for the production of animals and plants for human use. Agriculture concerns techniques, including the application of agronomic research.
*[[Agronomy]] is [[research and development]] related to studying and improving plant-based agriculture.

Agricultural sciences include research and development on:
* Production techniques (e.g., [[irrigation]] management, recommended [[nitrogen]] inputs)
* Improving [[agricultural productivity]] in terms of quantity and quality (e.g., selection of [[drought]]-resistant crops and animals, development of new [[pesticide]]s, yield-sensing technologies, simulation models of crop growth, in-vitro [[cell culture]] techniques)
* Minimizing the effects of pests ([[weeds]], [[insects]], [[pathogens]], [[nematodes]]) on crop or animal production systems.
* Transformation of primary products into end-consumer products (e.g., production, preservation, and packaging of [[dairy product]]s)
* Prevention and correction of adverse environmental effects (e.g., [[soils retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]], [[waste management]], [[bioremediation]])
* [[Theoretical production ecology]], relating to crop production modeling
* Traditional agricultural systems, sometimes termed [[subsistence agriculture]], which feed most of the poorest people in the world.  These systems are of interest as they sometimes retain a level of integration with natural ecological systems greater than that of [[industrial agriculture]], which may be more sustainable than some modern agricultural systems.
* Food production and demand on a global basis, with special attention paid to the major producers, such as China, India, Brazil, the USA and the EU.

== Fertilizer ==
One of the most common yield reducers is because of fertilizer not being applied in slightly higher quantities during transition period, the time it takes the soil to rebuild its aggregates and organic matter.  Yields will decrease temporarily because of nitrogen being immobilized in the crop residue, which can take a few months to several years to decompose, depending on the crop's C to N ratio and the local environment

==Agricultural science: a local science==

With the exception of [[theoretical production ecology|theoretical agronomy]], research in agronomy, more than in any other field, is strongly related to local areas. It can be considered a science of [[ecoregions]], because it is closely linked to soil properties and [[climate]], which are never exactly the same from one place to another. Many people think an agricultural production system relying on local weather, [[soil]] characteristics, and specific crops has to be studied locally. Others feel a need to know and understand production systems in as many areas as possible, and the human dimension of interaction with nature.

==History of agricultural science==
{{Main|History of agricultural science}}

Agricultural science began with [[Gregor Mendel]]'s genetic work, but in modern terms might be better dated from the [[chemical fertilizer]] outputs of [[plant physiology|plant physiological]] understanding in 18th-century Germany.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} In the United States, a scientific revolution in agriculture began with the [[Hatch Act of 1887|Hatch Act]] of 1887, which used the term &quot;agricultural science&quot;. The Hatch Act was driven by farmers' interest in knowing the constituents of early artificial fertilizer. The [[Smith-Hughes Act]] of 1917 shifted agricultural education back to its vocational roots, but the scientific foundation had been built.&lt;ref&gt;Hillison J. (1996). [http://pubs.aged.tamu.edu/jae/pdf/vol37/37-04-08.pdf The Origins of Agriscience: Or Where Did All That Scientific Agriculture Come From?]. ''Journal of Agricultural Education''.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1906, public expenditures on agricultural research in the US exceeded private expenditures for the next 44 years.&lt;ref name=ScienceForAg&gt;Huffman WE, Evenson RE. (2006). ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=ZWcolrGftT0C Science for Agriculture]''. [[Blackwell Publishing]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xxi}}

Intensification of agriculture since the 1960s in developed and [[developing countries]], often referred to as the [[Green Revolution]], was closely tied to progress made in  selecting and improving crops and animals for high productivity, as well as to developing additional inputs such as artificial [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide|phytosanitary product]]s.

As the oldest and largest human intervention in nature, the environmental impact  of agriculture in general and more recently [[intensive agriculture]], industrial development, and population growth have raised many questions among agricultural scientists and have led to the development and emergence of new fields. These include technological fields  that assume the solution to technological problems lies in better technology, such as [[integrated pest management]], [[waste management|waste treatment]] technologies, [[landscape architecture]], [[genomics]], and [[agricultural philosophy]] fields that include references to [[food industry|food production]] as something essentially different from non-essential economic 'goods'. In fact, the interaction between these two approaches provide a fertile field for deeper understanding in agricultural science.

New technologies, such as [[biotechnology]] and [[computer science]] (for data processing and storage), and technological advances have made it possible to develop new research fields, including [[genetic engineering]], [[agrophysics]], improved [[statistics|statistical analysis]], and [[precision farming]]. Balancing these, as above, are the natural and human sciences of agricultural science that seek to understand the human-nature interactions of [[history of agriculture|traditional agriculture]], including interaction of [[Religion and Agriculture|religion and agriculture]], and the non-material components of agricultural production systems.

==Agricultural science and agriculture crisis==
Agriculture sciences seek to feed the world's population while preventing [[biosafety]] problems that may affect human health and the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. This requires promoting good management of [[natural resources]] and respect for the environment, and increasingly concern for the psychological wellbeing of all concerned in the food production and consumption system.

Economic, environmental, and social aspects of agriculture sciences are subjects of ongoing debate. Recent crises (such as avian influenza, [[Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy|mad cow disease]] and issues such as the use of [[genetically modified organism]]s) illustrate the complexity and importance of this debate.

[[File:Fotothek df tg 0006097 Theosophie ^ Alchemie.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Emerald Tablet]], a key text of Western Alchemy, in a 17th-century edition]]

'''Alchemy''' is an influential philosophical tradition whose practitioners have, from antiquity, claimed it to be the precursor to profound powers. The defining objectives of alchemy are varied, but historically have typically included one or more of the following goals: the creation of the fabled [[philosopher's stone]]; the ability to transform [[base metal]]s into the [[noble metal]]s (gold or silver); and development of an [[elixir of life]], which would confer youth and longevity.

Alchemy differs significantly from modern science in its inclusion of [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] principles and practices related to [[mythology]], [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[religion]], and [[spirituality]]. It is recognized as a [[protoscience]] that contributed to the development of modern [[chemistry]] and [[medicine]]. Alchemists developed a structure of basic laboratory techniques, theory, terminology, and experimental method, some of which are still in use today.

==Overview==
The ostensible goals of alchemy are often given as the [[wiktionary:transmutation|transmutation]] of common metals into gold (known as [[chrysopoeia]]), the creation of a [[panacea (medicine)|panacea]], and the discovery of a [[Alkahest|universal solvent]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/alchemy Alchemy at Dictionary.com].&lt;/ref&gt; However, these only highlight certain aspects of alchemy. [[List of alchemists|Alchemist]]s have historically rewritten and evolved their explanation of alchemy, so that it is difficult to define it simply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Linden|1996|pp=7,11}}&lt;/ref&gt; H.J. Sheppard gives the following as a comprehensive summary:

{{quotation|Alchemy is the art of liberating parts of the Cosmos from temporal existence and achieving perfection which, for metals is gold, and for man, longevity, then immortality and, finally, redemption. Material perfection was sought through the action of a preparation (Philosopher's Stone for metals; Elixir of Life for humans), while spiritual ennoblement resulted from some form of inner revelation or other enlightenment (Gnosis, for example, in Hellenistic and western practices).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Linden|1996|pp=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Modern discussions of alchemy are generally split into an examination of its [[exoteric]] practical applications and its [[esoteric]] aspects. The former is pursued by historians of the physical sciences who have examined the subject in terms of protochemistry, medicine, and [[charlatanism]]. The latter interests psychologists, spiritual and new age communities, hermetic philosophers, and historians of esotericism.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed look into the problems of defining alchemy, see {{Harvnb|Linden|1996|pp=6–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The subject has also made an ongoing impact on literature and the arts. Despite the modern split, numerous sources stress an integration of esoteric and exoteric approaches to alchemy. Holmyard, when writing on exoteric aspects, states that they cannot be properly appreciated if the esoteric is not always kept in mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holmyard|1957|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prototype for this model can be found in [[Bolus of Mendes|Bolos of Mendes]]' 3rd-century BCE work, ''Physika kai Mystika'' (&quot;On Physical and Mystical Matters&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Antoine Faivre 1995. p.96&quot;/&gt; [[Marie-Louise von Franz]] tells us the double approach of Western alchemy was set from the start, when Greek philosophy was mixed with Egyptian and Mesopotamian technology. The technological, operative approach, which she calls [[extravert]]ed, and the mystic, contemplative, psychological one, which she calls [[introvert]]ed are not mutually exclusive, but complementary instead, as meditation requires practice in the real world, and conversely.&lt;ref name=&quot;FRAALC97&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|von Franz|1997|p={{page needed|date=December 2011}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relation to the science of chemistry===
{{Main|History of chemistry}}
[[File:Alchemists Workshop detail from Title Page AQ24 (3).tif|thumb|left|425px|Scientific apparatus in the alchemist's workshop, 1580]]

Practical applications of alchemy produced a wide range of contributions to medicine and the physical sciences. The alchemist [[Robert Boyle]]&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Greenburg. ''From alchemy to chemistry in picture and story.''&lt;/ref&gt; is credited as being the father of chemistry. Paracelsian [[iatrochemistry]] emphasized the medicinal application of alchemy (continued in plant alchemy, or [[spagyric]]).&lt;ref&gt;H. Stanley Redgrove. ''Alchemy Ancient and Modern''  p.60&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of alchemy also influenced [[Isaac Newton|Isaac Newton's]] theory of gravity.&lt;ref&gt;Mitch Stokes. ''Isaac Newton'' p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;  Academic historical research supports that the alchemists were searching for a material substance using physical methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|pp=397–8,400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a popular belief that alchemists made contributions to the &quot;chemical&quot; industries of the day—ore testing and refining, metalworking, production of gunpowder, ink, dyes, paints, cosmetics, [[Tanning|leather tanning]], ceramics, glass manufacture, preparation of extracts, liquors, and so on (it seems that the preparation of ''[[aqua vitae]]'', the &quot;water of life&quot;, was a fairly popular &quot;experiment&quot; among European alchemists). Alchemists contributed [[distillation]] to Western Europe. The attempts of alchemists to arrange information on substances, so as to clarify and anticipate the products of their chemical reactions, resulted in early conceptions of chemical elements and the first rudimentary [[periodic table]]s. They learned how to extract metals from ores, and how to compose many types of inorganic acids and bases.

During the 17th century, practical alchemy started to disappear in favor of its younger offshoot chemistry,&lt;ref name=&quot;William R Newman 1998 pp. 32–65&quot;&gt;William R Newman &amp; Lawrence M Principe (1998) &quot;The Etymological Origins of an Historiographic Mistake&quot; in ''Early Science and Medicine'', Vol. 3, No. 1 pp. 32–65&lt;/ref&gt; as it was renamed by [[Robert Boyle]], the &quot;father of modern chemistry&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deem, Rich 2005&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Deem, Rich |title=The Religious Affiliation of Robert Boyle the father of modern chemistry. From: Famous Scientists Who Believed in God |year=2005 |publisher=adherents.com |url=http://www.adherents.com/people/pb/Robert_Boyle.html |accessdate=17 April 2009 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090326003343/http://www.adherents.com/people/pb/Robert_Boyle.html| archivedate= 26 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''The Skeptical Chymist'', Boyle attacked [[Paracelsus]] and the [[natural philosophy]] of [[Aristotle]], which was taught at universities. However, Boyle's biographers, in their emphasis that he laid the foundations of modern chemistry, neglect how steadily he clung to the [[Scholasticism|scholastic sciences]] and to alchemy, in theory, practice and doctrine.&lt;ref name=&quot;More 61–76&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/2707281 | last = More | first = Louis Trenchard | title = Boyle as Alchemist | journal = Journal of the History of Ideas | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 61–76 | publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press | date = January 1941 | accessdate = 30 March 2010 | jstor = 2707281 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decline of alchemy continued in the 18th century with the birth of modern chemistry, which provided a more precise and reliable framework within a new view of the universe based on rational [[materialism]].

===Relation to Hermeticism===
In the eyes of a variety of esoteric and [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] practitioners, the heart of alchemy is spiritual. Transmutation of lead into gold is presented as an analogy for personal transmutation, purification, and perfection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Antoine Faivre 1995. p.96&quot;&gt;Antoine Faivre, Wouter J. Hanegraaff. ''Western esotericism and the science of religion.'' 1995. p.96&lt;/ref&gt;  This approach is often termed 'spiritual', 'esoteric', or 'internal' alchemy.

Early alchemists, such as [[Zosimos of Panopolis]] (c. AD 300), highlight the spiritual nature of the alchemical quest, symbolic of a religious regeneration of the human soul.&lt;ref&gt;Allen G. Debus. ''Alchemy and early modern chemistry.'' The Society for the History of Alchemy and Chemistry. p.34.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach continued in the Middle Ages, as metaphysical aspects, substances, physical states, and material processes were used as metaphors for [[spirit|spiritual entities]], spiritual states, and, ultimately, transformation. In this sense, the literal meanings of 'Alchemical Formulas' were a blind, hiding their true [[spiritual philosophy]]. Practitioners and patrons such as [[Melchior Cibinensis]] and [[Pope Innocent VIII]] existed within the ranks of the church, while [[Martin Luther]] applauded alchemy for its consistency with Christian teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Raphael Patai. ''The Jewish Alchemists: A History and Source Book.'' Princeton University Press. p.4&lt;/ref&gt; Both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea symbolized evolution from an imperfect, diseased, corruptible, and ephemeral state towards a perfect, healthy, incorruptible, and everlasting state; and the philosopher's stone then represented a mystic key that would make this evolution possible. Applied to the alchemist himself, the twin goal symbolized his evolution from ignorance to enlightenment, and the stone represented a hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal. In texts that are written according to this view, the cryptic [[alchemical symbol]]s, diagrams, and textual imagery of late alchemical works typically contain multiple layers of meanings, allegories, and references to other equally cryptic works; and must be laboriously decoded to discover their true meaning.

In his 1766 ''Alchemical Catechism'', Théodore Henri de Tschudi denotes that the usage of the metals was a symbol:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Q. When the Philosophers speak of gold and silver, from which they extract their matter, are we to suppose that they refer to the vulgar gold and silver? 
A. By no means; vulgar silver and gold are dead, while those of the Philosophers are full of life.&lt;ref&gt;Théodore Henri de Tschudi. Hermetic Catechism in his ''L'Etoile Flamboyant ou la Société des Franc-Maçons considerée sous tous les aspects.'' 1766.  (A.E. Waite translation as found in ''The Hermetic and Alchemical Writings of Paracelsus.'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

During the renaissance, alchemy broke into more distinct schools placing spiritual alchemists in high contrast with those working with literal metals and chemicals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raphael Patai p.3&quot;&gt;Raphael Patai. ''The Jewish Alchemists: A History and Source Book.'' Princeton University Press. p.3&lt;/ref&gt; While most spiritual alchemists also incorporate elements of exotericism, examples of a purely spiritual alchemy can be traced back as far as the 16th century, when [[Jacob Boehme]] used alchemical terminology in strictly mystical writings.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Merkur. ''Gnosis: an esoteric tradition of mystical visions and unions.'' State University of New York Press. p.75&lt;/ref&gt;  Another example can be found in the work of [[Heinrich Khunrath]] (1560–1605) who viewed the process of transmutation as occurring within the alchemist's soul.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raphael Patai p.3&quot;/&gt;

The recent work of L. M. Principe and [[William R. Newman]], seeks to reject the 'spiritual interpretation' of alchemy, especially as applied to medieval, 16th- and 17th-century alchemy, stating it arose as a product of the Victorian occult revival.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewmanPrincipe2002p37&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Newman|Principe|2002|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence to support that some classical alchemical sources were adulterated during this time to give greater weight to the spiritual aspects of alchemy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newtonianism' p211&quot;&gt;''Newton and Newtonianism'' by James E. Force, Sarah Hutton, '''p211'''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Principe 2001 395–6&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|pp=395–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite this, other scholars such as Calian and Tilton reject this view as entirely historically inaccurate, drawing examples of historical spiritual alchemy from Boehme, Isaac Newton, and [[Michael Maier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Calian|2010|p={{page needed|date=December 2011}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{Main|Chemistry (etymology)}}
The word alchemy may derive from the [[Old French]] ''alquimie'', which is from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''alchimia'', and which is in turn from the [[Arabic]] ''al-kimia'' ({{rtl-lang|ar|الكيمياء}}). This term itself is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''chemeia'' (χημεία) or ''chemia'' (χημία)&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0017630#DWS-M_EN_GB-037342 alchemy], Oxford Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt; with the addition of the Arabic [[definite article]] ''[[al-]]''  ({{rtl-lang|ar|الـ}}).&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{OED|alchemy}} Or see {{OEtymD|alchemy|accessdate=07 April 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greek word may have been derived from&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the etymology for χημεία in {{Cite book| edition = Eighth edition, revised throughout| publisher = Clarendon Press| last = Liddell| first = Henry George|author2=Robert Scott| title = A Greek-English Lexicon| location = Oxford| year = 1901| isbn = 0-19-910205-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; a version of the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] name for Egypt, which was itself based on the Ancient Egyptian word ''kēme'' (hieroglyphic Khmi, ''black earth'', as opposed to desert sand).&lt;ref name=OED/&gt;

The word could also have originally derived from the Greek ''chumeia'' (χυμεία) meaning &quot;mixture&quot; and referring to [[pharmaceutical chemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, both the etymology given in the Oxford English Dictionary and also that for χυμεία in {{Cite book| edition = A new edition, revised and augmented throughout| publisher = Clarendon Press| last = Liddell| first = Henry George| coauthors = Robert Scott, Henry Stuart Jones| title = A Greek-English Lexicon| location = Oxford| year = 1940|url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=xumeia&amp;la=greek#lexicon| isbn = 0-19-910205-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the later rise of alchemy in Alexandria, the word may have derived from Χημία, and thus became spelled as χημεία, and the original meaning forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;The original source for this analysis is the article on pp.&amp;nbsp;81&amp;ndash;85 of {{Cite book| publisher = F. Duemmler| last = Mahn| first = Carl August Friedrich| title = Etymologische untersuchungen auf dem gebiete der romanischen sprachen| year = 1855| url = http://books.google.com/?id=-BMLAAAAQAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its etymology is still open to question.

==History==
[[File:Alchemy of Happiness.png|thumb|[[Kimiya-yi sa'ādat]] (''The Alchemy of Happiness'') &amp;ndash; a text on Islamic philosophy and spiritual alchemy by [[Al-Ghazali|Al-Ghazālī]] (1058–1111).]]

Alchemy covers several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents. These traditions' general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and &quot;genetic&quot; relationships. One can distinguish at least three major strands, which appear to be largely independent, at least in their earlier stages: [[Chinese alchemy]], centered in China and its zone of cultural influence; [[Rasayana|Indian alchemy]], centered around the [[Indian subcontinent]]; and Western alchemy, which occurred around the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] and whose center has shifted over the millennia from [[Egypt (Roman province)|Greco-Roman Egypt]], to the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]], and finally [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]]. Chinese alchemy was closely connected to [[Taoism]] and Indian alchemy with the [[Indian religions|Dharmic faiths]], whereas Western alchemy developed its own philosophical system that was largely independent of, but influenced by, various [[Western religion]]s. It is still an open question whether these three strands share a common origin, or to what extent they influenced each other.

===Alchemy in Greco-Roman Egypt===

[[File:Zosimosapparat.jpg|thumb|left|300px| Ambix, cucurbit and retort of Zosimos, from [[Marcelin Berthelot]], ''Collection des anciens alchimistes grecs'' (3 vol., Paris, 1887–1888)]]

The start of European alchemy may generally be traced to [[Hellenistic Egypt]]. The [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] city of [[Alexandria]] was a center of Greek alchemical knowledge, and retained its preeminence through most of the Greek and Roman periods.&lt;ref&gt;''New Scientist'', 24–31 December 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Here, elements of technology, religion, mythology, and [[Greeks|Greek]] philosophy, each with their own much longer histories, combined to form the earliest known records of alchemy in the West. [[Zosimos of Panopolis]] wrote the oldest known books on alchemy {{citation needed|date=February 2013}} while [[Mary the Jewess]] is credited as being the first non-fictitious Western alchemist. They wrote in Greek and lived in Egypt under Roman rule.

'''Mythology''' – Zosimos of Panopolis claimed that alchemy dated back to pharaonic Egypt where it was the domain of the priestly class; there is little or no evidence for such a claim though.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garfinkel|first=Harold|title=Ethnomethodological Studies of Work|publisher=Routledge &amp;Kegan Paul|year=1986|pages=127|isbn=0-415-11965-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alchemical writers used Classical figures from Greek, Roman, and Egyptian mythology to illuminate their works and allegorize alchemical transmutation.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Bonnefoy. 'Roman and European Mythologies'. University of Chicago Press, 1992. pp. 211–213&lt;/ref&gt;  These included the pantheon of gods related to the Classical planets, [[Isis]], [[Osiris]], [[Jason]], and many others.

The central figure in the mythology of alchemy is [[Hermes Trismegistus]] (or Thrice-Great Hermes). His name is derived from the [[deity|god]] [[Thoth]] and his Greek counterpart [[Hermes]]. Hermes and his [[caduceus]] or serpent-staff, were among alchemy's principal symbols. According to [[Clement of Alexandria]], he wrote what were called the &quot;forty-two books of Hermes&quot;, covering all fields of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume II/CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA/The Stromata, or Miscellanies/Book VI/Chapter IV.|Clement, ''Stromata'', vi. 4.]]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Hermetica]]'' of Thrice-Great Hermes is generally understood to form the basis for Western alchemical philosophy and practice, called the [[hermeticism|hermetic philosophy]] by its early practitioners. These writings were collected in the first centuries of the common era.

'''Technology''' – The dawn of Western alchemy is sometimes associated with that of [[metallurgy]], extending back to 3500 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Linden|1996|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many writings were lost when the [[Roman Emperor|emperor]] [[Diocletian]] ordered the burning of alchemical books&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Partington|first=James Riddick|title=A Short History of Chemistry|year=1989|pages=20|isbn=0-486-65977-1|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; after suppressing a revolt in Alexandria (292 CE). Few original Egyptian documents on alchemy have survived, most notable among them the [[Stockholm papyrus]] and the [[Leyden papyrus X]]. Dating from 300 to 500 CE, they contained recipes for dyeing and making artificial gemstones, cleaning and fabricating pearls, and the manufacture of imitation gold and silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Linden|2003|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; These writings lack the mystical, philosophical elements of alchemy, but do contain the works of [[Bolus of Mendes]] (or [[Pseudo-Democritus]]) which aligned these recipes with theoretical knowledge of astrology and the [[Classical elements]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chemistry, Bensaude-Vincent 1996, p13&quot;&gt;''A History of Chemistry'', Bensaude-Vincent, Isabelle Stengers, ''Harvard University Press'', 1996, '''p13'''&lt;/ref&gt; Between the time of Bolus and Zosimos, the change took place that transformed this metallurgy into a Hermetic art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Linden|1996|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philosophy''' – Alexandria acted as a melting pot for philosophies of [[Pythagoreanism]], [[Platonism]], [[Stoicism]] and [[Gnosticism]] which formed the origin of alchemy's character.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chemistry, Bensaude-Vincent 1996, p13&quot;/&gt; An important example of alchemy's roots in Greek philosophy, originated by [[Empedocles]] and developed by Aristotle, was that all things in the universe were formed from only four elements: [[Earth (classical element)|earth]], [[Air (classical element)|air]], [[Water (classical element)|water]], and [[Fire (classical element)|fire]]. According to Aristotle, each element had a sphere to which it belonged and to which it would return if left undisturbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Lindsay, Jack | title=The Origins of Alchemy in Graeco-Roman Egypt | location=London | publisher=Muller | year=1970 | isbn= 0-389-01006-5 | page=16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The four elements of the Greek were mostly qualitative aspects of matter, not quantitative, as our modern elements are. &quot;...True alchemy never regarded earth, air, water, and fire as corporeal or chemical substances in the present-day sense of the word. The four elements are simply the primary, and most general, qualities by means of which the amorphous and purely quantitative substance of all bodies first reveals itself in differentiated form.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Titus | last=Burckhardt | authorlink=Titus Burckhardt | title=Alchemy: Science of the Cosmos, Science of the Soul | location=Baltimore | publisher=Penguin | year=1967 | page=66 | others=Trans. William Stoddart | isbn=0-906540-96-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later alchemists extensively developed the mystical aspects of this concept.
Alchemy coexisted alongside emerging Christianity.  [[Lactantius]] believed Hermes Trismegistus had prophesied its birth.   [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] (354–430 CE) later affirmed this, but also condemned Trismegistus for idolatry.&lt;ref&gt;Fanning, Philip Ashley. ''Isaac Newton and the Transmutation of Alchemy: An Alternative View of the Scientific Revolution.'' 2009. p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of Pagan, Christian, and Jewish alchemists can be found during this period.

Most of the Greco-Roman alchemists preceding Zosimos are known only by pseudonyms, such as Moses, Isis, Cleopatra, Democritus, and [[Ostanes]]. Others authors such as Komarios, and Chymes, we only know through fragments of text. After 400 CE, Greek alchemical writers occupied themselves solely in commenting on the works of these predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;F. Sherwood Taylor. ''Alchemists, Founders of Modern Chemistry.'' p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; By the middle of the 7th century alchemy was almost an entirely mystical discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Allen G. Debus. ''Alchemy and early modern chemistry: papers from Ambix.'' p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; It was at that time that [[Khalid Ibn Yazid]] sparked its migration from Alexandria to the Islamic world, facilitating the translation and preservation of Greek alchemical texts in the 8th and 9th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Glen Warren Bowersock, Peter Robert Lamont Brown, Oleg Grabar. ''Late antiquity: a guide to the postclassical world.'' p. 284–285&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[The fall of the roman empire|the fall of the Roman Empire]], the focus of alchemical development moved to the Islamic World. Much more is known about [[Islam]]ic alchemy because it was better documented: indeed, most of the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as Arabic translations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Titus | last=Burckhardt | authorlink=Titus Burckhardt | title=Alchemy: Science of the Cosmos, Science of the Soul | location=Baltimore | publisher=Penguin | year=1967 | page=46 | others=Trans. William Stoddart | isbn=0-906540-96-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''alchemy'' itself was derived from the Arabic word الكيمياء ''al-kimia''. The Islamic world was a melting pot for alchemy. [[Plato]]nic and [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] thought, which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science, continued to be assimilated during the late 7th and early 8th centuries.

In the late 8th century, [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] (known as &quot;Geber&quot; in Europe) introduced a new approach to alchemy, based on [[scientific method]]ology and controlled [[experiment]]ation in the [[laboratory]], in contrast to the ancient Greek and Egyptian alchemists whose works were often allegorical and unintelligible, with very little concern for laboratory work.&lt;ref name=Kraus/&gt; Jabir is thus &quot;considered by many to be the father of [[chemistry]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Zygmunt S.|last=Derewenda|year=2007|title=On wine, chirality and crystallography|journal=Acta Crystallographica Section A: Foundations of Crystallography|volume=64|pages=246–258 [247]|doi=10.1107/S0108767307054293|pmid=18156689|bibcode = 2008AcCrA..64..246D }}&lt;/ref&gt; albeit others reserve that title for [[Robert Boyle]] or [[Antoine Lavoisier]]. The historian of science, Paul Kraus, wrote:

{{quote|To form an idea of the historical place of Jabir's alchemy and to tackle the problem of its sources, it is advisable to compare it with what remains to us of the alchemical literature in the [[Greek language]]. One knows in which miserable state this literature reached us. Collected by [[Byzantine science|Byzantine scientists]] from the tenth century, the corpus of the Greek alchemists is a cluster of incoherent fragments, going back to all the times since the third century until the end of the Middle Ages.

The efforts of Berthelot and Ruelle to put a little order in this mass of literature led only to poor results, and the later researchers, among them in particular Mrs. Hammer-Jensen, Tannery, Lagercrantz, von Lippmann, Reitzenstein, Ruska, Bidez, Festugiere and others, could make clear only few points of detail ....

The study of the Greek alchemists is not very encouraging. An even surface examination of the Greek texts shows that a very small part only was organized according to true experiments of laboratory: even the supposedly technical writings, in the state where we find them today, are unintelligible nonsense which refuses any interpretation.

It is different with Jabir's alchemy. The relatively clear description of the processes and the alchemical apparati, the methodical classification of the substances, mark an experimental spirit which is extremely far away from the weird and odd esotericism of the Greek texts. The theory on which Jabir supports his operations is one of clearness and of an impressive unity. More than with the other Arab authors, one notes with him a balance between theoretical teaching and practical teaching, between the ''[[Ilm (Arabic)|`ilm]]'' and the ''`amal''. In vain one would seek in the Greek texts a work as systematic as that which is presented, for example, in the ''Book of Seventy''.&lt;ref name=Kraus&gt;Kraus, Paul, Jâbir ibn Hayyân, ''Contribution à l'histoire des idées scientifiques dans l'Islam. I. Le corpus des écrits jâbiriens. II. Jâbir et la science grecque,''. Cairo (1942–1943). Repr. By Fuat Sezgin, (Natural Sciences in Islam. 67–68), Frankfurt. 2002:
(cf. {{cite web|author=[[Ahmad Y Hassan]]|title=A Critical Reassessment of the Geber Problem: Part Three|url=http://www.history-science-technology.com/Geber/Geber%203.htm|accessdate=9 August 2008}})&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jabir himself clearly recognized and proclaimed the importance of experimentation:

{{Quotation|The first essential in chemistry is that thou shouldest perform practical work and conduct experiments,&lt;br /&gt; for he who performs not practical work nor makes experiments will never attain to the least degree of mastery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holmyard|1931|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Early Islamic chemists such as [[Jābir ibn Hayyān|Jabir Ibn Hayyan]] (جابر بن حيان in Arabic, Geberus in Latin; usually rendered in English as Geber), [[Al-Kindi]] (Alkindus) and [[Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi]] (Rasis or Rhazes in Latin) contributed a number of key chemical discoveries, such as the muriatic ([[hydrochloric acid]]), [[sulfuric acid|sulfuric]] and [[nitric acid]]s, and more. The discovery that [[aqua regia]], a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids, could dissolve the noblest metal, gold, was to fuel the imagination of alchemists for the next millennium.

Islamic philosophers also made great contributions to alchemical hermeticism. The most influential author in this regard was arguably Jabir. Jabir's ultimate goal was ''[[Takwin]]'', the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory, up to, and including, human life. He analyzed each Aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of ''hotness'', ''coldness'', ''dryness'', and ''moistness''.&lt;ref name=burckhardt29/&gt; According to Jabir, in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior. For example, lead was externally cold and dry, while gold was hot and moist. Thus, Jabir theorized, by rearranging the qualities of one metal, a different metal would result.&lt;ref name=burckhardt29&gt;{{cite book | first=Titus | last=Burckhardt | authorlink=Titus Burckhardt | title=Alchemy: Science of the Cosmos, Science of the Soul | location=Baltimore | publisher=Penguin | year=1967 | page=29 | others=Trans. William Stoddart | isbn=0-906540-96-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this reasoning, the search for the [[philosopher's stone]] was introduced to Western alchemy. Jabir developed an elaborate [[numerology]] whereby the root letters of a substance's name in Arabic, when treated with various transformations, held correspondences to the element's physical properties.

The elemental system used in medieval alchemy also originated with Jabir. His original system consisted of seven elements, which included the five [[classical element]]s ([[aether (classical element)|aether]], [[Air (classical element)|air]], [[Earth (classical element)|earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|fire]] and [[Water (classical element)|water]]), in addition to two [[chemical element]]s representing the metals: [[Sulfur|sulphur]], 'the stone which burns', which characterized the principle of combustibility, and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties. Shortly thereafter, this evolved into eight elements, with the Arabic concept of the three metallic principles: sulphur giving flammability or combustion, mercury giving volatility and stability, and [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] giving solidity.&lt;ref name=&quot;r8&quot;&gt;Strathern, Paul. (2000), ''Mendeleyev's Dream – the Quest for the Elements'', New York: Berkley Books&lt;/ref&gt; The [[atomic theory]] of [[corpuscularianism]], where all physical bodies possess an inner and outer layer of minute particles or corpuscles, also has its origins in the work of Jabir.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Distilling knowledge: alchemy, chemistry, and the scientific revolution|first=Bruce T.|last=Moran|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|year=2005|isbn=0-674-01495-2|page=146|quote=a corpuscularian tradition in alchemy stemming from the speculations of the medieval author Geber (Jabir ibn Hayyan)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 9th to 14th centuries, alchemical theories faced criticism from a variety of practical Muslim chemists, including [[Al-Kindi|Alkindus]],&lt;ref&gt;Felix Klein-Frank (2001), &quot;Al-Kindi&quot;, in [[Oliver Leaman]] &amp; [[Hossein Nasr]], ''History of Islamic Philosophy'', p. 174.

===Alchemy in Medieval Europe===

[[File:JosephWright-Alchemist-1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|&lt;!--ORIGINAL CAPTION, MAY BE INCORRECT: ''The Alchemist in Search of the Philosophers Stone''. MAY BE ACTUALLY Scheele discovering phosphorus.--&gt; Painting by [[Joseph Wright of Derby]], 1771]]

The introduction of alchemy to Latin Europe occurred on 11 February 1144, with the completion of [[Robert of Chester|Robert of Chester's]] translation of the Arabic ''Book of the Composition of Alchemy''. Although European craftsmen and technicians preexisted, Robert notes in his preface that alchemy was unknown in Latin Europe at the time of his writing. The translation of Arabic texts concerning numerous disciplines including alchemy flourished in 12th-century [[Toledo, Spain]], through contributors like [[Gerard of Cremona]] and [[Adelard of Bath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holmyard|1957|pp=105–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translations of the time included the [[Turba Philosophorum]], and the works of [[Avicenna]] and [[al-Razi]]. These brought with them many new words to the European vocabulary for which there was no previous Latin equivalent. Alcohol, carboy, elixir, and athanor are examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holmyard|1957|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, theologian contemporaries of the translators made strides towards the reconciliation of faith and experimental rationalism, thereby priming Europe for the influx of alchemical thought. [[Anselm of Canterbury|Saint Anselm]] (1033–1109) put forth the opinion that faith and rationalism were compatible and encouraged rationalism in a Christian context.

[[Peter Abelard]] (1079–1142) followed Anselm's work, laying down the foundation for acceptance of Aristotelian thought before the first works of Aristotle had reached the West. And later, [[Robert Grosseteste]] (1170–1253) used Abelard's methods of analysis and added the use of observation, experimentation, and conclusions when conducting scientific investigations. Grosseteste also did much work to reconcile Platonic and Aristotelian thinking.&lt;ref name=hollister294f&gt;{{cite book | author=Hollister, C. Warren | title=Medieval Europe: A Short History | location=Blacklick, Ohio | publisher=McGraw–Hill College | year=1990 | isbn=0-07-557141-2 | edition=6th |pages=294f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through much of the 12th and 13th centuries, alchemical knowledge in Europe remained centered around translations, and new Latin contributions were not made. The efforts of the translators were succeeded by that of the encyclopaedists. [[Albertus Magnus]] and [[Roger Bacon]] are the most notable of these.&lt;ref&gt;John Read. ''From Alchemy to Chemistry.'' 1995 p.90&lt;/ref&gt; Their works explained and summarized the newly imported alchemical knowledge in Aristotelian terms. There is little to suggest that Albertus Magnus (1193–1280), a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]], was himself an alchemist. In his authentic works such as the ''Book of Minerals'', he observed and commented on the operations and theories of alchemical authorities like Hermes and Democritus, and unnamed alchemists of his time. Albertus critically compared these to the writings of Aristotle and Avicenna, where they concerned the transmutation of metals. From the time shortly after his death through to the 15th century, twenty-eight or more alchemical tracts were misattributed to him, a common practice giving rise to his reputation as an accomplished alchemist.&lt;ref&gt;James A. Weisheipl. ''Albertus Magnus and the Sciences: Commemorative Essays.'' PIMS. 1980. p.187-202&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, alchemical texts have been attributed to Albert's student [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274).

Roger Bacon (1214–1294) was an Oxford [[Franciscan]] who studied a wide variety of topics including [[optics]], [[linguistics|languages]] and medicine. After studying the [[Pseudo-Aristotle|Pseudo-Aristotelian]] [[Secretum Secretorum]] around 1247, he dramatically shifted his studies towards a vision of a universal science which included alchemy and astrology. Bacon maintained that Albertus Magnus' ignorance of the fundamentals of alchemy prevented a complete picture of wisdom. While alchemy was not more important to him than any of the other sciences, and he did not produce symbolic allegorical works, Bacon's contributions advanced alchemy's connections to [[soteriology]] and Christian theology. Bacon's writings demonstrated an integration of morality, salvation, alchemy, and the prolongation of life. His correspondence with [[Pope Clement IV]] highlighted this integration, calling attention to the importance of alchemy to the papacy.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Brehm. &quot;Roger Bacon's Place in the History of Alchemy.&quot; ''Ambix.'' Vol. 23, Part I, March 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Greeks before him, Bacon acknowledged the division of alchemy into the practical and theoretical. He noted that the theoretical lay outside the scope of Aristotle, the natural philosophers, and all Latin writers of his time. The practical however, confirmed the theoretical through experiment, and Bacon advocated its uses in natural science and medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holmyard|1957|pp=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after Bacon, the influential work of [[Pseudo-Geber]] (sometimes identified as [[Paul of Taranto]]) appeared. His ''Summa Perfectionis'' remained a staple summary of alchemical practice and theory through the medieval and renaissance periods. It was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside sulphur-mercury theory, and the unusual clarity with which they were described.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holmyard|1957|pp=134–141}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 13th century, alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief. Adepts believed in the macrocosm-microcosm theories of Hermes, that is to say, they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could have an effect on the human body (for example, if one could learn the secret of purifying gold, one could use the technique to purify the [[soul|human soul]]). They believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above, and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded [[jargon]] set with traps to mislead the uninitiated. Finally, the alchemists practiced their art: they actively experimented with chemicals and made [[observation]]s and [[theory|theories]] about how the universe operated. Their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that man's soul was divided within himself after the fall of Adam. By purifying the two parts of man's soul, man could be reunited with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Titus | last=Burckhardt | authorlink=Titus Burckhardt | title=Alchemy: Science of the Cosmos, Science of the Soul | location=Baltimore | publisher=Penguin | year=1967 | page=149 | others=Trans. William Stoddart | isbn=0-906540-96-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 14th century, alchemy became more accessible to Europeans outside the confines of Latin speaking churchmen and scholars. Alchemical discourse shifted from scholarly philosophical debate to an exposed social commentary on the alchemists themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Tara E. Nummedal. ''Alchemy and Authority in the Holy Roman Empire.'' University of Chicago Press, 2007. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dante]], [[Piers the Ploughman]], and [[Chaucer]] all painted unflattering pictures of alchemists as thieves and liars. [[Pope John XXII]]'s 1317 edict, ''Spondent quas non exhibent'' forbade the false promises of transmutation made by pseudo-alchemists.&lt;ref&gt;John Hines, II, R. F. Yeager. ''John Gower, Trilingual Poet: Language, Translation, and Tradition.'' Boydell &amp; Brewer. 2010. p.170&lt;/ref&gt; In 1403, Henry IV of England banned the practice of multiplying metals (Although it was possible to buy a licence to attempt to make gold alchemically, and a number were granted by Henry VI and Edward IV &lt;ref&gt;D. Geoghegan, &quot;A licence of Henry VI to practise Alchemy&quot; Ambix, volume 6, 1957, pages 10-17&lt;/ref&gt;). These critiques and regulations centered more around pseudo-alchemical charlatanism than the actual study of alchemy, which continued with an increasingly Christian tone. The 14th century saw the Christian imagery of death and resurrection employed in the alchemical texts of [[Petrus Bonus]], [[John of Rupescissa]] and in works written in the name of Raymond Lull and Arnold of Villanova.&lt;ref&gt;Leah DeVun. ''From Prophecy, Alchemy, and the End of Time: John of Rupescissa in the late Middle Ages.'' Columbia University Press, 2009. p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicolas Flamel]] is a well known alchemist, but a good example of [[pseudepigraphy]], the practice of giving your works the name of someone else, usually more famous. Though the historical Flamel existed, the writings and legends assigned to him only appeared in 1612.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Linden|2003|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Nicolas Flamel. Des Livres et de l'or&quot; by Nigel Wilkins&lt;/ref&gt;
Flamel was not a religious scholar as were many of his predecessors, and his entire interest in the subject revolved around the pursuit of the [[philosopher's stone]]. His work spends a great deal of time describing the processes and reactions, but never actually gives the formula for carrying out the transmutations. Most of 'his' work was aimed at gathering alchemical knowledge that had existed before him, especially as regarded the philosopher's stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Titus | last=Burckhardt | authorlink=Titus Burckhardt | title=Alchemy: Science of the Cosmos, Science of the Soul | location=Baltimore | publisher=Penguin | year=1967 | pages=170–181 | others=Trans. William Stoddart | isbn=0-906540-96-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the [[late Middle Ages]] (1300–1500) alchemists were much like Flamel: they concentrated on looking for the philosophers' stone. [[Bernard Trevisan]] and [[George Ripley (alchemist)|George Ripley]] made similar contributions in the 14th and 15th centuries. Their cryptic allusions and [[symbol]]ism led to wide variations in interpretation of the art.

===Alchemy in the Renaissance and modern age===
{{Further|Renaissance magic|natural magic}}
[[File:Raimundus Lullus alchemic page.jpg|thumb|right|Page from alchemic treatise of [[Ramon Llull]], 16th century]]

During the [[Renaissance]], Hermetic and Platonic foundations were restored to European alchemy. The dawn of medical, pharmaceutical, occult, and entrepreneurial branches of alchemy followed.

Francis Melville, in his translation of the Arabic Book of the Composition of Alchemy, commented on the Emerald Tablet and the Hermetic texts by stating, &quot;Here was an ancient body of theological, philosophical, scientific, and medical writings of extraordinary beauty, intellectual power, and spiritual authority, in which Jews, Christians, and Muslims could find confirmations, amplifications, and refinements of their own sacred teachings.&quot;

In the late 15th century, [[Marsilo Ficino]] translated the [[Corpus Hermeticum]] and the works of Plato into Latin. These were previously unavailable to Europeans who for the first time had a full picture of the alchemical theory that Bacon had declared absent. [[Renaissance Humanism]] and [[Renaissance Neoplatonism]] guided alchemists away from physics to refocus on mankind as the alchemical vessel.

Esoteric systems developed that blended alchemy into a broader occult Hermeticism, fusing it with magic, astrology, and Christian cabala. A key figure in this development was German [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] (1486–1535) who received his Hermetic education in Italy in the schools of the humanists. In his ''De Occulta Philosophia'' he attempted to merge [[Kabbalah]], Hermetism, and alchemy. He was instrumental in spreading this new blend of Hermeticism outside the borders of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Alexander Magee. ''Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition.'' Cornell University Press. 2008. p.30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke. ''The Western Esoteric Traditions: A Historical Introduction.'' Oxford University Press. 2008 p.60&lt;/ref&gt;

Philippus Aureolus [[Paracelsus]], (Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, 1493–1541) cast alchemy into a new form, rejecting some of Agrippa's occultism and moving away from [[chrysopoeia]]. Paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine, and wrote &quot;Many have said of Alchemy, that it is for the making of gold and silver. For me such is not the aim, but to consider only what virtue and power may lie in medicines.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Edwardes, Michael | title=The Dark Side of History | location=New York | publisher=Stein and Day | year=1977 | page=47 | isbn=0-552-11463-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His hermetical views were that sickness and health in the body relied on the harmony of man the microcosm and Nature the macrocosm. He took an approach different from those before him, using this analogy not in the manner of soul-purification but in the manner that humans must have certain balances of minerals in their bodies, and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Debus, Allen G.]] and Multhauf, Robert P. | title=Alchemy and Chemistry in the Seventeenth Century | location=Los Angeles | publisher=William Andrews Clark Memorial Library, University of California. | year=1966 | pages=6–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paracelsian practical alchemy, especially herbal medicine and plant remedies has since been named [[spagyrics]] (a synonym for alchemy from the Greek words meaning ''to separate'' and ''to join together'', based on the Latin alchemic maxim: ''solve et coagula'').&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Needham. ''Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 5, Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 5, Spagyrical Discovery and Invention: Physiological Alchemy.'' Cambridge University Press. P.9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iatrochemistry]] also refers to the pharmaceutical applications of alchemy championed by Paracelsus.

[[John Dee]] (13 July 1527 – December, 1608) followed Agrippa's occult tradition. Though better known for angel summoning, divination, and his role as [[astrologer]], cryptographer, and consultant to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]], Dee's alchemical ''Monas Hieroglyphica'', written in 1564 was his most popular and influential work. His writing portrayed alchemy as a sort of terrestrial astronomy in line with the Hermetic axiom ''As above so below''.&lt;ref&gt;William Royall Newman, Anthony Grafton. ''Secrets of Nature: Astrology and Alchemy in Early Modern Europe''. MIT Press, 2001. P.173.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alchemik Sedziwoj Matejko.JPG|thumb|left|250px|&quot;Alchemist [[Michał Sędziwój|Sędziwój]]&quot; (1566–1636) by [[Jan Matejko]], 1867]]

Entrepreneurial opportunities were not uncommon for the alchemists of Renaissance Europe. Alchemists were contracted by the elite for practical purposes related to mining, medical services, and the production of chemicals, medicines, metals, and gemstones.&lt;ref&gt;Tara E. Nummedal. ''Alchemy and authority in the Holy Roman Empire.'' p.4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor]], in the late 16th century, famously received and sponsored various alchemists at his court in Prague, including Dee and his associate [[Edward Kelley]]. [[James IV of Scotland|King James IV of Scotland]],&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. iii, (1901), 99, 202, 206, 209, 330, 340, 341, 353, 355, 365, 379, 382, 389, 409.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]], [[Henry V, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]], [[Augustus, Elector of Saxony]], [[Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn]], and [[Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel]] all contracted alchemists.&lt;ref&gt;Tara E. Nummedal. ''Alchemy and authority in the Holy Roman Empire.'' p.85-98&lt;/ref&gt; John's son [[Arthur Dee]] worked as a court physician to [[Michael I of Russia]] and [[Charles I of England]] but also compiled the alchemical book ''[[Fasciculus Chemicus]]''.

Though most of these appointments were legitimate, the trend of pseudo-alchemical fraud continued through the Renaissance. ''Betrüger'' would use sleight of hand, or claims of secret knowledge to make money or secure patronage. Legitimate mystical and medical alchemists such as [[Michael Maier]] and [[Heinrich Khunrath]] wrote about fraudulent transmutations, distinguishing themselves from the [[con artist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Tara E. Nummedal. ''Alchemy and authority in the Holy Roman Empire.'' p.171&lt;/ref&gt;  False alchemists were sometimes prosecuted for fraud.

The terms &quot;chemia&quot; and &quot;alchemia&quot; were used as synonyms in the early modern period, and the differences between alchemy, chemistry and small-scale assaying and metallurgy were not as neat as in the present day. There were important overlaps between practitioners, and trying to classify them into alchemists, chemists and craftsmen is anachronistic. For example, [[Tycho Brahe]] (1546–1601), an alchemist better known for his [[astronomical]] and [[astrological]] investigations, had a laboratory built at his [[Uraniborg]] observatory/research institute. [[Michał Sędziwój|Michael Sendivogius]] (''Michał Sędziwój'', 1566–1636), a [[Poland|Polish]] alchemist, philosopher, medical doctor and pioneer of chemistry wrote mystical works but is also credited with distilling [[oxygen]] in a lab sometime around 1600. Sendivogious taught his technique to [[Cornelius Drebbel]] who, in 1621, applied this in a submarine. [[Isaac Newton]] devoted considerably more of his writing to the study of alchemy (see [[Isaac Newton's occult studies]]) than he did to either optics or physics. Other early modern alchemists who were eminent in their other studies include [[Robert Boyle]], and [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]]. Their Hermetism complemented rather than precluded their practical achievements in medicine and science.

===The decline of European alchemy===
[[File:The Shannon Portrait of the Hon Robert Boyle.jpg|thumb|right|Robert Boyle]]
The decline of European alchemy was brought about by the rise of modern science with its emphasis on rigorous quantitative experimentation and its disdain for &quot;ancient wisdom&quot;. Although the seeds of these events were planted as early as the 17th century, alchemy still flourished for some two hundred years, and in fact may have reached its [[apogee]] in the 18th century. As late as 1781 [[James Price (chemist)|James Price]] claimed to have produced a powder that could transmute mercury into silver or gold.

[[Robert Boyle]] (1627–1691), better known for his studies of gases (cf. [[Boyle's law]]) pioneered the scientific method in chemical investigations. He assumed nothing in his experiments and compiled every piece of relevant data; in a typical experiment, Boyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out, the wind characteristics, the position of the Sun and Moon, and the barometer reading, all just in case they proved to be relevant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Pilkington, Roger | title=Robert Boyle: Father of Chemistry | location=London | publisher=John Murray | year=1959 | page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the 18th and 19th centuries, based on revolutionary discoveries of [[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier]] and [[John Dalton]] — which finally provided a logical, quantitative and reliable framework for understanding matter transmutations, and revealed the futility of longstanding alchemical goals such as the philosopher's stone.

Meanwhile, Paracelsian alchemy led to the development of modern medicine. Experimentalists gradually uncovered the workings of the human body, such as blood circulation ([[William Harvey|Harvey]], 1616), and eventually traced many diseases to infections with germs ([[Robert Koch|Koch]] and [[Louis Pasteur|Pasteur]], 19th century) or lack of ''natural'' nutrients and [[vitamin]]s ([[James Lind (physician)|Lind]], [[Christiaan Eijkman|Eijkman]], [[Casimir Funk|Funk]], et al.). Supported by parallel developments in organic chemistry, the new science easily displaced alchemy from its medical roles, interpretive and prescriptive, while deflating its hopes of miraculous elixirs and exposing the ineffectiveness or even toxicity of its remedies.

During the 17th century, a short-lived &quot;supernatural&quot; interpretation of alchemy became popular, including support by fellows of the [[Royal Society]]: [[Robert Boyle]] and [[Elias Ashmole]]. Proponents of the supernatural interpretation of alchemy believed that the [[philosopher's stone]] might be used to summon and communicate with angels.&lt;ref&gt;

The words &quot;alchemy&quot; and &quot;chemistry&quot; were used interchangeably during most of the 17th century; only during the 18th century was a distinction drawn rigidly between the two.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewmanPrincipe2002p37&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PrincipeNewmanp386&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=386}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century, &quot;alchemy&quot; was considered to be restricted to the realm of &quot;gold making&quot;, leading to the popular belief that most, if not all, alchemists were charlatans, and the tradition itself nothing more than a fraud.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrincipeNewmanp386&quot;/&gt; The obscure and secretive writings of the alchemists was used as a case by those who wished to forward a fraudulent and non-scientific opinion of alchemy.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrincipeNewmanp387&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=387}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to protect the developing science of modern chemistry from the negative censure of which alchemy was being subjected, academic writers during the scientific Enlightenment attempted, for the sake of survival, to separate and divorce the &quot;new&quot; chemistry from the &quot;old&quot; practices of alchemy. This move was mostly successful, and the consequences of this continued into the 19th and 20th centuries, and even to the present day.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrincipeNewmanpp386–7&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|pp=386–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the occult revival of the early 19th century, alchemy received new attention as an occult science.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrincipeNewmanp387&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KripalShuck2005p27&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kripal|Shuck|2005|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The esoteric or occultist school, which arose during the 19th century, held (and continues to hold) the view that the substances and operations mentioned in alchemical literature are to be interpreted in a spiritual sense, and it downplays the role of the alchemy as a practical tradition or protoscience.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewmanPrincipe2002p37&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eliade|1994|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PrincipeNewmanp388&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=388}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation further forwarded the view that alchemy is an art primarily concerned with spiritual enlightenment or illumination, as opposed to the physical manipulation of apparatus and chemicals, and claims that the obscure language of the alchemical texts were an allegorical guise for spiritual, moral or mystical processes.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrincipeNewmanp388&quot;/&gt;

In the 19th century revival of alchemy, the two most seminal figures were [[Mary Anne Atwood]] and [[Ethan A. Hitchcock (general)|Ethan Allen Hitchcock]], who independently published similar works regarding spiritual alchemy. Both forwarded a completely esoteric view of alchemy, as Atwood claimed: &quot;No modern art or chemistry, notwithstanding all its surreptitious claims, has any thing in common with Alchemy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PrincipeNewmanp391&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=391}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rutkin2001p143&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rutkin|2001|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atwood's work influenced subsequent authors of the occult revival including [[Eliphas Levi]], [[Arthur Edward Waite]], and [[Rudolf Steiner]]. Hitchcock, in his ''Remarks Upon Alchymists'' (1855) attempted to make a case for his spiritual interpretation with his claim that the alchemists wrote about a spiritual discipline under a materialistic guise in order to avoid accusations of blasphemy from the church and state. In 1845, Baron [[Carl Reichenbach]], published his studies on [[Odic force]], a concept with some similarities to alchemy, but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Merkur.

===Indian alchemy===
{{Main|Rasayana}}
{{See also|History of metallurgy in the Indian subcontinent}}

According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, the [[Vedas]] describe a connection between eternal life and gold. The use of [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] for alchemy is first documented in the 4th- to 3rd-century BC [[Arthashastra|Artha-śāstra]]. [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] texts from 2nd- to 5th-century AD mention the transmutation of base metals to gold. Greek alchemy was introduced to Ancient India through the invasions of [[Alexander the Great]] in 325 BC, and kingdoms that were culturally influenced by the Greeks like [[Gandhāra]].&lt;ref&gt;Multhauf, Robert P. &amp; Gilbert, Robert Andrew (2008). ''Alchemy''. Encyclopædia Britannica (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

An 11th-century [[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam|Persian chemist]] and [[Medicine in medieval Islam|physician]] named [[Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī]] reported that they &quot;have a science similar to alchemy which is quite peculiar to them, which in [[Sanskrit]] is called [[Rasayāna]] and in Persian [[Rasavātam]]. It means the art of obtaining/manipulating ''Rasa'': nectar, mercury, and juice. This art was restricted to certain operations, metals, drugs, compounds, and medicines, many of which have mercury as their core element. Its principles restored the health of those who were ill beyond hope and gave back youth to fading old age.&quot; One thing is sure though, Indian alchemy like every other Indian science is focused on finding [[Moksha]]: perfection, immortality, liberation. As such it focuses its efforts on transmutation of the human body: from mortal to immortal. Many are the traditional stories of alchemists still alive since time immemorial due to the effects of their experiments.

Since alchemy eventually became ingrained in the vast field of Indian erudition, influences from other metaphysical and philosophical doctrines such as [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga]], [[Vaisheshika]] and [[Ayurveda]] were inevitable. Nonetheless, most of the [[Rasayāna]] texts track their origins back to [[Kaula]] tantric schools associated to the teachings of the personality of [[Matsyendranath]].

Two famous early Indian alchemical authors were [[Nagarjuna (metallurgist)|Nāgārjuna Siddha]] and Nityanātha Siddha. Nāgārjuna Siddha was a Buddhist monk. His book, ''Rasendramangalam'', is an example of Indian alchemy and medicine. Nityanātha Siddha wrote ''Rasaratnākara'', also a highly influential work. In Sanskrit, &quot;rasa&quot; translates as &quot;mercury&quot; and Nāgārjuna Siddha was said to have developed a method or converting mercury into gold.&lt;ref&gt;See Dominik Wujastyk, &quot;An Alchemical Ghost: The Rasaratnākara of Nāgarjuna&quot; in ''Ambix'' 31.2 (1984): 70-83. Online at http://univie.academia.edu/DominikWujastyk/Papers/152766/&lt;/ref&gt;

Reliable scholarship on Indian alchemy has been advanced in a major way by the publication of ''The Alchemical Body'' by David Gordon White.&lt;ref&gt;See bibliographical details and links at http://openlibrary.org/works/OL3266066W/The_Alchemical_Body&lt;/ref&gt;  Trustworthy scholarship on Indian alchemy must now take the findings of this work into account.

An important modern bibliography on Indian alchemical studies has also been provided by David Gordon White at [http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195399318/obo-9780195399318-0046.xml?rskey=skoSqW&amp;result=1&amp;q=rasayana#firstMatch Oxford Bibliographies Online].&lt;ref&gt;DOI: 10.1093/OBO/9780195399318-0046&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese alchemy===
{{Main|Chinese alchemy}}
[[File:Esoteric Taijitu.svg|thumb| upright=0.5|Taoist Alchemists often use this alternate version of the [[Taijitu]].]]

Whereas European alchemy eventually centered on the transmutation of base metals into noble ones, Chinese alchemy had a more obvious connection to medicine. The [[philosopher's stone]] of European alchemists can be compared to the [[Elixir of life|Grand Elixir of Immortality]] sought by Chinese alchemists. However, in the hermetic view, these two goals were not unconnected, and the philosopher's stone was often equated with the [[universal panacea]]; therefore, the two traditions may have had more in common than initially appears.

[[Black powder]] may have been an important invention of Chinese alchemists. As previously stated above, [[China|Chinese]] alchemy was more related to medicine. It is said that the Chinese invented gunpowder while trying to find a [[potion]] for eternal life. Described in 9th-century texts and used in [[fireworks]] in China by the 10th century, it was used in [[cannon]]s by 1290. From China, the use of [[gunpowder]] spread to Japan, the [[Mongol]]s, the Arab world, and Europe. Gunpowder was used by the Mongols against the Hungarians in 1241, and in Europe by the 14th century.

Chinese alchemy was closely connected to [[Taoist]] forms of [[traditional Chinese medicine]], such as [[Acupuncture]] and [[Moxibustion]], and to martial arts such as [[T'ai chi ch'uan|Tai Chi Chuan]] and [[Kung Fu]] (although some Tai Chi schools believe that their art derives from the philosophical or hygienic branches of Taoism, not Alchemical). In fact, in the early [[Song Dynasty]], followers of this Taoist idea (chiefly the elite and upper class) would ingest [[cinnabar|mercuric sulfide]], which, though tolerable in low levels, led many to suicide. Thinking that this consequential death would lead to freedom and access to the Taoist heavens, the ensuing deaths encouraged people to eschew this method of alchemy in favor of external sources (the aforementioned Tai Chi Chuan, mastering of the [[Qi]], etc.).

===Alchemy as a subject of historical research===
The history of alchemy has become a significant and recognized subject of academic study.&lt;ref name=&quot;Antoine Faivre 1995. p.viii–xv&quot;&gt;Antoine Faivre, Wouter J. Hanegraaff. ''Western esotericism and the science of religion.'' 1995. p.viii–xvi&lt;/ref&gt;   As the language of the alchemists is analyzed, historians are becoming more aware of the intellectual connections between that discipline and other facets of Western cultural history, such as the evolution of science and [[philosophy]], the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities, [[Kabbalah|kabbalism]], [[spiritualism]], [[Rosicrucianism]], and other mystic movements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://centres.exeter.ac.uk/exeseso/ See Exeter Centre for the Study of Esotericism website]&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions involved in this research include The Chymistry of Isaac Newton project at [[University of Indiana|Indiana University]], the [[University of Exeter]] Centre for the Study of Esotericism (EXESESO), the [[European Society for the Study of Western Esotericism]] (ESSWE), and the [[University of Amsterdam|University of Amsterdam's]] Sub-department for the History of Hermetic Philosophy and Related Currents. A large collection of books on alchemy is kept in the [[Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica]] in Amsterdam. 
Journals which publish regularly on the topic of Alchemy include '[[Ambix]]', published by the Society for the History of alchemy and Chemistry, and '[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]', published by The History of Science Society.

==Modern alchemy==
Due to the complexity and obscurity of alchemical literature, and the 18th century disappearance of remaining alchemical practitioners into the area of chemistry; the general understanding of alchemy has been strongly influenced by several distinct and radically different interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=385}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those focusing on the exoteric, such as historians of science [[Lawrence M. Principe]] and [[William R. Newman]], have interpreted the 'decknamen' (or code words) of alchemy as physical substances. These practitioners have reconstructed physicochemical experiments that they say are described in medieval and early modern texts.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Conniff. &quot;Alchemy May Not Have Been the Pseudoscience We All Thought It Was.&quot; [http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/alchemy-may-not-been-pseudoscience-we-thought-it-was-180949430/#ixzz2sYcrpZl7 Smithsonian Magazine.] February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the opposite end of the spectrum, esoteric alchemists interpret these same decknamen as spiritual, religious, or psychological concepts. Today new interpretations of alchemy are still perpetuated, sometimes merging in concepts from [[New Age]] or radical environmentalism movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=396}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups like the rosicrucians and freemasons have a continued interest in alchemy and its symbolism.

===Alchemy in traditional medicine===
Traditional medicine sometimes involves the transmutation of natural substances, using pharmacological or a combination of pharmacological and spiritual techniques. In [[Ayurveda]] the [[Samskara (Ayurvedic)|samskaras]] are claimed to transform [[heavy metals]] and toxic herbs in a way that removes their toxicity. These processes are actively used to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Junius, Manfred M; ''The Practical Handbook of Plant Alchemy: An Herbalist's Guide to Preparing Medicinal Essences, Tinctures, and Elixirs''; Healing Arts Press 1985&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Spagyrists of the 20th century [[Frater Albertus|Albert Richard Riedel]] and Jean Dubuis merged Paracelsian alchemy with occultism, teaching laboratory pharmaceutical methods. The schools they founded, ''Les Philosophes de la Nature'' and ''The Paracelsus Research Society'', popularized modern spagyrics including the manufacture of herbal tinctures and products.&lt;ref&gt;Joscelyn Godwin.  ''The Golden Thread: The Ageless Wisdom of the Western Mystery Traditions.'' Quest Books, 2007. p.120&lt;/ref&gt; The courses, books, organizations, and conferences generated by their students continue to influence popular applications of alchemy as a new age medicinal practice.

=== Psychology ===
Alchemical symbolism has been used by [[psychology|psychologists]] such as [[Carl Jung]] who reexamined alchemical symbolism and theory and presented the inner meaning of alchemical work as a [[spirituality|spiritual]] path.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jung, C. G. 1944&quot;&gt;Jung, C. G. (1944). Psychology and Alchemy (2nd ed. 1968 Collected Works Vol. 12 ISBN 0-691-01831-6). London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C. G., &amp; Hinkle, B. M. (1912). Psychology of the Unconscious : a study of the transformations and symbolisms of the libido, a contribution to the history of the evolution of thought. London: Kegan Paul Trench Trubner. (revised in 1952 as Symbols of Transformation, Collected Works Vol.5 ISBN 0-691-01815-4).&lt;/ref&gt; Jung was deeply interested in the occult since his youth, participating in seances, which he used as the basis for his doctoral dissertation &quot;On the Psychology and Pathology of So-Called Occult Phenomena.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Jung Cult'', by Ricard Noll, ''Princeton University Press'', 1994, '''p144'''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, Jung had already adopted a &quot;spiritualist and redemptive interpretation of alchemy&quot;, likely reflecting his interest in the occult literature of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Noll. ''Aryan Christ''. '''p171'''&lt;/ref&gt; Jung began writing his views on alchemy from the 1920s and continued until the end of his life. His interpretation of [[Chinese alchemy|Chinese alchemical texts]] in terms of his [[analytical psychology]] also served the function of comparing Eastern and Western alchemical imagery and core concepts and hence its possible inner sources ([[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]]).&lt;ref&gt;C.-G. Jung Preface to [[Richard Wilhelm (sinologist)|Richard Wilhelm]]'s translation of the [[I Ching]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.-G. Jung Preface to the translation of [[Secret of the Golden Flower|The Secret of The Golden Flower]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Polly Young-Eisendrath, Terence Dawson. ''The Cambridge companion to Jung.'' Cambridge University Press. 1997. p.33&quot;&gt;Polly Young-Eisendrath, Terence Dawson.  ''The Cambridge companion to Jung.'' Cambridge University Press. 1997. p.33&lt;/ref&gt;

Jung saw alchemy as a Western proto-psychology dedicated to the achievement of [[individuation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jung, C. G. 1944&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Polly Young-Eisendrath, Terence Dawson.  ''The Cambridge companion to Jung.'' Cambridge University Press. 1997. p.33&quot;/&gt; In his interpretation, alchemy was the vessel by which [[Gnosticism]] survived its various purges into the [[Renaissance]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Polly Young-Eisendrath, Terence Dawson.  ''The Cambridge companion to Jung.'' Cambridge University Press. 1997. p.33&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C. G., &amp; Jaffe A. (1962). Memories, Dreams, Reflections. London: Collins. This is Jung's autobiography, recorded and edited by Aniela Jaffe, ISBN 0-679-72395-1.&lt;/ref&gt; a concept also followed by others such as [[Stephan A. Hoeller]]. In this sense, Jung viewed alchemy as comparable to a [[Yoga]] of the East, and more adequate to the Western mind than Eastern religions and philosophies. The practice of Alchemy seemed to change the mind and spirit of the Alchemist. Conversely, spontaneous changes on the mind of Western people undergoing any important stage in individuation seems to produce, on occasion, imagery known to Alchemy and relevant to the person's situation.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C. G.—Psychology and Alchemy; Symbols of Transformation.&lt;/ref&gt; Jung did not completely reject the material experiments of the alchemists, but he massively downplayed it, writing that the transmutation was performed in the mind of the alchemist. He claimed the material substances and procedures were only a projection of the alchemists' internal state, while the real substance to be transformed was the mind itself.&lt;ref&gt;''Redemption in Alchemy'', by Carl Jung, '''p210'''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marie-Louise von Franz]], a disciple of Jung, continued Jung's studies on alchemy and its psychological meaning. Jung's work exercised a great influence on the mainstream perception of alchemy, his approach becoming a stock element in many popular texts on the subject to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=401}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars are sometimes critical of the Jungian approach to alchemy as overly reflective of 19th-century occultism.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewmanPrincipe2002p37&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KripalShuck2005p27&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Magnum opus ==
{{Main|Magnum opus (alchemy)}}
The Great Work of Alchemy is often described as a series of four stages represented by colors.
*''[[nigredo]]'', a blackening or melanosis
*''[[Albedo (alchemy)|albedo]]'', a whitening or leucosis
*''[[citrinitas]]'', a yellowing or xanthosis
*''[[rubedo]]'', a reddening, purpling, or iosis&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Needham. ''Science &amp; Civilisation in China: Chemistry and chemical technology. Spagyrical discovery and invention: magisteries of gold and immortality.'' Cambridge. 1974. p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alchemy in art and entertainment ==
{{Main|Alchemy in art and entertainment}}
Alchemy has had a long standing relationship with art, seen both in alchemical texts and in mainstream entertainment. ''Literary alchemy'' appears throughout the history of English literature from Shakespeare to J. K. Rowling. Here, characters or plot structure follow an alchemical magnum opus. In the 14th century, Chaucer began a trend of alchemical satire that can still be seen in recent fantasy works like those of Terry Pratchett.

Visual artists had a similar relationship with alchemy. While some of them used alchemy as a source of satire, others worked with the alchemists themselves or integrated alchemical thought or symbols in their work. Music was also present in the works of alchemists and continues to influence popular performers. In the last hundred years, alchemists have been portrayed in a magical and spagyric role in fantasy fiction, film, television, comics and video games.

[[File:JohannesVermeer-TheAstronomer(1668).jpg|thumb|250px|''[[The Astronomer (Vermeer)|The Astronomer]]'' by [[Johannes Vermeer]] (c. 1668)]]

An '''astronomer''' is a scientist who studies [[Celestial body|celestial bodies]] such as [[black hole]]s, [[moon]]s, [[planet]]s, [[star]]s, [[nebula]]e, and [[Galaxy|galaxies]], as well as [[Gamma-ray burst]]s and [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. A related but distinct subject, [[cosmology]], is concerned with studying the [[universe]] as a whole. An astronomer researches the world beyond earth.

Historically, [[astronomy]] was more concerned with the classification and description of [[phenomena]] in the sky, while [[astrophysics]] attempted to explain these phenomena and the differences between them using physical laws. Today, that distinction has mostly disappeared and the terms &quot;astronomer&quot; and &quot;astrophysicist&quot; are interchangeable. Professional astronomers are highly educated individuals who typically have a PhD in [[physics]] or astronomy and are employed by research institutions or universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.noao.edu/education/astfaq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Becoming an Astronomer |accessdate=29 March 2009 |work= |publisher=NOAO| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090403101540/http://www.noao.edu/education/astfaq.html| archivedate= 3 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; They spend the majority of their time working on research, although they quite often have other duties such as teaching, building instruments, or aiding in the operation of an observatory. The number of professional astronomers in the United States is actually quite small. The [[American Astronomical Society]], which is the major organization of professional astronomers in North America, has approximately 7,700 members. This number includes scientists from other fields such as physics, [[geology]], and [[engineering]], whose research interests are closely related to astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aas.org/ |title=American Astronomical Society Home |accessdate=14 August 2009 |work= |publisher=AAS| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090802044012/http://aas.org/| archivedate= 2 August 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Astronomical Union]] comprises almost 10,145 members from 70 different countries who are involved in astronomical research at the PhD level and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iau.org/about/ |title=About IAU |accessdate=14 August 2009 |work= |publisher=IAU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is a relatively low number of professional astronomers,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} the field is popular among [[amateurs]]. Most cities have [[amateur astronomy]] clubs that meet on a regular basis and often host [[star party|star parties]]. The [[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] is the largest general astronomical society in the world, comprising both professional and amateur astronomers as well as educators from 70 different nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astrosociety.org/about.html |title=About Us |accessdate=29 March 2009 |work= |publisher=Astronomical Society of the Pacific| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090225074145/http://astrosociety.org/about.html| archivedate= 25 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like any [[hobby]], most people who think of themselves as amateur astronomers may devote a few hours a month to [[stargazing]] and reading the latest developments in research. However, amateurs span the range from so-called &quot;armchair astronomers&quot; to the very ambitious, who own science-grade [[telescope]]s and instruments with which they are able to make their own discoveries and assist professional astronomers in research.

==Modern astronomers==
[[Image:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Galileo]] is often referred to as the Father of Modern Astronomy.]]
Contrary to the classical image of an old astronomer peering through a telescope through the dark hours of the night, it is far more common to use a [[charge-coupled device]] camera to record a long, deep exposure, allowing a more sensitive image to be created because the [[light]] is added over time. Before CCDs, [[photographic plates]] were a common method of observation. Modern astronomers spend relatively little time at telescopes - most spend a few weeks per year. Analysis of observed phenomena or make predictions for observational astronomers.

Astronomers who serve as faculty spend much of their time teaching undergraduate and graduate classes. Most universities also have outreach programs including public telescope time and sometimes [[planetarium]]s as a public service to encourage interest in the field.

&lt;/ref&gt; and especially refer to a creature moving by using [[pseudopod]]ia. Most references to &quot;amoebas&quot; or &quot;amoebae&quot; are to amoeboids in general rather than to the specific genus ''[[Amoeba]]''. The genus ''Amoeba'' and amoeboids in general both derive their names from the ancient Greek word for change.

==Shape and structure==
Amoeboids [[Amoeboid movement|move using pseudopodia]], which are bulges of [[cytoplasm]].

Amoebas breathe using their entire [[cell membrane]] that is constantly immersed in water. Excess water can cross into the [[cytosol]]. Amoebas have a contractile [[vacuole]] to expel excess water.

Food sources vary in amoeboids. They may consume bacteria or other [[protist]]s. Some are [[detritivore]]s and eat dead organic material. They extend a pair of pseudopodia around food. They fuse to make a food vacuole which then fuses with a [[lysosome]] to add digestive chemicals. Undigested food is expelled at the cell membrane.

Amoebas use pseudopodia to move and feed. They are powered by flexible [[microfilament]]s near the membrane. Microfilaments are at least 50% of the [[cytoskeleton]]. The other parts are more stiff and are composed of [[intermediate filament]]s and [[microtubule]]s. These are not used in amoeboid movement, but are stiff skeletons on which [[organelles]] are supported or can move on.

The shells of amoebas are often composed of [[calcium]]. The proteins or materials are synthesised in the cell and exported just outside the cell membrane.

===Multicellular amoebas: Slime molds===
{{main|Slime mold}}
Amoebas seem to have connections with two phyla (now defunct) composed of [[multicellular organism]]s of the lineage of fungus-like protists, the so-called [[slime mold]]s. These two defunct phyla were the [[Myxomycota]] (i.e., plasmodial slime molds, now classified in the taxon [[Myxogastria]]), and [[Acrasiomycota]] (i.e. cellular slime molds, now divided into the taxa [[Acrasida]] and [[Dictyosteliida]]). These two phyla use amoeboid movement in their feeding stage. The former is basically a giant [[multinucleate]] amoeba, while the latter lives solitary until food runs out; in which a colony of these functions as a unit. Myxomycete slime molds use amoeboid gametes, as well.

==Diversity==
They have appeared in a number of different groups. Some cells in multicellular animals may be amoeboid, for instance human [[white blood cell]]s, which consume pathogens. Many [[protist]]s also exist as individual amoeboid cells, or take such a form at some point in their life-cycle. The most famous such organism is ''[[Amoeba|Amoeba proteus]]''; the name amoeba is variously used to describe its close relatives, other organisms similar to it, or the amoeboids in general.

==Classification==
As amoebas themselves are [[polyphyletic]] and subject to some imprecision in definition, the term &quot;amoeboid&quot; does not provide identification of an organism, and is better understood as description of locomotion.

When used in the broader sense, the term can include many different groups. One source includes 97 different genera.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlThe Amoebae&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bms.ed.ac.uk/research/others/smaciver/amoebae.htm |title=The Amoebae |work= |accessdate=2 May 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090412100203/http://www.bms.ed.ac.uk/research/others/smaciver/amoebae.htm| archivedate= 12 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others include far fewer.

===Older classification===
In older classification systems, amoeboids, under the taxon name '''Sarcodina''', had been divided into several [[Morphology (biology)#Morphology and classification|morphological categories]] based on the form and structure of their [[pseudopod]]s.

Amoeboids with pseudopods supported by regular arrays of [[microtubule]]s were called '''actinopods''', whereas those that weren't were called '''rhizopods''', which were further subdivided into lobose, filose, and reticulose amoebae. In contrast to &quot;rhizopods&quot;, where most of their morphologies can be mapped to modern classification systems, &quot;actinopods&quot; appear to be extensively [[polyphyletic]]. Actinopods are divided into [[radiolaria]] and [[heliozoa]] (itself a polyphyletic grouping).

Finally, there was also a strange group of giant marine amoeboids, the [[xenophyophore]]s, that did not fall into any of these categories.

===Modern classification===
More modern classifications are based upon [[cladistics]]. It has been stated that most amoeboid are now grouped in [[Amoebozoa]] or [[Rhizaria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19335771&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pawlowski J, Burki F |title=Untangling the phylogeny of amoeboid protists |journal=J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. |volume=56 |issue=1 |pages=16–25 |year=2009 |pmid=19335771 |doi=10.1111/j.1550-7408.2008.00379.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in contexts where &quot;amoeboid&quot; is defined more loosely, there are many amoeboid species that are in the [[Excavata]] clade.

Phylogenetic analyses place these genera into the following groups (not all of these are considered amoeboid (or &quot;amoebas&quot;) by all sources):

*''[[Naegleria fowleri]]'' (the &quot;brain-eating amoeba&quot;) is a fresh-water-native species that can be fatal to humans if introduced through the nose.
*''[[Acanthamoeba]]'' can cause amoebic [[keratitis]] and [[encephalitis]] in humans.
*''[[Balamuthia mandrillaris]]'' is the cause of (often fatal) [[granulomatous amoebic meningoencephalitis]]

ASCII codes represent text in [[computer]]s, [[communications equipment]], and other devices that use text.  Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, though they support many additional characters.

ASCII developed from [[Telegraph code|telegraphic codes]]. Its first commercial use was as a seven-[[bit]] [[teleprinter]] code promoted by Bell data services. Work on the ASCII standard began on October 6, 1960, with the first meeting of the [[American Standards Association]]'s (ASA) X3.2 subcommittee. The first edition of the standard was published during 1963,&lt;ref name=&quot;Brandel&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Mary |last=Brandel |date=July 6, 1999 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9907/06/1963.idg/ |title=1963: The Debut of ASCII |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=2008-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=American Standard Code for Information Interchange, ASA X3.4-1963 |publisher=American Standards Association |date=June 17, 1963 |url=http://www.wps.com/J/codes/X3.4-1963/ |accessdate=2013-12-23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a major revision during 1967,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=USA Standard Code for Information Interchange, USAS X3.4-1967 |publisher=United States of America Standards Institute |date=July 7, 1967 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==History==
The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) was developed under the auspices of a committee of the American Standards Association, called the X3 committee, by its X3.2 (later X3L2) subcommittee, and later by that subcommittee's X3.2.4 working group. The ASA became the United States of America Standards Institute or USASI&lt;ref name=&quot;FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980211&quot;&gt;[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], p.&amp;nbsp;211.&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately the [[American National Standards Institute]].

The X3.2 subcommittee designed ASCII based on the earlier [[teleprinter]] encoding systems. Like other [[character encoding]]s, ASCII specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and [[character (computing)|character]] symbols (i.e. [[grapheme]]s and [[control character]]s). This allows [[Digital data|digital]] devices to communicate with each other and to process, store, and communicate character-oriented information such as written language. Before ASCII was developed, the encodings in use included 26 [[English alphabet|alphabetic]] characters, 10 [[numerical digit]]s, and from 11 to 25 special graphic symbols.
To include all these, and control characters compatible with the [[CCITT|Comité Consultatif International Téléphonique et Télégraphique]] (CCITT) [[International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2]] (ITA2) standard, [[Fieldata]], and early [[EBCDIC]], more than 64 codes were required for ASCII.

The committee debated the possibility of a [[shift key]] function (like the [[Baudot code]]), which would allow more than 64 codes to be represented by six [[bit]]s. In a shifted code, some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes.
It allows compact encoding, but is less reliable for [[data transmission]]; an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable. The standards committee decided against shifting, and so ASCII required at least a seven-bit code.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980p. 215, Decision 4&quot;&gt;[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], p. 215, Decision 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The committee considered an eight-bit code, since eight bits ([[octet (computing)|octet]]s) would allow two four-bit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with [[binary coded decimal]]. However, it would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice. The committee voted to use a seven-bit code to minimize costs associated with data transmission. Since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position, it also allowed for a [[parity bit]] for [[error checking]] if desired.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980p. 217, Decision 5&quot;&gt;[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], p. 217, Decision 5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eight-bit]] machines (with octets as the native data type) that did not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to 0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Stanley A. Sawyer, Steven George Krantz |title=A TeX Primer for Scientists |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bXLDwmIJNkUC&amp;pg=PA13 |year=1995 |publisher=[[CRC Press|CRC Press, LLC]] |isbn=978-0-8493-7159-2 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together, and all graphic codes were together, for ease of identification. The first two columns (32 positions) were reserved for control characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980p. 220, Decisions 8,9&quot;&gt;[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], p. 220, Decisions 8,9.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Space (punctuation)|&quot;space&quot; character]] had to come before graphics to make [[sorting algorithm|sorting]] easier, so it became position 20&lt;sub&gt;[[hexadecimal|hex]]&lt;/sub&gt;;&lt;ref name=&quot;FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980p. 237, Decision 10&quot;&gt;[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], p. 237, Decision 10.&lt;/ref&gt; for the same reason, many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits.  The committee decided it was important to support [[upper case]] [[sixbit code pages|64-character alphabets]], and chose to pattern ASCII so it could be reduced easily to a usable 64-character set of graphic codes.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980p. 228, Decision 14&quot;&gt;[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], p. 228, Decision 14.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lower case]] letters were therefore not interleaved with upper case. To keep options available for lower case letters and other graphics, the special and numeric codes were arranged before the letters, and the letter &quot;A&quot; was placed in position 41&lt;sub&gt;[[hexadecimal|hex]]&lt;/sub&gt; to match the draft of the corresponding British standard.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980p. 238, Decision 18&quot;&gt;[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], p. 238, Decision 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The digits 0–9 were arranged so they correspond to values in binary prefixed with 011, making conversion with [[binary-coded decimal]] straightforward.

Many of the non-alphanumeric characters were positioned to correspond to their shifted position on typewriters. Thus #, $ and % were placed to correspond to 3, 4, and 5 in the adjacent column. The parentheses could not correspond to 9 and 0, however, because the place corresponding to 0 was taken by the space character. Since many European typewriters placed the parentheses with 8 and 9, those corresponding positions were chosen for the parentheses. The @ symbol was not used in continental Europe and the committee expected it would be replaced by an accented À in the French variation, so the @ was placed in position 40&lt;sub&gt;[[hexadecimal|hex]]&lt;/sub&gt; next to the letter A.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980243&quot;&gt;[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], p.&amp;nbsp;243.&lt;/ref&gt;

The control codes felt essential for data transmission were the start of message (SOM), end of address (EOA), [[End of Message|end of message]] (EOM), end of transmission (EOT), &quot;who are you?&quot; (WRU), &quot;are you?&quot; (RU), a reserved device control (DC0), synchronous idle (SYNC), and acknowledge (ACK). These were positioned to maximize the [[Hamming distance]] between their bit patterns.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980243-245&quot;&gt;[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], pp.&amp;nbsp;243-245.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the other special characters and control codes filled in, ASCII was published as ASA X3.4-1963, leaving 28 code positions without any assigned meaning, reserved for future standardization, and one unassigned control code.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOOTNOTEMackenzie198066, 245&quot;&gt;[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], pp.&amp;nbsp;66, 245.&lt;/ref&gt; There was some debate at the time whether there should be more control characters rather than the lower case alphabet.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980435&quot;&gt;[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], p.&amp;nbsp;435.&lt;/ref&gt; The indecision did not last long: during May 1963 the CCITT Working Party on the New Telegraph Alphabet proposed to assign lower case characters to columns 6 and 7,&lt;ref&gt;Brief Report: Meeting of CCITT Working Party on the New Telegraph Alphabet, May 13–15, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[International Organization for Standardization]] TC 97 SC 2 voted during October to incorporate the change into its draft standard.&lt;ref&gt;Report of ISO/TC/97/SC 2 – Meeting of October 29–31, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; The X3.2.4 task group voted its approval for the change to ASCII at its May 1963 meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Report on Task Group X3.2.4, June 11, 1963, Pentagon Building, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt;  Locating the lowercase letters in columns 6 and 7 caused the characters to differ in bit pattern from the upper case by a single bit, which simplified [[case-insensitive]] character matching and the construction of keyboards and printers.

The X3 committee made other changes, including other new characters (the [[bracket|brace]] and [[vertical bar]] characters),&lt;ref&gt;Report of Meeting No. 8, Task Group X3.2.4, December 17 and 18, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; renaming some control characters (SOM became start of header (SOH)) and moving or removing others (RU was removed).&lt;ref name=&quot;FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980247–248&quot;&gt;[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], p.&amp;nbsp;247–248.&lt;/ref&gt; ASCII was subsequently updated as USASI X3.4-1967, then USASI X3.4-1968, ANSI X3.4-1977, and finally, ANSI X3.4-1986 (the first two are occasionally retronamed ANSI X3.4-1967, and ANSI X3.4-1968).

The X3 committee also addressed how ASCII should be transmitted ([[least significant bit]] first), and how it should be recorded on perforated tape. They proposed a [[9-track]] standard for magnetic tape, and attempted to deal with some forms of [[punched card]] formats.

ASCII itself was first used commercially during 1963 as a seven-bit teleprinter code for [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph]]'s TWX (TeletypeWriter eXchange) network. TWX originally used the earlier five-bit [[Baudot code]], which was also used by the competing [[Telex]] teleprinter system. [[Bob Bemer]] introduced features such as the [[Escape character|escape sequence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brandel&quot; /&gt; His British colleague [[Hugh McGregor Ross]] helped to popularize this work—according to Bemer, &quot;so much so that the code that was to become ASCII was first called the Bemer-Ross Code in Europe&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Bemer (n.d.). [http://www.trailing-edge.com/~bobbemer/EUROPE.HTM Bemer meets Europe]. ''Trailing-edge.com''. Accessed 2008-04-14. Employed at [[IBM]] at that time&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his extensive work on ASCII, Bemer has been called &quot;the father of ASCII.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;thocp&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thocp.net/biographies/bemer_bob.htm |title=Biography of Robert William Bemer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- &quot;The endorsement of the Federal government, then the largest purchaser of computer equipment, was probably the single most important reason for the subsequent wide adoption of ASCII.&quot; – Martha M. Gray [http://csrc.nist.gov/fips/fips1861.pdf]. /* ?? */ --&gt;
On March 11, 1968, U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] mandated that all computers purchased by the United States federal government support ASCII, stating:&lt;ref&gt;Lyndon B. Johnson (March 11, 1968). [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=28724 Memorandum Approving the Adoption by the Federal Government of a Standard Code for Information Interchange]. ''The American Presidency Project''. Accessed 2008-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have also approved recommendations of the [[Secretary of Commerce]] regarding standards for recording the Standard Code for Information Interchange on magnetic tapes and paper tapes when they are used in computer operations.
All computers and related equipment configurations brought into the [[Federal Government]] inventory on and after July 1, 1969, must have the capability to use the Standard Code for Information Interchange and the formats prescribed by the magnetic tape and paper tape standards when these media are used.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as [[ISO/IEC 646]] that are identical or nearly identical to ASCII, with extensions for characters outside the English [[alphabet]] and symbols used outside the United States, such as the symbol for the United Kingdom's [[pound sterling]] (£). Almost every country needed an adapted version of ASCII, since ASCII suited the needs of only the USA and a few other countries. For example, Canada had its own version that supported French characters. Other adapted encodings include [[ISCII]] (India), [[VISCII]] (Vietnam), and [[YUSCII]] (Yugoslavia). Although these encodings are sometimes referred to as ASCII, true ASCII is defined strictly only by the ANSI standard.

ASCII was incorporated into the [[Unicode]] character set as the first 128 symbols, so the ASCII characters have the same numeric codes in both sets. This allows [[UTF-8]] to be [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with ASCII, allowing software that handles UTF-8 data to treat ASCII data as UTF-8 data, and software made for ASCII treat UTF-8 data as ASCII data, rather than distinguishing between ASCII and UTF-8.

==ASCII control characters==
{{main|Control character}}

ASCII reserves the first 32 codes (numbers 0–31 decimal) for [[control character]]s: codes originally intended not to represent printable information, but rather to control devices (such as [[computer printer|printer]]s) that make use of ASCII, or to provide [[Metadata|meta-information]] about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape. 

For example, character 10 represents the &quot;line feed&quot; function (which causes a printer to advance its paper), and character 8 represents &quot;backspace&quot;. RFC 2822 refers to control characters that do not include carriage return, line feed or [[Whitespace (computer science)|white space]] as non-whitespace control characters.&lt;ref&gt;RFC 2822 (April 2001). &quot;NO-WS-CTL&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Except for the control characters that prescribe elementary line-oriented formatting, ASCII does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document. Other schemes, such as [[markup language]]s, address page and document layout and formatting.

The original ASCII standard used only short descriptive phrases for each control character. The ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional, for example where a character would be used slightly differently on a terminal link than on a [[data stream]], and sometimes accidental, for example with the meaning of &quot;delete&quot;.

Probably the most influential single device on the interpretation of these characters was the [[Teletype Model 33]] ASR, which was a printing terminal with an available [[punched tape|paper tape]] reader/punch option. Paper tape was a very popular medium for long-term program storage until the 1980s, less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape. In particular, the Teletype Model 33 machine assignments for codes 17 (Control-Q, DC1, also known as XON), 19 (Control-S, DC3, also known as XOFF), and 127 ([[Delete key|Delete]]) became de facto standards. Because the keytop for the O key also showed a left-arrow symbol (from ASCII-1963, which had this character instead of [[underscore]]), a noncompliant use of code 15 (Control-O, Shift In) interpreted as &quot;delete previous character&quot; was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected.

The use of Control-S (XOFF, an abbreviation for transmit off) as a &quot;handshaking&quot; signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending overflow, and Control-Q (XON, &quot;transmit on&quot;) to resume sending, persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique. On some systems Control-S retains its meaning but Control-Q is replaced by a second Control-S to resume output.

Code 127 is officially named &quot;delete&quot; but the Teletype label was &quot;rubout&quot;. Since the original standard did not give detailed interpretation for most control codes, interpretations of this code varied. The original Teletype meaning, and the intent of the standard, was to make it an ignored character, the same as NUL (all zeroes). This was useful specifically for paper tape, because punching the all-ones bit pattern on top of an existing mark would obliterate it. Tapes designed to be &quot;hand edited&quot; could even be produced with spaces of extra NULs (blank tape) so that a block of characters could be &quot;rubbed out&quot; and then replacements put into the empty space.

As video terminals began to replace printing ones, the value of the &quot;rubout&quot; character was lost. DEC systems, for example, interpreted &quot;Delete&quot; to mean &quot;remove the character before the cursor&quot; and this interpretation also became common in Unix systems. Most other systems used &quot;Backspace&quot; for that meaning and used &quot;Delete&quot; to mean &quot;remove the character at the cursor&quot;. That latter interpretation is the most common now.

Many more of the control codes have been given meanings quite different from their original ones. The &quot;escape&quot; character (ESC, code 27), for example, was intended originally to allow sending other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning. This is the same meaning of &quot;escape&quot; encountered in URL encodings, [[C (programming language)|C language]] strings, and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning. Over time this meaning has been co-opted and has eventually been changed. In modern use, an ESC sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence, usually in the form of a so-called &quot;[[ANSI escape code]]&quot; (or, more properly, a &quot;Control Sequence Introducer&quot;) beginning with ESC followed by a &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; (left-bracket) character. An ESC sent from the terminal is most often used as an [[out-of-band data|out-of-band]] character used to terminate an operation, as in the [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]] and [[vi]] [[text editor]]s. In [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) and [[window (computing)|windowing]] systems, ESC generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to [[exit (operating system)|exit]] (terminate) altogether.

The inherent ambiguity of many control characters, combined with their historical usage, created problems when transferring &quot;plain text&quot; files between systems. The best example of this is the [[newline]] problem on various [[operating system]]s. Teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both &quot;Carriage Return&quot; (which moves the printhead to the beginning of the line) and &quot;Line Feed&quot; (which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead). The name &quot;Carriage Return&quot; comes from the fact that on a manual [[typewriter]] the carriage holding the paper moved while the position where the typebars struck the ribbon remained stationary.  The entire carriage had to be pushed (returned) to the right in order to position the left margin of the paper for the next line.

[[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] operating systems ([[OS/8]], [[RT-11]], [[RSX-11]], [[RSTS/E|RSTS]], [[TOPS-10]], etc.) used both characters to mark the end of a line so that the console device (originally [[Teleprinter|Teletype machines]]) would work. By the time so-called &quot;glass TTYs&quot; (later called CRTs or terminals) came along, the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing the convention. When Gary Kildall cloned [[RT-11]] to create [[CP/M]] he followed established [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] convention.  Until the introduction of [[PC DOS]] in 1981, [[IBM]] had no hand in this because their 1970s operating systems used EBCDIC instead of ASCII and they were oriented toward punch-card input and line printer output on which the concept of &quot;carriage return&quot; was meaningless. IBM's [[PC DOS]] (also marketed as [[MS-DOS]] by Microsoft) inherited the convention by virtue of being a clone of [[CP/M]], and [[Windows]] inherited it from MS-DOS.

Unfortunately, requiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduces unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each character when encountered alone. To simplify matters [[plain text]] data streams, including files, on [[Multics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.multicians.org/jhs-jfo-terminals.pdf |title=Technical and human engineering problems in connecting terminals to a time-sharing system |last1=Ossanna |first1=J.

[[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] systems, and [[Amiga]] systems, adopted this convention from Multics. The original [[Macintosh OS]], [[Apple DOS]], and [[ProDOS]], on the other hand, used carriage return (CR) alone as a line terminator; however, since Apple replaced it with the Unix-based [[OS X]] operating system, they now use line feed (LF) as well.

Computers attached to the [[ARPANET]] included machines running operating systems such as TOPS-10 and [[TOPS-20#TENEX|TENEX]] using CR-LF line endings, machines running operating systems such as Multics using LF line endings, and machines running operating systems such as [[OS/360]] that represented lines as a character count followed by the characters of the line and that used [[EBCDIC]] rather than ASCII.  The [[Telnet]] protocol defined an ASCII &quot;Network Virtual Terminal&quot; (NVT), so that connections between hosts with different line-ending conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting a standard text format over the network; it used ASCII, along with CR-LF line endings, and software using other conventions would translate between the local conventions and the NVT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF|title=TELNET Protocol|rfc=158|pages=4-5|author=T. O'Sullivan|date=May 19, 1971|publisher =[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]|accessdate=2013-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[File Transfer Protocol]] adopted the Telnet protocol, including use of the Network Virtual Terminal, for use when transmitting commands and transferring data in the default ASCII mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF|title=File Transfer Protocol|rfc=542|author=Nancy J.

Older operating systems such as TOPS-10, along with CP/M, tracked file length only in units of disk blocks and used Control-Z (SUB) to mark the end of the actual text in the file.  For this reason, EOF, or [[end-of-file]], was used colloquially and conventionally as a [[three-letter acronym]] (TLA) for Control-Z instead of SUBstitute.  For a variety of reasons, the end-of-text code, [[End-of-text character|ETX]] aka [[Control-C]], was inappropriate and using Z as the control code to end a file is analogous to it ending the alphabet, a very convenient [[Mnemonic device|mnemonic aid]]. An historic common, and still prevalent, convention uses the [[End-of-text character|ETX]] aka [[Control-C]] code convention to interrupt and halt a program via an input data stream, usually from a keyboard.

In C library and [[Unix]] conventions, the [[null character]] is used to terminate text [[string (computer science)|string]]s; such [[null-terminated string]]s can be known in abbreviation as ASCIZ or ASCIIZ, where here Z stands for &quot;zero&quot;.

To delete the previous character, one had to back up the paper tape punch, which for mechanical and simplicity reasons was a button on the punch itself and not the keyboard, then type the rubout character. They therefore placed a key producing rubout at the location used on typewriters for backspace. When systems used these terminals and provided command-line editing, they had to use the &quot;rubout&quot; code to perform a backspace, and often did not interpret the backspace character (they might echo &quot;&lt;tt&gt;^H&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; for backspace). Other terminals not designed for paper tape made the key at this location produce Backspace, and systems designed for these used that character to back up. Since the delete code often produced a backspace effect, this also forced terminal manufacturers to make any {{keypress|Delete}} key produce something other than the Delete character.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Section header linked to from redirects --&gt;
Codes 20&lt;sub&gt;[[hexadecimal|hex]]&lt;/sub&gt; to 7E&lt;sub&gt;[[hexadecimal|hex]]&lt;/sub&gt;, known as the printable characters, represent letters, digits, [[punctuation marks]], and a few miscellaneous symbols. There are 95 printable characters in total.

Code 20&lt;sub&gt;[[hexadecimal|hex]]&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[Space (punctuation)|space character]], denotes the space between words, as produced by the space-bar of a keyboard. Since the space character is considered an invisible graphic (rather than a control character)&lt;ref name=&quot;FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980223&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RFC20_1968&quot; /&gt; and thus would not normally be visible, it is represented here by [[Unicode]] character U+2420 &quot;␠&quot;; Unicode characters U+2422 &quot;␢&quot; and U+2423 &quot;␣&quot; are also available for use when a visible representation of a space is necessary.

Code 7F&lt;sub&gt;[[hexadecimal|hex]]&lt;/sub&gt; corresponds to the non-printable &quot;Delete&quot; (DEL) control character and is therefore omitted from this chart; it is covered in the previous section's chart.

Earlier versions of ASCII used the up-arrow instead of the [[caret]] (5E&lt;sub&gt;[[hexadecimal|hex]]&lt;/sub&gt;) and the left-arrow instead of the [[underscore]] (5F&lt;sub&gt;[[hexadecimal|hex]]&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wps.com/projects/codes/X3.4-1963/index.html ASA X3.4-1963].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aliases==
A June 1992 RFC&lt;ref&gt;RFC 1345 (June 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] registry of character sets&lt;ref name=&quot;IANA&quot; /&gt; recognize the following case-insensitive aliases for ASCII as suitable for use on the Internet:&lt;div style=&quot;-moz-column-count:2; column-count:2;&quot;&gt;
* ANSI_X3.4-1968 (canonical name)
* iso-ir-6
* ANSI_X3.4-1986
* ISO_646.irv:1991
* ASCII
**(with ASCII-7 and ASCII-8 variants){{failed verification|date=September 2013}}
* ISO646-US
* US-ASCII (preferred [[MIME]] name)&lt;ref name=&quot;IANA&quot;&gt;Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (May 14, 2007). &quot;[http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets Character Sets]&quot;. Accessed 2008-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt;
* us
* IBM367
* cp367
* csASCII
&lt;/div&gt;

Of these, the IANA encourages use of the name &quot;US-ASCII&quot; for Internet uses of ASCII (even if it is a [[RAS syndrome|redundant acronym]], but the US is needed because of abuse of the ASCII term). One often finds this in the optional &quot;charset&quot; parameter in the Content-Type header of some MIME messages, in the equivalent &quot;meta&quot; element of some [[HTML]] documents, and in the encoding declaration part of the prologue of some [[XML]] documents.

==Variants==
As computer technology spread throughout the world, different [[Standardization|standards bodies]] and corporations developed many variations of ASCII to facilitate the expression of non-English languages that used Roman-based alphabets. One could class some of these variations as &quot;[[Extended ASCII|ASCII extensions]]&quot;, although some misuse that term to represent all variants, including those that do not preserve ASCII's character-map in the 7-bit range.

The [[PETSCII]] code [[Commodore International]] used for their [[8-bit]] systems is probably unique among post-1970 codes in being based on ASCII-1963, instead of the more common ASCII-1967, such as found on the [[ZX Spectrum character set|ZX Spectrum]] computer. [[ATASCII|Atari]] 8-bit computers and [[Galaksija (computer)#Character ROM|Galaksija]] computers also used ASCII variants.

===7-bit===
From early in its development,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Specific Criteria,&quot; attachment to memo from R. W. Reach, &quot;X3-2 Meeting – September 14 and 15,&quot; September 18, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; ASCII was intended to be just one of several national variants of an international character code standard, ultimately published as [[ISO/IEC 646]] (1972), which would share most characters in common but assign other locally useful characters to several [[code point]]s reserved for &quot;national use.&quot;  However, the four years that elapsed between the publication of ASCII-1963 and ISO's first acceptance of an international recommendation during 1967&lt;ref&gt;R. Maréchal, ISO/TC 97 – Computers and Information Processing: Acceptance of Draft ISO Recommendation No. 1052, December 22, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; caused ASCII's choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world, causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points.

ISO/IEC 646, like ASCII, was a 7-bit character set. It did not make any additional codes available, so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries. Escape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to a piece of text, but they were rarely used, so it was often impossible to know what variant to work with and therefore which character a code represented, and in general text-processing systems could cope with only one variant anyway.

Because the bracket and brace characters of ASCII were assigned to &quot;national use&quot; code points that were used for accented letters in other national variants of ISO/IEC 646, a German, French, or Swedish, etc. programmer using their national variant of ISO/IEC 646, rather than ASCII, had to write, and thus read, something such as
:&lt;code&gt;ä aÄiÜ='Ön'; ü&lt;/code&gt;
instead of
:&lt;code&gt;{ a[i]='\n'; }&lt;/code&gt;
[[C trigraph]]s were created to solve this problem for [[ANSI C]], although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use. Many programmers kept their computers on US-ASCII, instead plain-text in Swedish, German etc. (e.g. in e-mail, [[Usenet]]) contained {, } and more in the middle of words, something those programmers got used to.

===8-bit===
Eventually, as 8-, [[16-bit|16-]] and [[32-bit]] (and later [[64-bit]]) computers began to replace [[18-bit|18-]] and [[36-bit]] computers as the norm, it became common to use an 8-bit byte to store each character in memory, providing an opportunity for extended, 8-bit, relatives of ASCII. In most cases these developed as true extensions of ASCII, leaving the original character-mapping intact, but adding additional character definitions after the first 128 (i.e., 7-bit) characters.

Most early home computer systems developed their own 8-bit character sets containing line-drawing and game glyphs, and often filled in some or all of the control characters from 0-31 with more graphics. The IBM PC defined [[code page 437]], which replaced the control-characters with graphic symbols such as [[Emoticon|smiley faces]], and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper 128 positions. Operating systems such as [[DOS]] supported these code-pages, and manufacturers of [[IBM PC]]s supported them in hardware. [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] developed the [[Multinational Character Set]] (DEC-MCS) for use in the popular [[VT220]] [[computer terminal|terminal]], this was one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics. The Macintosh defined [[Mac OS Roman]] and Postscript also defined a set, both of these contained both international letters and typographic punctuation marks instead of graphics, more like modern character sets. The [[ISO/IEC 8859]] standard (derived from the DEC-MCS) finally provided a standard that most systems copied (at least as accurately as they copied ASCII, but with many substitutions). A popular further extension designed by Microsoft, [[Windows-1252]] (often mislabeled as ISO-8859-1), added the typographic punctuation marks needed for traditional text printing.

ISO-8859-1, Windows-1252, and the original 7-bit ASCII were the most common character encodings until the late 2000s, when [[UTF-8]] became more common.&lt;ref name=&quot;utf-8-2008&quot; /&gt;

===Unicode===
[[Unicode]] and the ISO/IEC 10646 [[Universal Character Set]] (UCS) have a much wider array of characters, and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant ISO/IEC 8859 and ASCII rapidly in many environments. While ASCII is limited to 128 characters, Unicode and the UCS support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification (using [[natural number]]s called ''code points'') and encoding (to 8-, 16- or 32-bit binary formats, called [[UTF-8]], [[UTF-16]] and [[UTF-32]]).

To allow backward compatibility, the 128 ASCII and 256 ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1) characters are assigned Unicode/UCS code points that are the same as their codes in the earlier standards. Therefore, ASCII can be considered a 7-bit encoding scheme for a very small subset of Unicode/UCS, and ASCII (when prefixed with 0 as the eighth bit) is valid UTF-8.

==Order==
ASCII-code order is also called ''ASCIIbetical'' order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=ASCIIbetical&amp;i=38025,00.asp |title=ASCIIbetical definition |magazine=[[PC Magazine]] |accessdate=2008-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Collation]] of data is sometimes done in this order rather than &quot;standard&quot; alphabetical order ([[collating sequence]]). The main deviations in ASCII order are:

* All uppercase come before lowercase letters, for example, &quot;Z&quot; before &quot;a&quot;
* Digits and many punctuation marks come before letters; for example, &quot;4&quot; precedes &quot;one&quot;
* Numbers are sorted naïvely as strings; for example, &quot;10&quot; precedes &quot;2&quot;

An intermediate order—readily implemented—converts uppercase letters to lowercase before comparing ASCII values. Naïve number sorting can be averted by [[Leading zero|zero-filling]] all numbers (e.g. &quot;02&quot; will sort before &quot;10&quot; as expected), although this is an external fix and has nothing to do with the ordering itself.

'''Animation''' is the process of creating a continuous [[Motion (physics)|motion]] and shape change{{#tag:ref|With the &quot;[[squash and stretch]]&quot; principle often applied in case of [[character animation]].|group=Note}} [[illusion]] by means of the rapid display of a sequence of static images that minimally differ from each other. The illusion&amp;mdash;as in motion pictures in general&amp;mdash;is thought to rely on the [[phi phenomenon]].

&lt;div class=&quot;thumbcaption&quot;&gt;This animation moves at 10 frames per second.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Animations can be [[Recording|recorded]] on either analogue media, such as a [[flip book]], [[motion picture film]], video tape, or on [[digital media]], including formats such as [[animated GIF]], [[Flash animation]] or digital video. To display it, a [[digital camera]], computer, or [[Image projector|projector]] are used.

Animation creation methods include the [[traditional animation]] creation method and those involving [[stop motion animation]] of two and three-dimensional objects, such as [[cutout animation|paper cutouts]], [[puppets]] and [[Clay animation|clay figures]]. Images are displayed in a rapid succession, usually 24, 25, or 30 frames per second.

== Etymology ==
From Latin ''animātiō'', &quot;the act of bringing to life&quot;; from ''animō'' (&quot;to animate&quot; or &quot;give life to&quot;) and ''-ātiō'' (&quot;the act of&quot;).{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

== History ==
{{Main|History of animation}}

[[Image:Phenakistoscope 3g07690u.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A phenakistoscope disc by [[Eadweard Muybridge]] (1893)]]
Early examples of attempts to capture the phenomenon of [[motion (physics)|motion]] into a still drawing can be found in [[paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s, where animals are often depicted with multiple legs in superimposed positions, clearly attempting to convey the perception of motion.

A Chinese [[zoetrope]]-type device had been invented in 180&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ronan | first = Colin A | author2 = Joseph Needham | year = 1985 | title = The Shorter Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 2 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn = 978-0-521-31536-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Voynich manuscript]] that dates back to between 1404 and 1438 contains several series of illustrations of the same subject-matter and even few circles that – when spun around the center – would create an illusion of motion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgALlSPlZC8&lt;/ref&gt;

These devices produced the appearance of movement from sequential drawings using technological means, but animation did not really develop much further until the advent of [[cinematography]]. The [[cinématographe]] was a projector, printer, and camera in one machine that allowed moving pictures to be shown successfully on a screen which was invented by history's earliest film makers, [[Auguste and Louis Lumière]], in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McLaughlin|first=Dan|title=A RATHER INCOMPLETE BUT STILL FASCINATING|url=http://animation.filmtv.ucla.edu/NewSite/WebPages/Histories.html|work=Film Tv|publisher=UCLA|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[phenakistoscope]] (1832), [[zoetrope]] (1834) and [[praxinoscope]] (1877), as well as the common [[flip book]], were early animation devices to produce movement from sequential drawings using technological means, but animation did not develop further until the advent of [[film|motion picture film]].

The first animated projection (screening) was created in France, by [[Charles-Émile Reynaud]], who was a French science teacher. Reynaud created the [[Praxinoscope]] in 1877 and the Théâtre Optique in December 1888. On 28 October 1892, he projected the first animation in public, ''[[Pauvre Pierrot]]'', at the Musée Grévin in Paris. This film is also notable as the first known instance of film perforations being used. His films were not photographed, but drawn directly onto the transparent strip. In 1900, more than 500,000 people had attended these screenings.

[[File:Lanature1882 praxinoscope projection reynaud.png|thumb|Praxinoscope, The first projection (1877)]]

The first film that was recorded on [[standard picture film]] and included animated sequences was the 1900 [[The Enchanted Drawing|Enchanted Drawing]], which was followed by the first entirely animated film - the 1906 ''[[Humorous Phases of Funny Faces]]'' by [[J. Stuart Blackton]], who, because of that, is considered the father of American animation.

[[File:Fantasmagorie (Cohl).GIF|thumb|The first animated film created by using what came to be known as [[traditional animation|traditional (hand-drawn) animation]] - the 1908 ''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' by [[Émile Cohl]]]]

In Europe, the French artist, [[Émile Cohl]], created the first animated film using what came to be known as [[traditional animation]] creation methods - the 1908 ''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]''. The film largely consisted of a [[stick figure]] moving about and encountering all manner of morphing objects, such as a wine bottle that transforms into a flower. There were also sections of live action in which the animator’s hands would enter the scene. The film was created by drawing each frame on paper and then shooting each frame onto [[negative film]], which gave the picture a blackboard look.

The author of the first [[puppet]]-animated film (''The Beautiful Lukanida'' (1912)) was the Russian-born (ethnically [[Poles|Polish]]) director Wladyslaw Starewicz, known as [[Ladislas Starevich]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The more detailed hand-drawn animations, requiring a team of animators drawing each frame manually with detailed backgrounds and characters, were those directed by [[Winsor McCay]], a successful newspaper cartoonist, including the 1911 ''[[Little Nemo]]'', the 1914 ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]'', and the 1918 ''[[The Sinking of the Lusitania]]''.

During the 1910s, the production of animated short films, typically referred to as &quot;cartoons&quot;, became an industry of its own and cartoon shorts were produced for showing in movie theaters. The most successful producer at the time was [[John Randolph Bray]], who, along with [[animator]] [[Earl Hurd]], patented the [[Traditional animation#Cels|cel animation]] process which dominated the animation industry for the rest of the decade.

''[[El Apóstol]]'' (Spanish: &quot;The Apostle&quot;) was a 1917 Argentine animated film utilizing cutout animation, and the world's first animated feature film.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/93678-El_Apostol.html El Apóstol]&quot;. ''www.bcdb.com'', 4 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, a fire that destroyed producer Frederico Valle's film studio incinerated the only known copy of ''El Apóstol'', and it is now considered a [[lost film]].

[[Computer animation]] has become popular since ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995), the first animated film completely made using this technique.

In 2008, the animation market was worth US$68.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boi.gov.ph/pdf/valuepropositions/Animation/Animation.pdf |title=Animation |date=November 2009|accessdate= 24 July 2012|work= boi.gov.ph|publisher= Board of Investments}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==

=== Traditional animation ===
{{Main|Traditional animation}}
[[File:Animhorse.gif|thumb|right|200px|An example of traditional animation, a horse animated by [[rotoscoping]] from [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s 19th century photos]]
'''Traditional animation''' (also called cel animation or hand-drawn animation) was the process used for most animated films of the 20th century. The individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings, first drawn on paper. To create the illusion of movement, each drawing differs slightly from the one before it. The animators' drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called [[cel]]s, which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings. The completed character cels are photographed one-by-one against a painted background by a [[rostrum camera]] onto motion picture film.

The traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the 21st century. Today, animators' drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system. Various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects. The final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media, including traditional [[35&amp;nbsp;mm film]] and newer media such as [[digital video]]. The &quot;look&quot; of traditional cel animation is still preserved, and the [[character animator]]s' work has remained essentially the same over the past 70 years. Some animation producers have used the term &quot;tradigital&quot; to describe cel animation which makes extensive use of computer technology.

[[File:Animated GIF from the 1919 Feline folies by Pat Sullivan.gif|thumb|250px|right|Excerpt from the 1919 ''Feline Follies'' with [[Felix the Cat]].]]
Examples of traditionally animated feature films include ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (United States, 1940), ''[[Animal Farm (1954 film)|Animal Farm]]'' (United Kingdom, 1954), and [[The Illusionist (2010 film)|L'Illusionniste]] (British-French, 2010). Traditional animated films which were produced with the aid of computer technology include ''[[The Lion King]]'' (US, 1994), ''[[Akira (film)|Akira]]'' (Japan, 1988), ''[[Spirited Away|Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi (Spirited Away)]]'' (Japan, 2001), ''[[Les Triplettes de Belleville]]'' (France, 2003), and ''[[The Secret of Kells]]'' (Irish-French-Belgian, 2009).

* '''Full animation''' refers to the process of producing high-quality traditionally animated films that regularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement. Fully animated films can be made in a variety of styles, from more realistically animated works such as those produced by the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney studio]] (''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', ''[[The Lion King|Lion King]]'') to the more 'cartoon' styles of the [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Warner Bros. animation studio]]. Many of the [[Disney animated features]] are examples of full animation, as are non-Disney works such as ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]'' (US, 1982), ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' (US, 1999), and ''[[Nocturna (Film)|Nocturna]]'' (Spain, 2007).
* '''[[Limited animation]]''' involves the use of less detailed and/or more stylized drawings and methods of movement. Pioneered by the artists at the American studio [[United Productions of America]], limited animation can be used as a method of stylized artistic expression, as in ''[[Gerald McBoing Boing]]'' (US, 1951), ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' (UK, 1968), and much of the [[anime]] produced in Japan. Its primary use, however, has been in producing cost-effective animated content for media such as television (the work of [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Filmation]], and other TV animation studios) and later [[the Internet]] ([[web cartoon]]s).
* '''[[Rotoscoping]]''' is a technique patented by [[Max Fleischer]] in 1917 where animators trace live-action movement, [[frame (film)|frame]] by frame. The source film can be directly copied from actors' outlines into animated drawings, as in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' (US, 1978), or used in a stylized and expressive manner, as in ''[[Waking Life]]'' (US, 2001) and ''[[A Scanner Darkly (film)|A Scanner Darkly]]'' (US, 2006). Some other examples are: ''[[Fire and Ice (1983 film)|Fire and Ice]]'' (US, 1983) and ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'' (1981).
* '''[[Films with live action and animation|Live-action/animation]]''' is a technique combining hand-drawn characters into live action shots. One of the earlier uses was in [[Koko the Clown]] when Koko was drawn over live action footage. Other examples include ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (US, 1988), ''[[Space Jam]]'' (US, 1996) and ''[[Osmosis Jones]]'' (US, 2001).

=== Stop motion animation ===
{{Main|Stop motion}}

'''Stop-motion animation''' is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating real-world objects and photographing them one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement. There are many different types of stop-motion animation, usually named after the medium used to create the animation. Computer software is widely available to create this type of animation; however, traditional stop motion animation is usually less expensive and time-consuming to produce than current computer animation.

* '''[[Puppet animation]]''' typically involves stop-motion puppet figures interacting in a constructed environment, in contrast to real-world interaction in model animation. The puppets generally have an [[armature (sculpture)|armature]] inside of them to keep them still and steady as well as to constrain their motion to particular joints. Examples include ''[[The Tale of the Fox]]'' (France, 1937), ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (US, 1993), ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' (US, 2005), ''[[Coraline (film)|Coraline]]'' (US, 2009), the films of [[Jiří Trnka]] and the TV series ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' (US, 2005–present).
** '''[[Puppetoon]]''', created using techniques developed by [[George Pal]], are puppet-animated films which typically use a different version of a puppet for different frames, rather than simply manipulating one existing puppet. [[File:Animacion-con-plastilina-y-clay-animation-pelicula-Kuzmich-153.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Clay animation]]]]
* '''[[Clay animation]]''', or [[Plasticine]] animation (often called ''claymation'', which, however, is a [[Laika (company)|trademark]]ed name), uses figures made of clay or a similar malleable material to create stop-motion animation. The figures may have an [[armature (sculpture)|armature]] or wire frame inside, similar to the related puppet animation (below), that can be manipulated to pose the figures. Alternatively, the figures may be made entirely of clay, such as in the films of [[Bruce Bickford (animator)|Bruce Bickford]], where clay creatures morph into a variety of different shapes. Examples of clay-animated works include ''[[Gumby|The Gumby Show]]'' (US, 1957–1967) ''[[Morph (character)|Morph]]'' shorts (UK, 1977–2000), ''[[Wallace and Gromit]]'' shorts (UK, as of 1989), [[Jan Švankmajer]]'s ''[[Dimensions of Dialogue]]'' ([[Czechoslovakia]], 1982), ''[[The Trap Door]]'' (UK, 1984). Films include ''[[Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'', ''[[Chicken Run]]'' and ''[[The Adventures of Mark Twain (1985 film)|The Adventures of Mark Twain]]''.
* '''[[Cutout animation]]''' is a type of stop-motion animation produced by moving two-dimensional pieces of material such as paper or cloth. Examples include [[Terry Gilliam]]'s animated sequences from ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' (UK, 1969–1974); ''[[Fantastic Planet]]'' (France/Czechoslovakia, 1973) ; ''[[Tale of Tales (film)|Tale of Tales]]'' (Russia, 1979), The pilot episode of the TV series (and sometimes in episodes) of ''[[South Park]]'' (US, 1997). [[File:Claychick.jpg|thumb|225px|left|A clay animation scene from a [[Finland|Finnish]] television commercial]]
** '''[[Silhouette animation]]''' is a variant of cutout animation in which the characters are backlit and only visible as silhouettes. Examples include ''[[The Adventures of Prince Achmed]]'' ([[Weimar Republic]], 1926) and ''[[Ciné si|Princes et princesses]]'' (France, 2000).
* '''[[Model animation]]''' refers to stop-motion animation created to interact with and exist as a part of a live-action world. Intercutting, [[matte (filmmaking)|matte]] effects, and split screens are often employed to blend stop-motion characters or objects with live actors and settings. Examples include the work of [[Ray Harryhausen]], as seen in films such ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'' (1963), and the work of [[Willis O'Brien]] on films such as ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933 film).
** '''[[Go motion]]''' is a variant of model animation that uses various techniques to create  [[motion blur]] between frames of film, which is not present in traditional stop-motion. The technique was invented by [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] and [[Phil Tippett]] to create [[special effects]] scenes for the film ''[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back|The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980). Another example is the dragon named &quot;Vermithrax&quot; from ''[[Dragonslayer]]'' (1981 film).
* '''[[Object animation]]''' refers to the use of regular inanimate objects in stop-motion animation, as opposed to specially created items.
** '''[[Graphic animation]]''' uses non-drawn flat visual graphic material (photographs, newspaper clippings, magazines, etc.), which are sometimes manipulated frame-by-frame to create movement. At other times, the graphics remain stationary, while the stop-motion camera is moved to create on-screen action.
** '''[[Brickfilm]]''' A sub-genre of object animation involving using [[Lego]] or other similar brick toys to make an animation. These have had a recent boost in popularity with the advent of video sharing sites like YouTube and the availability of cheap cameras and animation software.
* '''[[Pixilation]]''' involves the use of live humans as stop motion characters. This allows for a number of surreal effects, including disappearances and reappearances, allowing people to appear to slide across the ground, and other such effects. Examples of pixilation include ''[[The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb]]'' and ''[[Angry Kid]]'' shorts.

=== Computer animation ===
{{Main|Computer animation}}
'''Computer animation''' encompasses a variety of techniques, the unifying factor being that the animation is created digitally on a computer. 2D animation techniques tend to focus on image manipulation while 3D techniques usually build virtual worlds in which characters and objects move and interact. 3D animation can create images that seem real to the viewer.

[[File:Animation-W.gif|thumb|132x132px]]

[[2D computer graphics|2D animation]] figures are created and/or edited on the computer using 2D [[bitmap graphics]] or created and edited using 2D [[vector graphics]]. This includes automated computerized versions of traditional animation techniques such as [[interpolated]] [[morphing]], [[onion skinning]] and [[interpolated]] rotoscoping.
2D animation has many applications, including [[Scanimate|analog computer animation]], [[Flash animation]] and [[PowerPoint animation]]. [[Cinemagraph]]s are [[still photograph]]s in the form of an [[animated GIF]] file of which part is animated.

Here, folds in the fabric, hair silhouettes and the like come from of the committed design decision-making that comes with the 2D drawn process. Our animators can change things, actually erase away the CG underlayer if they want, and change the profile of the arm. And they can design all the fabric in that [[Milt Kahl]] kind-of way, if they want to.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cartoonbrew.com/cgi/a-little-more-about-disneys-paperman-63782.html A Little More About Disney’s “Paperman”]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== 3D animation ====
{{Main|Computer animation|3D computer graphics}}
3D animation is digitally modeled and manipulated by an animator. The animator starts by creating an external 3D mesh to manipulate. A mesh is a geometric configuration that gives the visual appearance of form to a 3D object or 3D environment. The mesh may have many vertices which are the geometric points which make up the mesh; it is given an internal digital skeletal structure called an armature that can be used to control the mesh with weights. This process is called rigging and can be programmed for movement with keyframes.

Other techniques can be applied, such as mathematical functions (e.g., gravity, particle simulations), simulated fur or hair, and effects such as fire and water simulations. These techniques fall under the category of 3D dynamics.

===== 3D Terms =====
* '''[[Cel-shaded animation]]''' is used to mimic traditional animation using CG software. Shading looks stark, with less blending of colors. Examples include, ''[[Skyland]]'' (2007, France), ''[[Appleseed Ex Machina]]'' (2007, Japan), ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker]]'' (2002, Japan)
* '''[[Machinima]]''' – Films created by screen capturing in video games and virtual worlds.
* '''[[Motion capture]]''' is used when live-action actors wear special suits that allow computers to copy their movements into CG characters. Examples include ''[[Polar Express]]'' (2004, US), ''[[Beowulf (2007 film)|Beowulf]]'' (2007, US), ''[[A Christmas Carol (2009 film)|A Christmas Carol]]'' (2009, US), ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (film)|The Adventures of Tintin]]'' (2011, US)
* '''[[Computer animation|Photo-realistic animation]]''' is used primarily for animation that attempts to resemble real life, using advanced rendering that mimics in detail skin, plants, water, fire, clouds, etc. Examples include ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' (2009, US), ''[[Kung-Fu Panda]]'' (2008, US), ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'' (2002, US).

=== Mechanical animation ===
[[File:Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln.jpg|thumb|left|Audio-Animatronic version of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln.]]
* '''[[Animatronics]]''' is the use of [[mechatronics]] to create machines which seem animate rather than robotic.
** '''[[Audio-Animatronics|Audio-Animatronics and Autonomatronics]]''' is a form of [[robotic]]s animation, combined with 3-D animation, created by [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] for shows and attractions at Disney theme parks move and make noise (generally a recorded speech or song), but are fixed to whatever supports them. They can sit and stand but cannot walk. An Audio-Animatron is different from an [[android (robot)|android]]-type robot in that it uses prerecorded movements and sounds, rather than responding to external stimuli. In 2009, Disney created an interactive version of the technology called Autonomatronics.
** '''Linear Animation Generator''' is a form of animation by using static picture frames installed in a tunnel or a shaft. The animation illusion is created by putting the viewer in a linear motion, parallel to the installed picture frames. The concept and the technical solution, were invented in 2007 by Mihai Girlovan in Romania.
* '''[[Chuckimation]]''' is a type of animation created by the makers of the cartoon ''[[Action League Now!]]'' in which characters/props are thrown, or chucked from off camera or wiggled around to simulate talking by unseen hands,
* '''[[Puppetry]]''' is a form of theatre or performance animation that involves the manipulation of puppets. It is very ancient, and is believed to have originated 3000 years BC.[1] Puppetry takes many forms but they all share the process of animating inanimate performing objects. Puppetry is used in almost all human societies both as entertainment – in performance – and ceremonially in rituals and celebrations such as carnivals. Most puppetry involves storytelling.

[[File:Toy Story Zoetrope, Disney California Adventure 2.jpg|thumb|''[[Toy Story]]'' zoetrope at [[Disney California Adventure]] creates illusion of motion using figures, rather than static pictures.]]
* '''[[Zoetrope]]''' is a device that produces the illusion of motion from a rapid succession of static pictures. The term zoetrope is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ζωή (''zoē''), meaning &quot;alive, active&quot;, and τρόπος (''tropos''), meaning &quot;turn&quot;, with &quot;zoetrope&quot; taken to mean &quot;active turn&quot; or &quot;wheel of life&quot;.

=== Other animation styles, techniques and approaches ===
* '''[[Drawn on film animation]]''': a technique where footage is produced by creating the images directly on [[film stock]], for example by [[Norman McLaren]], [[Len Lye]] and [[Stan Brakhage]].
* '''[[Paint-on-glass animation]]''': a technique for making animated films by manipulating slow drying [[oil paint]]s on sheets of glass, for example by [[Aleksandr Petrov (animator)|Aleksandr Petrov]].
* '''Erasure animation''': a technique using traditional 2D media, photographed over time as the artist manipulates the image. For example, [[William Kentridge]] is famous for his [[charcoal]] erasure films, and [[Piotr Dumała]] for his auteur technique of animating scratches on plaster.
* '''[[Pinscreen animation]]''': makes use of a screen filled with movable pins that can be moved in or out by pressing an object onto the screen. The screen is lit from the side so that the pins cast shadows. The technique has been used to create animated films with a range of textural effects difficult to achieve with traditional cel animation.
* '''[[Sand animation]]''': sand is moved around on a back- or front-lighted piece of glass to create each frame for an animated film. This creates an interesting effect when animated because of the [[light]] [[Contrast (vision)|contrast]].
* '''[[Flip book]]''': a flip book (sometimes, especially in British English, called a flick book) is a book with a series of pictures that vary gradually from one page to the next, so that when the pages are turned rapidly, the pictures appear to animate by simulating motion or some other change. Flip books are often illustrated books for children, but may also be geared towards adults and employ a series of photographs rather than drawings. Flip books are not always separate books, but may appear as an added feature in ordinary books or magazines, often in the page corners. Software packages and websites are also available that convert digital video files into custom-made flip books.
* '''[[Character animation]]'''
* '''[[Multi-sketch]]ing'''
* '''[[Special effects animation]]'''

==Awards==
As with any other form of media, animation too has instituted awards for excellence in the field. The original awards for animation were presented by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] for animated shorts from the year 1932, during the 5th [[Academy Awards]] function. The first winner of the [[Academy Award]] was the short [[Flowers and Trees]], a production by [[Walt Disney Productions]] and [[United Artists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemayavideotutorials.com/what-is-new/flowers-and-trees-1932-ist-oscar-award-winner-3d-animation-movie.html Flowers And Trees [1932&amp;#93;, Ist Oscar Award Winner 3D Animation Movie | Free Maya Video Tutorials&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Academy Award for a feature length animated motion picture was only instituted for the year 2001, and awarded during the 74th Academy Awards in 2002. It was won by the movie [[Shrek]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0126029/awards Shrek (2001) - Awards&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; produced by [[DreamWorks]] and [[Pacific Data Images]]. Since then, Disney/Pixar have produced the most movies either to win or be nominated for the award. The list of both awards can be obtained here:
*[[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]]
*[[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]]

Several other countries have instituted an award for best animated feature film as part of their national film awards: [[BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2006), [[César Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2011), [[Goya Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 1989), [[Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year]] (since 2007). Also since 2007, the [[Asia Pacific Screen Award for Best Animated Feature Film]] has been awarded at the [[Asia Pacific Screen Awards]]. Since 2009, the [[European Film Awards]] have awarded the [[European Film Award for Best Animated Film]].
 
The [[Annie Award]] is another award presented for excellence in the field of animation. Unlike the Academy Awards, the Annie Awards are only received for achievements in the field of animation and not for any other field of technical and artistic endeavor. They were re-organized in 1992 to create a new field for Best Animated feature. The 1990s winners were dominated by Walt Disney, however newer studios, led by Pixar &amp; DreamWorks, have now begun to consistently vie for this award. The list of awardees is as follows: 
*[[Annie Award for Best Animated Feature]]

{{Ancient Greek religion}}

'''Apollo''' ([[Attic Greek|Attic]], [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]], and [[Homeric Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀπόλλων}}, ''Apollōn'' (&lt;small&gt;[[Genitive|GEN]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|grc|Ἀπόλλωνος}}); [[Doric Greek|Doric]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀπέλλων}}, ''Apellōn''; [[Arcadocypriot Greek|Arcadocypriot]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀπείλων}}, ''Apeilōn''; [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolic]]: {{lang|grc|Ἄπλουν}}, ''Aploun''; {{lang-la|Apollō}}) is one of the most important and complex of the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian deities]] in [[Ancient Greek religion|classical Greek]] and [[Ancient Roman religion|Roman religion]] and [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]]. The ideal of the ''[[kouros]]'' (a beardless, athletic youth), Apollo has been variously recognized as a god of light and the sun, truth and prophecy, healing, plague, music, poetry, and more. Apollo is the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Leto]], and has a twin sister, the chaste huntress [[Artemis]]. Apollo is known in Greek-influenced [[Etruscan mythology]] as ''Apulu''.

As the patron of [[Delphi]] (''Pythian Apollo''), Apollo was an [[oracular]] god—the prophetic deity of the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]]. Medicine and healing are associated with Apollo, whether through the god himself or mediated through his son [[Asclepius]], yet Apollo was also seen as a god who could bring ill-health and deadly [[Plague (disease)|plague]]. Amongst the god's custodial charges, Apollo became associated with dominion over [[Colonies in antiquity|colonists]], and as the patron defender of herds and flocks. As the leader of the [[Muse]]s (''Apollon Musegetes'') and director of their choir, Apollo functioned as the patron god of music and poetry. [[Hermes]] created the [[lyre]] for him, and the instrument became a common [[Apollo#Attributes and symbols|attribute of Apollo]]. Hymns sung to Apollo were called [[paean]]s.

In Hellenistic times, especially during the 3rd century BCE, as ''Apollo Helios'' he became identified among Greeks with [[Helios]], [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[solar deity|god of the sun]], and his sister Artemis similarly equated with [[Selene]], Titan [[lunar deity|goddess of the moon]].&lt;ref&gt;For the iconography of the Alexander–Helios type, see H. Hoffmann, 1963. &quot;Helios&quot;, in ''Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt'' '''2''', pp. 117–23; cf. Yalouris 1980, no. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In Latin texts, on the other hand, [[Joseph Fontenrose]] declared himself unable to find any conflation of Apollo with [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]] among the [[Classical Latin|Augustan poets]] of the 1st century, not even in the conjurations of [[Aeneas]] and [[Latinus]] in ''[[Aeneid]]'' XII (161–215).&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Fontenrose, &quot;Apollo and Sol in the Latin poets of the first century BC&quot;, ''Transactions of the American Philological Association'' '''30''' (1939), pp 439–55; &quot;Apollo and the Sun-God in Ovid&quot;, ''American Journal of Philology'' '''61''' (1940) pp 429–44; and &quot;Apollo and Sol in the Oaths of Aeneas and Latinus&quot; ''Classical Philology'' '''38'''.2 (April 1943), pp. 137–138.&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo and Helios/Sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the 3rd century CE.

==Etymology==

[[File:Tetradrachme de la région Illyro Péonienne.jpg|thumb|left|Tetradrachm from the Illyro-Paeonian region, representing Apollo]]

The etymology of ''Apollo'' is uncertain. The spelling Ἀπόλλων had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the common era, but the Doric form Απέλλων is more archaic, derived from an earlier {{lang|grc|*Ἀπέλjων}}. The name is certainly cognate with the Doric month name Ἀπέλλαιος and the Doric festival {{lang|grc|[[Apella|απελλαι]]}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;DDD&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=van der Toorn |first1=Karel |last2=Becking |first2=Bob |last3=van der Horst |first3=Pieter Willem |title=Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible |url=http://books.google.com/?id=PHgUAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA73 |year=1999 |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-90-04-11119-6 |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=March 2014|reason=Please explain how or why the linked to entity, i.e. the Spartan Assembly, is described as or connected to a festival or rephrase. Please also put proper accent and spiritus onto Greek word; is it the same as the ones on the Spartan Assembly (in Greek)?}}

Several instances of [[popular etymology]] are attested from ancient authors. Thus, the Greeks most often associated Apollo's name with the Greek verb {{lang|grc|ἀπόλλυμι}} (''apollymi''), &quot;to destroy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mike Campbell |url=http://www.behindthename.com/php/view.php?name=apollo |title=Meaning, Origin and History of the Name Apollo |publisher=Behind the Name |accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] in ''[[Cratylus]]'' connects the name with {{lang|grc|ἀπόλυσις}} (''apolysis''), &quot;redeem&quot;, with {{lang|grc|ἀπόλουσις}} (''apolousis''), &quot;purification&quot;, and with {{lang|grc|ἁπλοῦν}} (''[h]aploun''), &quot;simple&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;The {{lang|grc|ἁπλοῦν}} suggestion is repeated by [[Plutarch]] in ''[[Moralia]]'' in the sense of &quot;[[1 (number)|unity]]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; in particular in reference to the Thessalian form of the name, {{lang|grc|Ἄπλουν}}, and finally with {{lang|grc|Ἀειβάλλων}} (''aeiballon''), &quot;ever-shooting&quot;. [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]] connects the name Apollo with the Doric {{lang|grc|ἀπέλλα}} (''apella''), which means &quot;assembly&quot;, so that Apollo would be the god of political life, and he also gives the explanation {{lang|grc|σηκός}} (''sekos''), &quot;fold&quot;, in which case Apollo would be the god of flocks and herds.

Following the tradition of these Ancient Greek folk etymologies, in the Doric dialect the word {{lang|grc|ἀπέλλα}} originally meant wall, fence from animals and later assembly within the ''[[agora]]''.{{cn|date=March 2014}} In the [[Ancient Macedonian language]] {{lang|grc|πέλλα}} (''pella'') means stone, and some [[toponyms]] are derived from this word: {{lang|grc|Πέλλα}} ([[Pella]]:capital of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Ancient Macedonia]]), {{lang|grc|Πελλήνη}} (''Pellene''-''[[Pallini|Pallene]]'').&lt;!--eta = long e in English; really should be transliterated as Pellēne; EDIT(March 2014): Done--&gt;

A number of non-Greek etymologies have been suggested for the name,&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson, ''Die Geschichte der Griechische Religion'', vol. I (C.H. Beck) 1955:555-564.&lt;/ref&gt; The form ''[[Apaliunas]]'' (''&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;{{lang|hit-Latn|x-ap-pa-li-u-na-aš}}'') is attested as a god of [[Wilusa]],&lt;ref&gt;The reading of ''Apaliunas'' and the possible identification with Apollo is due to [[Emil Forrer]] (1931). It was doubted by [[Paul Kretschmer|Kretschmer]], Glotta XXIV p.250.Martin Nilsson (1967) Vol I p.559&lt;/ref&gt; which is the city of [[Troy]], in a treaty between [[Alaksandu]] of Wilusa and the [[Hittites|Hittite]] great king [[Muwatalli II]] c. 1280 BCE. ''Alaksandu'' could be [[Paris (mythology)|Paris-Alexander]] of [[Troy|Ilion]],&lt;ref&gt;Latacz, Joachim, ''Troia und Homer: Der Weg zur Lösung eines alten Rätsels.'' (Munich) 2001:138.&lt;/ref&gt; whose name is Greek.&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)le/candros|ἀλέξανδρος|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hittite language|Hittite]] testimony reflects an early form ''{{lang|grc-Latin|*Apeljōn}}'', which may also be surmised from comparison of Cypriot {{lang|grc|Ἀπείλων}} with Doric {{lang|grc|Ἀπέλλων}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Angel |first1=John L. |last2=Mellink |first2=Machteld Johanna | title = Troy and the Trojan War: A Symposium Held at Bryn Mawr College, October 1984| year = 1986| publisher = Bryn Mawr Commentaries| isbn = 978-0-929524-59-7| page = 42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Luwian language|Luwian]] etymology suggested for ''Apaliunas'' makes Apollo &quot;The One of Entrapment&quot;, perhaps in the sense of &quot;Hunter&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Immerwahr |first1=Sara Anderson |last2=Chapin |first2=Anne Proctor | title = Charis: Essays in Honor of Sara A. Immerwahr| year = 2004| publisher = Amer School of Classical| isbn = 978-0-87661-533-1| page = 254 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the proposed etymologies is the [[Hurrian]] and Hittite divinity, ''Aplu'', who was widely invoked during the &quot;plague years&quot;. Aplu, it is suggested, comes from the [[Akkadian]] ''Aplu Enlil'', meaning &quot;the son of Enlil&quot;, a title that was given to the god [[Nergal]], who was linked to [[Shamash]], Babylonian god of the sun.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grummond&quot;&gt;de Grummond, Nancy Thomson (2006) ''Etruscan Myth, Sacred History, and Legend''. (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology); Mackenzie, Donald A. (2005) ''Myths of Babylonia and Assyria'' (Gutenberg)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greco-Roman epithets===
Apollo, like other Greek deities, had a number of [[epithet]]s applied to him, reflecting the variety of roles, duties, and aspects ascribed to the god. However, while Apollo has a great number of appellations in Greek myth, only a few occur in [[Latin literature]], chief among them '''Phoebus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|iː|b|ə|s}} {{respell|FEE|bəs}}; {{lang|grc|Φοῖβος}}, ''Phoibos'', literally &quot;radiant&quot;), which was very commonly used by both the Greeks and Romans in Apollo's role as the god of light.

As sun-god and god of light, Apollo was also known by the epithets '''Aegletes''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|ɡ|l|iː|t|iː|z}} {{respell|ə|GLEE|teez}}; Αἰγλήτης, ''Aiglētēs'', from {{lang|grc|αἴγλη}}, &quot;light of the sun&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;[[Apollonius of Rhodes]], iv. 1730;'' Pseudo-Apollodorus, [[Bibliotheke|Biblioteca]]'', i. 9. § 26&lt;/ref&gt; '''Helius''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|iː|l|i|ə|s}} {{respell|HEE|lee-əs}}; {{lang|grc|Ἥλιος}}, ''[[Helios]]'', literally &quot;sun&quot;),&lt;ref name=&quot;simbolismo&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Álvaro, Jr., Santos| first = Allan| title = Simbolismo divino| url = http://books.google.com/?id=uAiConL3xyYC| publisher = Allan Álvaro, Jr., Santos }}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Phanaeus''' ({{IPAc-en|f|ə|ˈ|n|iː|ə|s}} {{respell|fə|NEE|əs}}; {{lang|grc|Φαναῖος}}, ''Phanaios'', literally &quot;giving or bringing light&quot;), and '''[[Apollo Lyceus|Lyceus]]''' ({{IPAc-en|l|aɪ|ˈ|s|iː|ə|s}} {{respell|ly|SEE|əs}}; {{lang|grc|Λύκειος}}, ''Lykeios'', from [[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]] *{{lang|grc|λύκη}}, &quot;light&quot;). The meaning of the epithet &quot;Lyceus&quot; later became associated Apollo's mother [[Leto]], who was the patron goddess of [[Lycia]] ({{lang|grc|Λυκία}}) and who was identified with the wolf ({{lang|grc|λύκος}}),&lt;ref&gt;Aelian, ''On the Nature of Animals'' 4. 4 (A.F.

As god of the sun, the Romans referred to Apollo as '''[[Sol (mythology)|Sol]]''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɒ|l}} {{respell|SOL|'}}; literally &quot;sun&quot; in Latin).

In association with his birthplace, [[Cynthus|Mount Cynthus]] on the island of [[Delos]], Apollo was called '''Cynthius''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|n|θ|i|ə|s}} {{respell|SIN|thee-əs}}; {{lang|grc|Κύνθιος}}, ''Kunthios'', literally &quot;Cynthian&quot;), '''Cynthogenes''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ɪ|n|ˈ|θ|ɒ|dʒ|ɨ|n|iː|z}} {{respell|sin|THOJ|i-neez}}; {{lang|grc|Κυνθογενής}}, ''Kynthogenēs'', literally &quot;born of Cynthus&quot;), and '''Delius''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|iː|l|i|ə|s}} {{respell|DEE|lee-əs}}; Δήλιος, ''Delios'', literally &quot;Delian&quot;). As [[Artemis]]'s twin, Apollo had the epithet '''Didymaeus''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ɪ|d|ɨ|ˈ|m|iː|ə|s}} {{respell|did-i|MEE|əs}}; {{lang|grc|Διδυμαῖος}}, ''Didymaios'', from δίδυμος, &quot;twin&quot;).

The epithet &quot;Smintheus&quot; has historically been confused with {{lang|grc|σμίνθος}}, &quot;mouse&quot;, in association with Apollo's role as a god of disease. For this he was also known as '''Parnopius''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ɑr|ˈ|n|oʊ|p|i|ə|s}} {{respell|par|NOH|pee-əs}}; {{lang|grc|Παρνόπιος}}, ''Parnopios'', from {{lang|grc|πάρνοψ}}, &quot;locust&quot;) and to the Romans as '''Culicarius''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|juː|l|ɨ|ˈ|k|ær|i|ə|s}} {{respell|KEW|li|KARR|ee-əs}}; from Latin ''culicārius'', &quot;of midges&quot;).

==Origins==
[[File:Omphalos museum.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Omphalos]] in the Museum of [[Delphi]]]]
The cult centers of Apollo in Greece, [[Delphi]] and [[Delos]], date from the 8th century BCE. The Delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to [[Artemis]], Apollo's twin sister. At Delphi, Apollo was venerated as the slayer of [[Pytho]]. For the Greeks, Apollo was all the Gods in one and through the centuries he acquired different functions which could originate from different gods. In [[archaic period in Greece|archaic Greece]] he was the [[prophet]], the oracular god who in older times was connected with &quot;healing&quot;. In [[classical period in Greece|classical Greece]] he was the god of light and of music, but in popular religion he had a strong function to keep away evil.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967)&quot;.Die Geschicte der Giechischen Religion.Vol I&quot;.C.F.Beck Verlag.Munchen. p 529&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Burkert]]&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, Walter. ''Greek Religion'', 1985:144.&lt;/ref&gt; discerned three components in the prehistory of Apollo worship, which he termed &quot;a Dorian-northwest Greek component, a Cretan-Minoan component, and a Syro-Hittite component.&quot;

From his eastern-origin Apollo brought the art of inspection from &quot;symbols and [[omen|omina]]&quot; (σημεία και τέρατα : ''semeia kai terata''), and of the observation of the [[omen]]s of the days. The inspiration oracular-cult was probably introduced from [[Anatolia]]. The [[ritualism]] belonged to Apollo from the beginning. The Greeks created the [[Legalism (Western philosophy)|legalism]], the supervision of the orders of the gods, and the demand for moderation and harmony. Apollo became the god of shining youth, the protector of music, spiritual-life, moderation and perceptible order. The improvement of the old [[Anatolia]]n god, and his elevation to an intellectual sphere, may be considered an achievement of the [[Greek people|Greek]] people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nilsson563&quot;&gt;[[Martin P. Nilsson|Martin Nilsson]]. ''Die Geschichte der Griechische Religion Vol I'', pp. 563-564&lt;/ref&gt;

===Healer and god-protector from evil===
The function of Apollo as a &quot;healer&quot; is connected with [[Paean (god)|Paean]] ({{lang|grc|Παιών-Παιήων}}), the physician of the Gods in the ''[[Iliad]]'', who seems to come from a more primitive religion. Paeοn is probably connected with the [[Mycenean Greece|Mycenean]] ''pa-ja-wo-ne'' ([[Linear B]]: {{lang|gmy|𐀞𐀊𐀍𐀚}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mycenaeans|url=http://books.google.gr/books?id=QXwzT1048Z4C&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;pg=PA160#v=onepage&amp;f=false|page=160|first=Louise|last=Schofield|year=2007|publisher=The British Museum Press|isbn=978-0-89236-867-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minoan.deaditerranean.com/linear-b-transliterations/knossos/kn-v/kn-v/#toc-kn-v-52|title=KN V 52+|website=Deaditerranean: Minoan Linear A &amp; Mycenaean Linear B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chawick&gt;{{cite book|last=Chadwick|first=John|author-link=John Chadwick|title=The Mycenaean World|location=Cambridge, UK|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1976|isbn=0-521-29037-6|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RMj7M_tGaNMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA89#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=89}} At Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; but this is not certain. He did not have a separate cult, but he was the personification of the holy magic-song sung by the magicians that was supposed to cure disease. Later the Greeks knew the original meaning of the relevant song &quot;paean&quot; ({{lang|grc|παιάν}}). The magicians were also called &quot;seer-doctors&quot; ({{lang|grc|ἰατρομάντεις}}), and they used an ecstatic prophetic art which was used exactly by the god Apollo at the oracles.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|grc|Ἐπὶ καταπαύσει λοιμῶν καὶ νόσων ᾄδόμενος}}. ''Which is sung to stop the plagues and the diseases''. Proklos: Chrestom from Photios Bibl. code. 239, p. 321: Martin Nilsson. Die Geschicthe der Griechischen religion. Vol I p.543&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Iliad'', Apollo is the healer under the gods, but he is also the bringer of disease and death with his arrows, similar to the function of the terrible [[Vedic]] god of disease [[Rudra]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin Nilsson 1967 p.541&quot;&gt;&quot;The conception that the diseases come from invisible shots sent by magicians or supernatural beings is common in primitive people and also in European folklore. In North-Europe they speak of the &quot;Elf-shots&quot;. In Sweden where the Lapps were called magicians, they speak of the &quot;Lappen-shots&quot;. Martin Nilsson (1967).Vol I p.541&lt;/ref&gt; He sends a terrible plague ({{lang|grc|λοιμός}}) to the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]]. The god who sends a disease can also prevent from it; therefore, when it stops, they make a purifying ceremony and offer him a [[hecatomb]] to ward off evil. When the oath of his priest appeases, they pray and with a song they call their own god, the beautiful ''Paean''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ilias]] A 314. Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I p.543&lt;/ref&gt;

Some common epithets of Apollo as a healer are &quot;paion&quot; ({{lang|grc|παιών}}, &quot;touching&quot;),{{cn|date=March 2014}} &quot;epikourios&quot; ({{lang|grc|ἐπικουρώ}}, &quot;help&quot;), &quot;oulios&quot; ({{lang|grc|οὐλή}}, &quot;cured wound&quot;),{{cn|date=March 2014|reason=Oule (see LSJ) is commonly translated as &quot;wound scarred over, scar&quot;, i.e. the same as in modern Greek.}} and &quot;loimios&quot; ({{lang|grc|λοιμός}}, &quot;plague&quot;). In classical times, his strong function in popular religion was to keep away evil, and was therefore called &quot;apotropaios&quot; ({{lang|grc|ἀποτρέπω}}, &quot;divert&quot;, &quot;deter&quot;, &quot;avert&quot;) and &quot;alexikakos&quot; (from [[verb|v.]] {{lang|grc|ἀλέξω}} + [[noun|n.]] {{lang|grc|κακόν}}, &quot;defend from evil&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias VIII 41, 8-IV 34, 7-Sittig.

Homer illustrated Paeon the god, and the song both of [[apotropaic]] thanksgiving or triumph.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}
Such songs were originally addressed to Apollo, and afterwards to other gods: to [[Dionysus]], to Apollo [[Helios]], to Apollo's son [[Asclepius]] the healer. About the 4th century BCE, the paean became merely a formula of adulation; its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune, or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered. It was in this way that Apollo had become recognised as the god of music. Apollo's role as the slayer of the [[Python (mythology)|Python]] led to his association with battle and victory; hence it became the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] custom for a paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle, when a fleet left the harbour, and also after a victory had been won.

===Dorian origin===

The connection with Dorians and their initiation festival ''[[apella]]i''{{clarification|date=March 2014|reason=Same as the one at the etymology section; please clarify -or rephrase- how the linked to Spartan Assembly is a Festival.}} is reinforced by the month ''Apellaios'' in northwest Greek calendars,&lt;ref&gt;Graf, ''Apollo'' p. 104-113; Burkert also notes in this context [[Archilochus]] ''Fr.'' 94.&lt;/ref&gt; but it can explain only the Doric type of the name, which is connected with the [[Ancient Macedonian language|Ancient Macedonian]] word &quot;pella&quot; ([[Pella]]), ''stone''. Stones played an important part in the cult of the god, especially in the oracular shrine of Delphi ([[Omphalos]]).&lt;ref&gt;Compare: [[Baetylus]]. In Semitic: sacred stone&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I. p. 556&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;Homeric hymn&quot; represents Apollo as a Northern intruder. His arrival must have occurred during the &quot;dark ages&quot; that followed the destruction of the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean civilization]], and his conflict with [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] (Mother Earth) was represented by the legend of his slaying her daughter the serpent [[Python (mythology)|Python]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert W. Park (1956). ''The delphic oracle''. Vol.I, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

The earth deity had power over the ghostly world, and it is believed that she was the deity behind the oracle.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Farnel(1909)''The cult of the city states. Clarendon Press. VIII pp.8-10''&lt;/ref&gt; The older tales mentioned two dragons who were perhaps intentionally conflated. A female dragon named [[Delphyne]] ({{lang|grc|δελφύς}}, &quot;womb&quot;), who is obviously connected with Delphi and ''Apollo Delphinios'', and a male serpent [[Typhon]] ({{lang|grc|τύφειν}}, &quot;to smoke&quot;), the adversary of [[Zeus]] in the [[Titanomachy]], who the narrators confused with [[Python (mythology)|Python]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Many pictures show the serpent Python living in amity with Apollo and guarding the Omphalos.

Apollo and his sister [[Artemis]] can bring death with their arrows. The conception that diseases and death come from invisible shots sent by supernatural beings, or magicians is common in [[Germanic mythology|Germanic]] and [[Norse mythology|Norse]] mythology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin Nilsson 1967 p.541&quot;/&gt; In [[Greek mythology]] Artemis was the leader ({{lang|grc|ἡγεμών}}, &quot;hegemon&quot;) of the [[nymphs]], who had similar functions with the [[Norse mythology|Nordic]] [[Elf|Elves]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nilsson499&quot;&gt;. Martin Nilsson (1967), Vol I, pp. 499-500&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;elf-shot&quot; originally indicated disease or death attributed to the elves, but it was later attested denoting [[arrow (weapon)|arrow]]-heads which were used by witches to harm people, and also for healing rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Alaric. 2005.

The [[Vedic]] Rudra has some similar functions with Apollo. The terrible god is called &quot;The Archer&quot;, and the bow is also an attribute of [[Shiva]].&lt;ref&gt;For {{IAST|Śarva}} as a name of Shiva see: Apte, p. 910.&lt;/ref&gt; Rudra could bring diseases with his arrows, but he was able to free people of them, and his alternative Shiba, is a healer physician god.&lt;ref&gt;For association between Rudra and disease, with Rigvedic references, see: Bhandarkar, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; However the [[Indo-European language|Indo-European]] component of Apollo, does not explain his strong relation with omens, exorcisms, and with the oracular cult.

===Minoan origin===
[[File:AMI - Goldene Doppelaxt.jpg|thumb|250px|Ornamented golden [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[labrys]]]]
It seems an oracular cult existed in Delphi from the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] ages.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Odyssey]]'' 8.80&lt;/ref&gt; In historical times, the priests of Delphi were called [[labrys|Labryaden]], &quot;the double-axe men&quot;, which indicates [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] origin. The double-axe, [[labrys]], was the holy symbol of the [[Crete|Cretan]] [[labyrinth]].&lt;ref&gt;Huxley (1975).''Cretan Paewones. Roman and Byzantine studies'' pp.129-134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.G.Wunderlich. ''The secret of Creta'' Souvenir Press Ltd. London p. 319&lt;/ref&gt; The Homeric hymn adds that Apollo appeared as a dolphin and carried Cretan priests to Delphi, where they evidently transferred their religious practices. ''Apollo Delphinios'' was a sea-god especially worshiped in Crete and in the islands, and his name indicates his connection with Delphi&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I p. 529&lt;/ref&gt; and the holy serpent [[Delphyne]] (&quot;womb&quot;).{{cn|date=March 2014|reason=Sources needed on both A.&quot;Delphyne (&quot;womb&quot;)&quot; (going from &quot;delphys=&quot;womb&quot;&quot; to &quot;Delphyne=&quot;womb&quot;&quot; is something unsubstantiated) and B.Delphinios connected to Delphyne.}} Apollo's sister [[Artemis]], who was the Greek goddess of hunting, is identified with [[Britomartis]] ([[Diktynna]]), the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] &quot;Mistress of the animals&quot;. In her earliest depictions she is accompanied by the &quot;Mister of the animals&quot;, a male god of hunting who had the bow as his attribute. We don't know his original name, but it seems that he was absorbed by the more powerful Apollo, who stood by the &quot;Mistress of the animals&quot;, becoming her brother.&lt;ref name=Nilsson499/&gt;

The old oracles in Delphi seem to be connected with a local tradition of the priesthood, and there is not clear evidence that a kind of inspiration-prophecy existed in the temple. This led some scholars to the conclusion that Pythia carried on the rituals in a consistent procedure through many centuries, according to the local tradition. In that regard, the mythical seeress [[Sibyl]] of [[Anatolia]]n origin, with her ecstatic art, looks unrelated to the oracle itself.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Bowden (2005). ''Classical Athens and the Delphic oracle'' pp. 17-18&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Greek tradition is referring to the existence of vapours and chewing of laurel-leaves, which seem to be confirmed by recent studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = William J. Broad| title = The oracle: the lost secrets and hidden message of ancient Delphi| year = 2006| publisher = Penguin Group USA| isbn = 1-59420-081-5| page = 32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]] describes the priestesses of Delphi and [[Dodona]] as frenzied women, obsessed by &quot;mania&quot; ({{lang|grc|μανία}}, &quot;frenzy&quot;), a Greek word he connected with ''mantis'' ({{lang|grc|μάντις}}, &quot;prophet&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|ma/ntis|μάντις|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Frenzied women like Sibyls from whose lips the god speaks are recorded in the [[Near East]] as [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] in the second millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Burkert (1985).''The Greek religion''.p.116&lt;/ref&gt; Although Crete had contacts with Mari from 2000 BC,&lt;ref&gt;F.Schachermeyer (1964).p.128&lt;/ref&gt; there is no evidence that the ecstatic prophetic art existed during the Minoan and Mycenean ages. It is more probable that this art was introduced later from [[Anatolia]] and regenerated an existing oracular cult that was local to Delphi and dormant in several areas of Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I, pp. 543-545&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anatolian origin===
[[File:Coin of Apollo Agyieus.png|thumb|250px|Illustration of a coin of Apollo Agyieus from [[Ambracia]]]]
A non-Greek origin of Apollo has long been assumed in scholarship.&lt;ref name=&quot;DDD&quot;/&gt; The name of Apollo's mother [[Leto]] has [[Lydia]]n origin, and she was worshipped on the coasts of [[Asia Minor]]. The inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced into Greece from [[Anatolia]], which is the origin of [[Sibyl]], and where existed some of the oldest oracular shrines. Omens, symbols, purifications, and exorcisms appear in old [[Assyria|Assyro]]-[[Babylon]]ian texts, and these rituals were spread into the empire of the [[Hittites]]. In a Hittite text is mentioned that the king invited a Babylonian priestess for a certain &quot;purification&quot;.&lt;ref name=Nilsson563/&gt;

A similar story is mentioned by [[Plutarch]]. He writes that the [[Creta]]n [[prophet|seer]] [[Epimenides]], purified [[Athens]] after the pollution brought by the [[Alcmeonidae]], and that the seer's expertise in [[sacrifice]]s and reform of funeral practices were of great help to [[Solon]] in his reform of the Athenian state.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Solon'', 12; [[Aristotle]], ''[[Constitution of the Athenians#Aristotle|Ath. Pol]]''. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The story indicates that Epimenides was probably heir to the shamanic religions of Asia, and proves together with the [[Homeric]] hymn, that Crete had a resisting religion up to the historical times. It seems that these rituals were dormant in Greece, and they were reinforced when the Greeks migrated to [[Anatolia]].

[[Homer]] pictures Apollo on the side of the [[Troy|Trojans]], fighting against the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]], during the [[Trojan War]]. He is pictured as a terrible god, less trusted by the Greeks than other gods. The god seems to be related to ''Appaliunas'', a tutelary god of [[Wilusa]] ([[Troy]]) in Asia Minor, but the word is not complete.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Kretschmer]] (1936). Glotta XXIV p. 250. Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I p. 559.&lt;/ref&gt; The stones found in front of the gates of [[Homer]]ic Troy were the symbols of Apollo. The Greeks gave to him the name {{lang|grc|ἀγυιεύς}} ''[[agyieus]]'' as the protector god of public places and houses who wards off evil, and his symbol was a tapered stone or column.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson, ''Die Geschichte der Griechische Religion.'' vol. I (C.H. Beck) 1955:563f.&lt;/ref&gt; However, while usually Greek festivals were celebrated at the [[full moon]], all the feasts of Apollo were celebrated at the seventh day of the month, and the emphasis given to that day (''sibutu'') indicates a [[Babylonia]]n origin.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I, p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Late Bronze Age]] (from 1700 to 1200 BCE) [[Hittites|Hittite]] and [[Hurrian]] ''Aplu'' was a god of [[Plague (disease)|plague]], invoked during plague years. Here we have an [[apotrope|apotropaic]] situation, where a god originally bringing the plague was invoked to end it. Aplu, meaning ''the son of'', was a title given to the god [[Nergal]], who was linked to the Babylonian god of the sun [[Shamash]].&lt;ref name=Grummond /&gt; Homer interprets Apollo as a terrible god ({{lang|grc|δεινὸς θεός}}) who brings death and disease with his arrows, but who can also heal, possessing a magic art that separates him from the other Greek gods.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I. pp. 559-560.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Iliad]]'', his priest prays to ''Apollo Smintheus'',&lt;ref&gt;&quot;You Apollo Smintheus, let my tears become your arrows against the Danaans, for revenge&quot;. [[Iliad]] 1.33 (A 33).&lt;/ref&gt; the mouse god who retains an older agricultural function as the protector from field rats.&lt;ref&gt;An ancient aetiological myth connects ''sminthos'' with mouse and suggests Cretan origin. Apollo is the mouse-god (Strabo 13.1.48).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LSJsmintheus/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Sminthia&quot; in several areas of Greece. In [[Rhodes]] (Lindos) they belong to Apollo and Dionysos who have destroyed the rats that were swallowing the grapes&quot;. Martin Nilsson (1967). pp. 534-535.&lt;/ref&gt; All these functions, including the function of the healer-god [[Paean (god)|Paean]], who seems to have Mycenean origin, are fused in the cult of Apollo.

==Oracular cult==
[[File:Columns of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, Greece.jpeg|thumb|250px|Columns of the [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Temple of Apollo]] at Delphi, Greece]]
Unusually among the Olympic deities, Apollo had two cult sites that had widespread influence: [[Delos]] and [[Delphi]]. In cult practice, [[Delos|Delian Apollo]] and [[Pythian Apollo]] (the Apollo of Delphi) were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert 1985:143.&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo's [[Cult (religion)|cult]] was already fully established when written sources commenced, about 650 BCE. Apollo became extremely important to the Greek world as an oracular deity in the [[Archaic Greece|archaic period]], and the frequency of [[theophoric names]] such as ''Apollodorus'' or ''Apollonios'' and cities named ''Apollonia'' testify to his popularity. Oracular sanctuaries to Apollo were established in other sites. In the 2nd and 3rd century CE, those at [[Didyma]] and [[Clarus]] pronounced the so-called &quot;theological oracles&quot;, in which Apollo confirms that all deities are aspects or servants of an [[Monism#Monism, pantheism, and panentheism|all-encompassing, highest deity]]. &quot;In the 3rd century, Apollo fell silent. [[Julian the Apostate]] (359 - 61) tried to revive the Delphic oracle, but failed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DDD&quot;/&gt;

===Oracular shrines===
[[File:Delos lions.jpg|thumb|250px|Delos lions]]
Apollo had a famous [[oracle]] in Delphi, and other notable ones in [[Clarus]] and [[Branchidae]]. His oracular shrine in [[Abae]] in [[Phocis]], where he bore the [[toponym]]ic epithet ''[[Abaeus]]'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀπόλλων Ἀβαῖος}}, ''Apollon Abaios'') was important enough to be consulted by [[Croesus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], 1.46.&lt;/ref&gt;
His oracular shrines include:
* [[Abae]] in [[Phocis]].
* [[Bassae]] in the [[Peloponnese]].
* At [[Clarus]], on the west coast of [[Asia Minor]]; as at Delphi a holy spring which gave off a ''pneuma'', from which the priests drank.
* In [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], the Oracle of Corinth came from the town of [[Tenea]], from prisoners supposedly taken in the Trojan War.
* At [[Khyrse]], in [[Troad]], the temple was built for Apollo Smintheus.
* In [[Delos]], there was an oracle to the Delian Apollo, during summer. The Hieron (Sanctuary) of Apollo adjacent to the Sacred Lake, was the place where the god was said to have been born.
* In [[Delphi]], the [[Pythia]] became filled with the ''[[pneuma]]'' of Apollo, said to come from a spring inside the [[Adyton]].
* In [[Didyma]], an oracle on the coast of [[Anatolia]], south west of [[Lydia]]n ([[Luwian]]) [[Sardis]], in which priests from the lineage of the Branchidae received inspiration by drinking from a healing spring located in the temple. Was believed to have been founded by [[Branchus]], son or lover of Apollo.
* In [[Manbij|Hierapolis Bambyce]], Syria (modern Manbij), according to the treatise ''[[De Dea Syria]]'', the sanctuary of the [[Atargatis|Syrian Goddess]] contained a robed and bearded image of Apollo. Divination was based on spontaneous movements of this image.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucian]] (attrib.), ''[[De Dea Syria]]'' [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/luc/tsg/tsg07.htm#35 35–37].&lt;/ref&gt;
* At [[Patara (Lycia)|Patara]], in [[Lycia]], there was a seasonal winter oracle of Apollo, said to have been the place where the god went from Delos. As at Delphi the oracle at Patara was a woman.
* In [[Segesta]] in Sicily.

Oracles were also given by sons of Apollo.
* In [[Oropus]], north of [[Athens]], the oracle [[Amphiaraus]], was said to be the son of Apollo; Oropus also had a sacred spring.
* in Labadea, {{convert|20|mi|km}} east of Delphi, [[Trophonius]], another son of Apollo, killed his brother and fled to the cave where he was also afterwards consulted as an oracle.

==Mythology==

===Birth===
[[File:Apollo Artemis Brygos Louvre G151.jpg|thumb|250px|Apollo (left) and [[Artemis]]. [[Brygos]] (potter signed), tondo of an Attic red-figure cup c. 470 BC, [[Musée du Louvre]].]]
When Zeus' wife [[Hera]] discovered that Leto was pregnant and that Zeus was the father, she banned [[Leto]] from giving birth on &quot;terra firma&quot;. In her wanderings, Leto found the newly created floating island of [[Delos]], which was neither mainland nor a real island. She gave birth there and was accepted by the people, offering them her promise that her son would be always favourable toward the city. Afterwards, Zeus secured Delos to the bottom of the ocean. This island later became sacred to Apollo.

It is also stated that Hera kidnapped [[Eileithyia]], the goddess of childbirth, to prevent Leto from going into labor. The other gods tricked Hera into letting her go by offering her a necklace, nine yards (8 m) long, of amber. Mythographers agree that [[Artemis]] was born first and then assisted with the birth of Apollo, or that Artemis was born one day before Apollo, on the island of [[Ortygia]] and that she helped Leto cross the sea to Delos the next day to give birth to Apollo. Apollo was born on the seventh day ({{lang|grc|ἑβδομαγενής}}, ''hebdomagenes'')&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|e(bdomagenh/s|ἑβδομαγενής|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of the month Thargelion —according to Delian tradition—or of the month Bysios—according to Delphian tradition. The seventh and twentieth, the days of the new and full moon, were ever afterwards held sacred to him.

===Youth===
Four days after his birth, Apollo killed the [[chthonic]] dragon [[Python (mythology)|Python]], which lived in [[Delphi]] beside the [[Castalian Spring]]. This was the spring which emitted vapors that caused the oracle at Delphi to give her prophecies. Hera sent the serpent to hunt Leto to her death across the world. To protect his mother, Apollo begged [[Hephaestus]] for a bow and arrows. After receiving them, Apollo cornered Python in the sacred cave at Delphi.&lt;ref&gt;''Children of the Gods'' by Kenneth McLeish, page 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo killed Python but had to be punished for it, since Python was a child of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]].

Hera then sent the giant [[Tityos]] to kill Leto. This time Apollo was aided by his sister Artemis in protecting their mother. During the battle Zeus finally relented his aid and hurled Tityos down to [[Tartarus]]. There he was pegged to the rock floor, covering an area of {{convert|9|acre|m2}}, where a pair of [[vulture]]s feasted daily on his liver.

===Trojan War===
Apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the Greek encampment during the [[Trojan War]] in retribution for [[Agamemnon]]'s insult to [[Chryses]], a priest of Apollo whose daughter [[Chryseis]] had been captured. He demanded her return, and the Achaeans complied, indirectly causing the anger of Achilles, which is the theme of the ''[[Iliad]]''.

In the ''[[Iliad]]'', when [[Diomedes]] injured [[Aeneas]], Apollo rescued him. First, [[Aphrodite]] tried to rescue Aeneas but Diomedes injured her as well. Aeneas was then enveloped in a cloud by Apollo, who took him to Pergamos, a sacred spot in [[Troy]].

Apollo aided [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] in the killing of [[Achilles]] by guiding the arrow of his bow into [[Achilles]]' heel. One interpretation of his motive is that it was in revenge for Achilles' sacrilege in murdering [[Troilus]], the god's own son by [[Hecuba]], on the very altar of the god's own temple.

===Admetus===
When Zeus struck down Apollo's son Asclepius with a lightning bolt for resurrecting [[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolytus]] from the dead (transgressing [[Themis]] by stealing [[Hades]]'s subjects), Apollo in revenge killed the [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]], who had fashioned the bolt for Zeus.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliothke]]'' iii. 10.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo would have been banished to [[Tartarus]] forever for this, but was instead sentenced to one year of [[Penal labour|hard labor]], due to the intercession of his mother, [[Leto]]. During this time he served as shepherd for [[Admetus|King Admetus]] of [[Pherae]] in [[Thessaly]]. Admetus treated Apollo well, and, in return, the god conferred great benefits on Admetus.

Apollo helped Admetus win [[Alcestis]], the daughter of [[Pelias|King Pelias]] and later convinced the [[Moirai|Fates]] to let Admetus live past his time, if another took his place. But when it came time for Admetus to die, his parents, whom he had assumed would gladly die for him, refused to cooperate. Instead, Alcestis took his place, but [[Heracles]] managed to &quot;''[[Coercion|persuade]]''&quot; [[Thanatos]], the god of death, to return her to the world of the living.

[[File:Niobe JacquesLouisDavid 1772 Dallas Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|250px|''Artemis and Apollo Piercing Niobe's Children with their Arrows'' by [[Jacques-Louis David]], [[Dallas Museum of Art]]]]

===Niobe===
[[Niobe]], the queen of [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and wife of [[Amphion]], boasted of her superiority to Leto because she had fourteen children ([[Niobids]]), seven male and seven female, while Leto had only two. Apollo killed her sons, and Artemis her daughters. Apollo and Artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them, though according to some versions of the myth, a number of the Niobids were spared ([[Chloris]], usually). Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, either killed himself or was killed by Apollo after swearing revenge.

A devastated Niobe fled to [[Spil Mount|Mount Sipylos]] in [[Asia Minor]] and turned into stone as she wept. Her tears formed the river [[Achelous]]. Zeus had turned all the people of Thebes to stone and so no one buried the Niobids until the ninth day after their death, when the gods themselves entombed them.

===Consorts and children===
Love affairs ascribed to Apollo are a late development in Greek mythology.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The love-stories themselves were not told until later.&quot; [[Karl Kerenyi]], ''The Gods of the Greeks'' 1951:140.&lt;/ref&gt; Their vivid anecdotal qualities have made some of them favorites of painters since the Renaissance, the result being that they stand out more prominently in the modern imagination.

====Female lovers====
{{Main|Apollo and Daphne}}

[[File:ApolloAndDaphne.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Apollo and Daphne]] by [[Bernini]] in the [[Galleria Borghese]]]]
[[Daphne]] was a [[nymph]], daughter of the [[Sea and river deity|river god]] [[Peneus]], who had scorned Apollo. The myth explains the connection of Apollo with δάφνη (''daphnē''), the [[Bay Laurel|laurel]] whose leaves his priestess employed at [[Delphi]].&lt;ref&gt;The ancient Daphne episode is noted in late narratives, notably in [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', in [[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'', 203 and by the fourth-century-CE teacher of rhetoric and Christian convert, [[Libanius]], in ''Narrationes''.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ovid]]'s [[Metamorphoses]], Phoebus Apollo chaffs Cupid for toying with a weapon more suited to a man, whereupon Cupid wounds him with a golden dart; simultaneously, however, Cupid shoots a leaden arrow into Daphne, causing her to be repulsed by Apollo. Following a spirited chase by Apollo, Daphne prays to her father, Peneus, for help, and he changes her into the laurel tree, sacred to Apollo.

Fouilles et Recherches I, Temple d'Apollon Daphnéphoros, Architecture'' (Bern, 1968). See also [[Plutarch]], ''Pythian Oracle'', 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leucothea]] was daughter of [[Orchamus]] and sister of [[Clytia]]. She fell in love with Apollo who disguised himself as Leucothea's mother to gain entrance to her chambers. Clytia, jealous of her sister because she wanted Apollo for herself, told Orchamus the truth, betraying her sister's trust and confidence in her. Enraged, Orchamus ordered Leucothea to be buried alive. Apollo refused to forgive Clytia for betraying his beloved, and a grieving Clytia wilted and slowly died. Apollo changed her into an incense plant, either heliotrope or sunflower, which follows the sun every day.

[[Marpessa]] was kidnapped by [[Idas]] but was loved by Apollo as well. [[Zeus]] made her choose between them, and she chose Idas on the grounds that Apollo, being immortal, would tire of her when she grew old.

[[Castalia]] was a [[nymph]] whom Apollo loved. She fled from him and dove into the [[castalian Spring|spring]] at Delphi, at the base of [[Mt. Parnassos]], which was then named after her. Water from this spring was sacred; it was used to clean the Delphian temples and inspire the priestesses. In the last [[oracle]] is mentioned that the &quot;water which could speak&quot;, has been lost for ever.

By [[Cyrene (mythology)|Cyrene]], Apollo had a son named [[Aristaeus]], who became the patron god of cattle, [[fruit trees]], hunting, husbandry and [[bee-keeping]]. He was also a [[culture-hero]] and taught humanity dairy skills, the use of nets and traps in hunting, and how to cultivate olives.

[[Hecuba]], was the wife of King [[Priam]] of [[Troy]], and Apollo had a son with her named [[Troilus]]. An [[oracle]] prophesied that Troy would not be defeated as long as Troilus reached the age of twenty alive. He was ambushed and killed by [[Achilleus]].

[[Cassandra]], was daughter of Hecuba and Priam, and Troilus' half-sister. Apollo fell in love with Cassandra and promised her the gift of prophecy to seduce her, but she rejected him afterwards. Enraged, Apollo indeed gave her the ability to know the future, with a curse that she could only see the future tragedies and that no one would ever believe her.

[[Coronis (Greek mythology)|Coronis]], was daughter of [[Phlegyas]], King of the [[Lapiths]]. Pregnant with [[Asclepius]], Coronis fell in love with [[Ischys]], son of [[Elatus]]. A crow informed Apollo of the affair. When first informed he disbelieved the crow and turned all crows black (where they were previously white) as a punishment for spreading untruths. When he found out the truth he sent his sister, Artemis, to kill Coronis (in other stories, Apollo himself had killed Coronis). As a result he also made the crow sacred and gave them the task of announcing important deaths. Apollo rescued the baby and gave it to the [[centaur]] [[Chiron]] to raise. Phlegyas was irate after the death of his daughter and burned the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. Apollo then killed him for what he did.

In [[Euripides]]' play ''[[Ion (play)|Ion]]'', Apollo fathered [[Ion (mythology)|Ion]] by [[Creusa]], wife of [[Xuthus]]. Creusa left Ion to die in the wild, but Apollo asked [[Hermes]] to save the child and bring him to the oracle at [[Delphi]], where he was raised by a priestess.

[[Acantha]], was the spirit of the [[Acanthus (genus)|acanthus]] tree, and Apollo had one of his other liaisons with her. Upon her death, Apollo transformed her into a sun-loving herb.

According to the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Biblioteca]]'', the &quot;library&quot; of mythology mis-attributed to Apollodorus, he fathered the [[Corybantes]] on the Muse [[Thalia (Muse)|Thalia]].&lt;ref&gt;Apollodorus, [http://www.theoi.com/Text/Apollodorus1.html ''Bibliotheca'', 1.3.4]. Other ancient sources, however, gave the Corybantes different parents; see [[James George Frazer|Sir James Frazer]]'s [http://www.theoi.com/Text/Ap1a.html#46 note] on the passage in the ''Bibliotheca''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Male lovers====
[[File:Hyacinthus.jpg|thumb|upright|''Apollo and Hyacinthus'', 16th-century Italian engraving by [[Jacopo Caraglio]]]]
[[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyacinth]] or Hyacinthus was one of Apollo's male lovers. He was a [[Sparta]]n prince, beautiful and athletic. The pair was practicing throwing the [[Discus throw|discus]] when a discus thrown by Apollo was blown off course by the jealous [[Zephyrus]] and struck Hyacinthus in the head, killing him instantly. Apollo is said to be filled with grief: out of Hyacinthus' blood, Apollo created a [[hyacinth (plant)|flower]] named after him as a memorial to his death, and his tears stained the flower petals with the interjection {{lang|grc|αἰαῖ}}, meaning ''alas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|ai)ai{{=}}|αἰαῖ}}, {{LSJ|ai)/2|αἴ|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Festival of Hyacinthus was a celebration of Sparta.

Another male lover was [[Cyparissus]], a descendant of [[Heracles]]. Apollo gave him a tame deer as a companion but Cyparissus accidentally killed it with a [[Pilum|javelin]] as it lay asleep in the undergrowth. Cyparissus asked Apollo to let his tears fall forever. Apollo granted the request by turning him into the [[Cupressaceae|Cypress]] named after him, which was said to be a sad tree because the sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk.

Other male lovers of Apollo include:
* [[Admetus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Callimachus]], Hymn to Apollo, 49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Plutarch, Numa&quot; /&gt;
* [[Atymnius]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Nonnus]], ''[[Dionysiaca]]'', 11. 258; 19. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise known as a beloved of [[Sarpedon]]
* [[Branchus]] (alternately, a son of Apollo)
* [[Carnus]]
* Clarus&lt;ref&gt;[[Philostratus]], ''Letters'', 5. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hippolytus of [[Sicyon]] (not the same as [[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolytus]])&lt;ref name=&quot;Plutarch, Numa&quot;&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Numa'', 4. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hymenaios]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Antoninus Liberalis]], ''Metamorphoses'', 23.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Iapis]]
* Leucates, who threw himself off a rock when Apollo attempted to carry him off&lt;ref&gt;[[Servius]] on ''[[Aeneid]]'', 3. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Phorbas]] (probably the son of Triopas)&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Numa'', 4. 5, cf. also [[Hyginus]], ''Poetical Astronomy'', 2. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Potnieus&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement of Rome]], ''Homilia'', 5. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apollo's lyre===
[[File:Apollo Kitharoidos Antikensammlung Berlin 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Apollo with his [[lyre]]. Statue from [[Pergamon Museum]], Berlin.]]
[[Hermes]] was born on [[Mount Kyllini|Mount Cyllene]] in Arcadia. The story is told in the [[Homeric Hymn]] to [[Hermes]]. His mother, [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]], had been secretly impregnated by [[Zeus]]. Maia wrapped the infant in blankets but Hermes escaped while she was asleep.

Hermes ran to [[Thessaly]], where Apollo was grazing his cattle. The infant Hermes stole a number of his cows and took them to a cave in the woods near [[Pylos]], covering their tracks. In the cave, he found a [[tortoise]] and killed it, then removed the insides. He used one of the cow's intestines and the tortoise shell and made the first [[lyre]].

Apollo complained to Maia that her son had stolen his cattle, but Hermes had already replaced himself in the blankets she had wrapped him in, so Maia refused to believe Apollo's claim. Zeus intervened and, claiming to have seen the events, sided with Apollo. Hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented. Apollo, a god of music, fell in love with the instrument and offered to allow exchange of the cattle for the lyre. Hence, Apollo then became a master of the lyre.

===Apollo in the ''Oresteia''===
In [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Oresteia]]'' trilogy, [[Clytemnestra]] kills her husband, [[King Agamemnon]] because he had sacrificed their daughter [[Iphigenia]] to proceed forward with the Trojan war, and [[Cassandra]], a prophetess of Apollo. Apollo gives an order through the Oracle at Delphi that Agamemnon's son, [[Orestes]], is to kill Clytemnestra and [[Aegisthus]], her lover. Orestes and Pylades carry out the revenge, and consequently Orestes is pursued by the [[Erinyes]] (Furies, female personifications of [[revenge|vengeance]]).

Apollo and the Furies argue about whether the [[matricide]] was justified; Apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and Orestes was avenging his father, whereas the Erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage. They invade his temple, and he says that the matter should be brought before Athena. Apollo promises to protect Orestes, as Orestes has become Apollo's supplicant. Apollo advocates Orestes at the trial, and ultimately Athena rules with Apollo.

===Other stories===
Apollo killed the [[Aloadae]] when they attempted to storm [[Mount Olympus (Mountain)|Mt. Olympus]].

[[Callimachus]] sang&lt;ref&gt;Callimachus, ''Hymn to Apollo''2.5&lt;/ref&gt; that Apollo rode on the back of a swan to the land of the [[Hyperboreans]] during the winter months.

Apollo turned [[Cephissus (mythology)|Cephissus]] into a [[sea monster]].

Another contender for the birthplace of Apollo is the Cretan islands of [[Paximadia (islands)|Paximadia]].

====Musical contests====

=====Pan=====
Once [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] had the audacity to compare his music with that of Apollo, and to challenge Apollo, the god of the [[kithara]], to a trial of skill. [[Tmolus]], the mountain-god, was chosen to umpire. Pan blew on his pipes, and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower, [[Midas]], who happened to be present. Then Apollo struck the strings of his lyre. Tmolus at once awarded the victory to Apollo, and all but Midas agreed with the judgment. He dissented, and questioned the justice of the award. Apollo would not suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer, and caused them to become the ears of a [[donkey]].

=====Marsyas=====
[[File:IAM 400T - Statue of Marsyas.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marsyas]] under Apollo's punishment, [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums|İstanbul Archaeology Museum]]]]

Apollo has ominous aspects aside from his plague-bringing, death-dealing arrows: [[Marsyas]] was a [[satyr]] who challenged Apollo to a contest of music. He had found an [[aulos]] on the ground, tossed away after being invented by [[Athena]] because it made her cheeks puffy. The contest was judged by the [[Muse]]s.

After they each performed, both were deemed equal until Apollo decreed they play and sing at the same time. As Apollo played the [[lyre]], this was easy to do. Marsyas could not do this, as he only knew how to use the flute and could not sing at the same time. Apollo was declared the winner because of this. Apollo [[flaying|flayed]] Marsyas alive in a cave near [[Celaenae]] in [[Phrygia]] for his [[hubris]] to challenge a god. He then nailed Marsyas' shaggy skin to a nearby pine-tree. Marsyas' blood turned into the river [[Marsyas (river)|Marsyas]].

Another variation is that Apollo played his instrument (the lyre) upside down. Marsyas could not do this with his instrument (the [[flute]]), and so Apollo hung him from a tree and flayed him alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Man Myth and Magic'' by Richard Cavendish&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Cinyras=====
Apollo also had a [[lyre]]-playing contest with [[Cinyras]], his son, who committed suicide when he lost.

===Roman Apollo===
The Roman worship of Apollo was adopted from the Greeks. As a quintessentially [[List of Greek mythological figures|Greek god]], Apollo had no direct Roman equivalent, although later Roman poets often referred to him as '''Phoebus'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Heroine/Koronis.html |title=Koronis |publisher=Theoi |accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a tradition that the Delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the [[Roman Kingdom|kings of Rome]] during the reign of [[Tarquinius Superbus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Liv.+1.56 1.56].&lt;/ref&gt;

On the occasion of a pestilence in the 430s BCE, Apollo's [[Temple of Apollo Sosianus|first temple]] at Rome was established in the Flaminian fields, replacing an older cult site there known as the &quot;Apollinare&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Livy [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0026:book=3:chapter=63 3.63.7], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0145:book=4:chapter=25 4.25.3].&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Second Punic War]] in 212 BCE, the ''[[Ludi Apollinares]]'' (&quot;Apollonian Games&quot;) were instituted in his honor, on the instructions of a prophecy attributed to one Marcius.&lt;ref&gt;Livy [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0147:book=25:chapter=12 25.12].&lt;/ref&gt; In the time of [[Augustus]], who considered himself under the special protection of Apollo and was even said to be his son, his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=J. H. W. G. Liebeschuetz |title=Continuity and Change in Roman Religion |year=1979 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-814822-4 |pages=82–85 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[battle of Actium]], which was fought near a sanctuary of Apollo, Augustus enlarged Apollo's temple, dedicated a portion of the spoils to him, and instituted [[quinquennial]] games in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars#Life of Augustus|Augustus]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#18.2 18.2]; [[Cassius Dio]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/51*.html#1 51.1.1–3].&lt;/ref&gt; He also erected [[Temple of Apollo (Palatine)|a new temple]] to the god on the [[Palatine Hill|Palatine hill]].&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/53*.html#1.3 53.1.3].&lt;/ref&gt; Sacrifices and prayers on the Palatine to Apollo and [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] formed the culmination of the [[Secular Games]], held in 17 BCE to celebrate the dawn of a new era.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae]]'' 5050, translated by {{cite book |last1=Beard |first1=Mary |authorlink=Mary Beard (classicist) |last2=North |first2=John |last3=Price |first3=Simon |title=Religions of Rome: Volume 2: A Sourcebook |year=1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-45015-2|page=5.7b }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festivals==
The chief Apollonian festivals were the [[Boedromia]], [[Carneia]], Carpiae, [[Daphnephoria]], [[Delia (festival)|Delia]], [[Hyacinthia]], [[Metageitnia]], [[Pyanepsia]], [[Pythia]] and [[Thargelia]].

==Attributes and symbols==
[[File:Ai-Khanoum-gold stater of Antiochos1.jpg|thumb|250px|Gold stater of the [[Seleucid]] king [[Antiochus I Soter]] (reigned 281–261 BCE) showing on the reverse a nude Apollo holding his key attributes: two arrows and a bow]]
Apollo's most common attributes were the bow and [[arrow]]. Other attributes of his included the [[kithara]] (an advanced version of the common [[lyre]]), the [[plectrum]] and the sword. Another common emblem was the [[sacrificial tripod]], representing his prophetic powers. The [[Pythian Games]] were held in Apollo's honor every four years at [[Delphi]]. The [[bay laurel]] plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the [[laurel wreath|crown of victory]] at these games.

The [[palm tree]] was also sacred to Apollo because he had been born under one in [[Delos]]. Animals sacred to Apollo included [[wolf|wolves]], dolphins, [[roe deer]], [[swan]]s, [[cicada]]s (symbolizing music and song), [[hawk]]s, [[raven]]s, [[crow]]s, snakes (referencing Apollo's function as the god of prophecy), mice and [[griffin]]s, mythical eagle–lion hybrids of Eastern origin.

[[File:Apolocitaredo8.jpg|thumb|250px||''[[Apollo Citharoedus]]'' (&quot;Apollo with a kithara&quot;), [[Musei Capitolini]], Rome]]
As god of colonization, Apollo gave oracular guidance on colonies, especially during the height of colonization, 750–550 BCE. According to Greek tradition, he helped [[Crete|Cretan]] or [[Arcadia]]n colonists found the city of [[Troy]]. However, this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction: [[Hittites|Hittite]] [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] texts mention a Minor Asian god called ''Appaliunas'' or ''Apalunas'' in connection with the city of [[Wilusa]] attested in Hittite inscriptions, which is now generally regarded as being identical with the Greek [[Troy|Ilion]] by most scholars. In this interpretation, Apollo's title of ''Lykegenes'' can simply be read as &quot;born in Lycia&quot;, which effectively severs the god's supposed link with wolves (possibly a [[folk etymology]]).

In literary contexts, Apollo represents harmony, order, and reason—characteristics contrasted with those of [[Dionysus]], god of wine, who represents ecstasy and disorder. The contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives [[Apollonian and Dionysian]]. However, the Greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary: the two gods are brothers, and when Apollo at winter left for [[Hyperborea]], he would leave the Delphic oracle to Dionysus. This contrast appears to be shown on the two sides of the [[Borghese Vase]].

Apollo is often associated with the [[Golden mean (philosophy)|Golden Mean]]. This is the Greek [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] of [[moderation]] and a [[virtue]] that opposes [[gluttony]].

==Apollo in the arts==
[[File:Apollo Saurocton Louvre.jpg|thumb|180px|The Louvre ''Apollo Sauroctonos'', Roman copy after  [[Praxiteles]] (360 BC)]]
'''Apollo''' is a common theme in Greek and Roman art and also in the art of the [[Renaissance]]. The earliest Greek word for a statue is &quot;delight&quot; ({{lang|grc|ἄγαλμα}}, ''agalma''), and the sculptors tried to create forms which would inspire such guiding vision. Greek art puts into '''Apollo''' the highest degree of power and beauty that can be imagined. The sculptors derived this from observations on human beings, but they also embodied in concrete form, issues beyond the reach of ordinary thought.

The naked bodies of the statues are associated with the cult of the body that was essentially a religious activity. The muscular frames and limbs combined with slim waists indicate the Greek desire for health, and the physical capacity which was necessary in the hard Greek environment. The statues of Apollo embody beauty, balance and inspire awe before the beauty of the world.

The evolution of the Greek sculpture can be observed in his depictions from the almost static formal [[Kouros]] type in [[Archaic period in Greece|early archaic period]], to the representation of motion in a relative harmonious whole in [[Archaic period in Greece|late archaic period]]. In [[classical Greece]] the emphasis is not given to the illusive imaginative reality represented by the ideal forms, but to the analogies and the interaction of the members in the whole, a method created by [[Polykleitos]]. Finally [[Praxiteles]] seems to be released from any art and religious conformities, and his masterpieces are a mixture of [[Realism (arts)|naturalism]] with stylization.

===Art and Greek philosophy===
The evolution of the Greek art seems to go parallel with the Greek philosophical conceptions, which changed from the natural-philosophy of [[Thales]] to the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] theory of [[Pythagoras]]. Thales searched for a simple material-form directly perceptible by the senses, behind the appearances of things, and his theory is also related to the older [[animism]]. This was paralleled in sculpture by the absolute representation of vigorous life, through unnaturally simplified forms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Homann63&quot;&gt;E. Homann-Wedeking. Transl. J.R. Foster (1968). ''Art of the world. Archaic Greece'', Methuen &amp; Co Ltd. London, pp 63-65, 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pythagoras believed that behind the appearance of things, there was the permanent principle of mathematics, and that the forms were based on a transcendental mathematical relation.&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Bowra (1957). ''The Greek experience'', p.166.&lt;/ref&gt; The forms on earth, are imperfect imitations ({{lang|grc|εἰκόνες}}, ''eikones'', &quot;images&quot;) of the celestial world of numbers. His ideas had a great influence on post-Archaic art, and the Greek architects and sculptors were always trying to find the mathematical relation, that would lead to the esthetic perfection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carpenter55&quot;&gt;R. Carpenter (1975). ''The esthetic basis of Greek art''. Indiana University Press. p. 55-58.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Aesthetic canon|canon]]).

In classical Greece, [[Anaxagoras]] asserted that a divine reason (mind) gave order to the seeds of the universe, and [[Plato]] extended the Greek belief of ''ideal forms'' to his metaphysical theory of ''forms'' (''ideai'', &quot;ideas&quot;). The forms on earth are imperfect duplicates of the intellectual celestial ideas. The Greek words ''oida'' ({{lang|grc|οἶδα}}, &quot;(I) know&quot;) and ''eidos'' ({{lang|grc|εἶδος}}, &quot;species&quot;) have the same root as the word ''idea'' ({{lang|grc|ἰδέα}}),&lt;ref name =Carpenter55/&gt; indicating how the Greek mind moved from the gift of the senses, to the principles beyond the senses. The artists in Plato's time moved away from his theories and art tends to be a mixture of naturalism with stylization. The Greek sculptors considered the senses more important, and the proportions were used to unite the sensible with the intellectual.

===Archaic sculpture===
[[File:KAMA Kouros Porte Sacrée.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Sacred Gate Kouros, marble (610–600 BC), [[Kerameikos|Kerameikos Archaeological Museum in Athens]]]]

[[Kouros]] (''male youth'') is the modern term given to those representations of standing male youths which first appear in the [[archaic period in Greece]]. This type served certain religious needs and was first proposed for what was previously thought to be depictions of ''Apollo''.&lt;ref&gt;V.I. Leonardos(1895). ''Archaelogiki Ephimeris'', Col 75, n 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lechat (1904). ''La sculpture Attic avant Phidias'', p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The first statues are certainly still and formal. The formality of their stance seems to be related with the [[Egypt]]ian precedent, but it was accepted for a good reason. The sculptors had a clear idea of what a young man is, and embodied the archaic smile of good manners, the firm and springy step, the balance of the body, dignity, and youthful happiness. When they tried to depict the most abiding qualities of men, it was because men had common roots with the unchanging gods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowra144&quot;&gt;C.M. Bowra (1957). ''The Greek experience'', pp. 144-152.&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of a standard recognizable type for a long time, is probably because nature gives preference in survival of a type which has long be adopted by the climatic conditions, and also due to the general Greek belief that nature expresses itself in ''ideal forms'' that can be imagined and represented.&lt;ref name=Carpenter55/&gt; These forms expressed immortality. Apollo was the immortal god of ''ideal balance and order''. His shrine in [[Delphi]], that he shared in winter with Dionysius had the inscriptions: {{lang|grc|γνῶθι σεαυτόν}} (gnōthi seautón = &quot;know thyself&quot;) and {{lang|grc|μηδὲν ἄγαν}} (''mēdén ágan'', &quot;nothing in excess&quot;), and {{lang|grc|ἐγγύα πάρα δ'ἄτη}} (eggýa pára d'atē, &quot;make a pledge and mischief is nigh&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;See {{LSJ|a)/th|ἄτη|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WLA metmuseum Marble statue of a kouros youth 2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|New York Kouros, Met. Mus. 32.11.1, marble (620–610 BC), [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]
In the first large-scale depictions during the early archaic period (640–580 BC), the artists tried to draw one's attention to look into the interior of the face and the body which were not represented as lifeless masses, but as being full of life. The Greeks maintained, until late in their civilization, an almost [[animism|animistic]] idea that the statues are in some sense alive. This embodies the belief that the image was somehow the god or man himself.&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Bowra. ''The Greek experience'', p.159.&lt;/ref&gt; A fine example is the statue of the ''Sacred gate Kouros'' which was found at the cemetery of [[Dipylon]] in Athens ([[Dipylon]] [[Kouros]]). The statue is the &quot;thing in itself&quot;, and his slender face with the deep eyes express an intellectual eternity. According to the Greek tradition the [[Dipylon|Dipylon master]] was named [[Daedalus]], and in his statues the limbs were freed from the body, giving the impression that the statues could move. It is considered that he created also the ''New York kouros'', which is the oldest fully preserved statue of ''Kouros'' type, and seems to be the incarnation of the god himself.&lt;ref name=Homann63/&gt;

[[File:7262 - Piraeus Arch. Museum, Athens - The Piraeus Apollo - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 14 2009.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Piraeus Apollo]], archaic-style bronze, [[Archaeological Museum of Piraeus]]]]
The animistic idea as the representation of the imaginative reality, is sanctified in the [[Homeric]] poems and in Greek myths, in stories of the god [[Hephaestus]] ([[Phaistos]]) and the mythic [[Daedalus]] (the builder of the [[labyrinth]]) that made images which moved of their own accord. This kind of art goes back to the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] period, when its main theme was the representation of motion in a specific moment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schachermeyer242&quot;&gt;F. Schachermeyer (1964). ''Die Minoische Kultur des alten Creta'', Kohlhammer Stuttgart, pp. 242-244.&lt;/ref&gt; These free-standing statues were usually marble, but also the form rendered in limestone, bronze, ivory and terracotta.

The earliest examples of life-sized statues of Apollo, may be two figures from the [[Ionians|Ionic]] sanctuary on the island of [[Delos]]. Such statues were found across the Greek speaking world, the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of Apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of ''Apollo Ptoios'', [[Boeotia]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;J. Ducat (1971). ''Les Kouroi des Ptoion''.&lt;/ref&gt; The last stage in the development of the ''Kouros type'' is the late archaic period (520–485 BC), in which the Greek sculpture attained a full knowledge of human anatomy and used to create a relative harmonious whole. Ranking from the very few bronzes survived to us is the masterpiece bronze [[Piraeus Apollo]]. It was found in [[Piraeus]], the harbour of Athens. The statue originally held the bow in its left hand, and a cup of pouring libation in its right hand. It probably comes from north-eastern [[Peloponnesus]]. The emphasis is given in anatomy, and it is one of the first attempts to represent a kind of motion, and beauty relative to proportions, which appear mostly in post-Archaic art. The statue throws some light on an artistic centre which, with an independently developed harder, simpler, and heavier style, restricts [[Ionia]]n influence in Athens. Finally, this is the germ from which the art of [[Polykleitos]] was to grow two or three generations later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Homann144&quot;&gt;Homann-Wedeking (1966). ''Art of the World. Archaic Greece'' pp. 144-150.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical Sculpture===
[[File:Apollon de Mantoue Louvre MA689.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Apollo of the &quot;Mantoua type&quot;, marble Roman copy after a 5th-century-BC Greek original attributed to [[Polykleitos]], Musée du Louvre]]
In the next century which is the beginning of the [[Classical Greece|Classical period]], it was considered that beauty in visible things as in everything else, consisted of symmetry and proportions. The artists tried also to represent motion in a specific moment ([[Myron]]), which may be considered as the reappearance of the dormant [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] element.&lt;ref name=Schachermeyer242/&gt; Anatomy and geometry are fused in one, and each does something to the other. The Greek sculptors tried to clarify it by looking for mathematical proportions, just as they sought some reality behind appearances. [[Polykleitos]] in his ''Canon'' wrote that beauty consists in the proportion not of the elements (materials), but of the parts, that is the interrelation of parts with one another and with the whole. It seems that he was influenced by the theories of [[Pythagoras]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Each part (finger, palm, arm, etc) transmitted its individual existence to the next, and then to the whole&quot; : ''Canon of [[Polykleitos]]'', also [[Plotinus]], ''Ennead'' I vi. i: Nigel Spivey (1997). ''Greek art'', Phaidon Press Ltd. London. pp. 290-294.&lt;/ref&gt;
The famous ''Apollo of Mantua'' and its variants are early forms of the [[Apollo Citharoedus]] statue type, in which the god holds the [[cithara]] in his left arm. The type is represented by [[neo-Attic]] Imperial Roman copies of the late 1st or early 2nd century, modelled upon a supposed Greek bronze original made in the second quarter of the 5th century BCE, in a style similar to works of [[Polykleitos]] but more archaic. The Apollo held the ''cythara'' against his extended left arm, of which in the Louvre example, a fragment of one twisting scrolling horn upright remains against his biceps.

Though the proportions were always important in Greek art, the appeal of the Greek sculptures eludes any explanation by proportion alone. The statues of Apollo were thought to incarnate his living presence, and these representations of illusive imaginative reality had deep roots in the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] period, and in the beliefs of the first [[Greek language|Greek]] speaking people who entered the region during the bronze-age. Just as the Greeks saw the mountains, forests, sea and rivers as inhabited by concrete beings, so nature in all of its manifestations possesses clear form, and the form of a work of art. Spiritual life is incorporated in matter, when it is given artistic form. Just as in the arts the Greeks sought some reality behind appearances, so in mathematics they sought permanent principles which could be applied wherever the conditions were the same. Artists and sculptors tried to find this ideal order in relation with mathematics, but they believed that this ideal order revealed itself not so much to the dispassionate intellect, as to the whole sentient self.&lt;ref name=Homann63/&gt; Things as we see them, and as they really are, are one, that each stresses the nature of the other in a single unity.

===Pediments and Friezes===
[[File:Apollo west pediment Olympia copy MFA Munich.jpg|thumb|upright|Apollo, West Pediment Olympia. Munich, copy from original, 460 BC at the [[Temple of Zeus]], [[Olympia, Greece]].]]
In the archaic pediments and friezes of the temples, the artists had a problem to fit a group of figures into an isosceles triangle with acute angles at the base.

The [[Siphnian Treasury]] in [[Delphi]] was one of the first Greek buildings utilizing the solution to put the dominating form in the middle, and to complete the descending scale of height with other figures sitting or kneeling. The pediment shows the story of [[Heracles]] stealing Apollo's tripod that was strongly associated with his oracular inspiration. Their two figures hold the centre. In the pediment of the temple of [[Zeus]] in [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], the single figure of Apollo is dominating the scene.&lt;ref name=Bowra144/&gt;

[[File:Part of the Bassae Frieze at the British Museum.jpg|thumb|left|Part of the [[Bassae Frieze]] at the [[British Museum]]. Apollo and Artemis in the northeast corner.]]
These representations rely on presenting scenes directly to the eye for their own visible sake. They care for the schematic arrangements of bodies in space, but only as parts in a larger whole. While each scene has its own character and completeness it must fit into the general sequence to which it belongs. In these archaic pediments the sculptors use empty intervals, to suggest a passage to and fro a busy battlefield. The artists seem to have been dominated by geometrical pattern and order, and this was improved when classical art brought a greater freedom and economy.&lt;ref name=Bowra144/&gt;

===Hellenistic Greece-Rome===
Apollo as a handsome beardless young man, is often depicted with a [[kithara]] (as [[Apollo Citharoedus]]) or bow in his hand, or reclining on a tree (the [[Apollo Lykeios]] and [[Apollo Sauroctonos]] types). The [[Apollo Belvedere]] is a [[marble]] sculpture that was rediscovered in the late 15th century; for centuries it epitomized the ideals of [[Classical Antiquity]] for Europeans, from the [[Renaissance]] through the 19th century. The marble is a [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] or Roman copy of a bronze original by the Greek sculptor [[Leochares]], made between 350 and 325 BCE.

The life-size so-called &quot;[[Adonis]]&quot; found in 1780 on the site of a ''[[Roman villa|villa suburbana]]'' near the [[Via Labicana]] in the Roman suburb of Centocelle is identified as an Apollo by modern scholars. In the late 2nd century CE floor mosaic from [[El Djem]], Roman ''Thysdrus'', he is identifiable as [[Helios|Apollo Helios]] by his effulgent [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], though now even a god's divine [[nudity|nakedness]] is concealed by his cloak, a mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later [[Roman Empire|Empire]].

Another haloed Apollo in mosaic, from [[Hadrumentum]], is in the museum at [[Sousse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080708143541/http://www.tunisiaonline.com/mosaics/mosaic05b.html |title=Mosaics in Tunisia,Apollo and the Muses |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=8 July 2008 |accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conventions of this representation, head tilted, lips slightly parted, large-eyed, curling [[Hairstyle|hair cut]] in locks grazing the neck, were developed in the 3rd century BCE to depict [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;Bieber 1964, Yalouris 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Some time after this mosaic was executed, the earliest depictions of Christ would also be beardless and haloed.

==Modern reception==
[[File:Onthemorningthomas4.jpg|thumb|''The Overthrow of Apollo and the Pagan Gods'', watercolour from [[William Blake's illustrations of On the Morning of Christ's Nativity|William Blake's illustrations of ''On the Morning of Christ's Nativity'']] (1809)]]

Apollo has often featured in postclassical art and literature. [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] composed a &quot;Hymn of Apollo&quot; (1820), and the god's instruction of the Muses formed the subject of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Apollon musagète]]'' (1927–1928).

In discussion of the arts, a distinction is sometimes made between the [[Apollonian and Dionysian]] impulses where the former is concerned with imposing intellectual order and the latter with chaotic creativity. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] argued that a fusion of the two was most desirable. [[Carl Jung]]'s [[Apollo archetype]] represents what he saw as the disposition in people to over-intellectualise and maintain emotional distance.

His four [[Australian Open]] titles are an [[History of tennis#Open Era|Open Era]] record (shared with Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer).

In a passage from the book ''Open'', Agassi details how his father made him play a match for money with football legend [[Jim Brown]], in 1979, when Agassi was 9 years old. Brown was at a Vegas tennis club complaining to the owner about a money match that was canceled. Agassi's father stepped in and told Brown that he could play his son and he would put up his house for the wager. Brown countered with a $10,000 bet, but after he was warned by the club owner not to take the bet because he would lose and be embarrassed, Brown agreed with Mike Agassi that they would set the amount after he and Andre played two sets. Brown lost those sets, 3–6, 3–6, declined the 10K wager, and offered to play the third set for $500. He lost 2–6.&lt;ref name=Open&gt;{{cite book|last=Agassi|first=Andre|title=Open: An Autobiography|year=2010|publisher=Vintage|location=London|isbn=978-0-307-38840-7|pages=50–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International tennis career biography==

===1986–1993===
{{BLP sources section|date=August 2011}}
He turned professional at the age of 16 and competed in his first tournament at [[La Quinta, California]]. He won his first match against [[John Austin (tennis)|John Austin]], but then lost his second match to [[Mats Wilander]]. By the end of the year, Agassi was ranked world no. 91.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tennis28&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tennis28.com/rankings/history/agassi.html|title=Tennis28-Bio:Andre Agassi|accessdate=12 June 2009|publisher=Tennis28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He won his first top-level singles title in 1987 at the [[ATP Itaparica|Sul American Open]] in [[Itaparica]]&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; and ended the year ranked world no. 25.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; He won six additional tournaments in 1988 (Memphis, [[1988 U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships|U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships]], [[World Championship Tennis#WCT 1988|Forest Hills WCT]], Stuttgart Outdoor, [[1988 Volvo International|Volvo International]] and [[1988 Livingston Open|Livingston Open]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; and, by December of that year, he had surpassed US$1&amp;nbsp;million in career prize money after playing in just 43 tournaments—the fastest anyone in history had reached that level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1152468/bio Andre Agassi – Biography&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; During the year, he set the open-era record for most consecutive victories by a male teenager, a record that stood for 17 years until [[Rafael Nadal]] broke it in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Teen Nadal gives Spain reign over French Open|date=5 June 2006|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/french/2005-06-05-day-14_x.htm|agency=Associated Press   (USA Today)|accessdate =6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His year-end ranking was world no. 3, behind second-ranked [[Ivan Lendl]] and top-ranked [[Mats Wilander]]. Both the [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] and ''Tennis'' magazine named Agassi the Most Improved Player of the Year for 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt;

In addition to not playing the Australian Open (which later became his best Grand Slam event) for the first eight years of his career, Agassi chose not to play at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] from 1988 through 1990 and publicly stated that he did not wish to play there because of the event's traditionalism, particularly its &quot;predominantly white&quot; dress code to which players at the event are required to conform.

Strong performances on the tour meant that Agassi was quickly tipped as a future Grand Slam champion. While still a teenager, he reached the semifinals of both the French Open and the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] in 1988 and made the US Open semifinals in 1989. He began the 1990s, however, with a series of near-misses. He reached his first Grand Slam final in 1990 at the French Open, where he was favored before losing in four sets to [[Andrés Gómez]]. He reached his second Grand Slam final of the year at the US Open, defeating defending champion [[Boris Becker]] in the semifinals. His opponent in the final was [[Pete Sampras]]; a year earlier, Agassi had crushed Sampras, after which he told his coach that he felt bad for Sampras because he was never going to make it as a pro. Agassi lost the US Open final to Sampras in three sets.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; The rivalry between these two American players became the dominant rivalry in tennis over the rest of the decade. Also in 1990, Agassi helped the United States win its first [[Davis Cup]] in 8 years and won his only [[Tennis Masters Cup]], beating reigning Wimbledon champion [[Stefan Edberg]] in the final.

In 1991, Agassi reached his second consecutive French Open final, where he faced fellow Bollettieri Academy alumnus [[Jim Courier]]. Courier emerged the victor in a five-set final. Agassi decided to play at Wimbledon in 1991, leading to weeks of speculation in the media about the clothes he would wear. He eventually emerged for the first round in a completely white outfit. He reached the quarterfinals on that occasion, losing in five sets to [[David Wheaton]].

Agassi's Grand Slam tournament breakthrough came at Wimbledon, not at the French Open or the US Open, where he had previously enjoyed success. In 1992, he defeated [[Goran Ivanišević]] in a five-set final.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; Along the way, Agassi overcame two former Wimbledon champions: [[Boris Becker]] and [[John McEnroe]]. No other baseliner would triumph at Wimbledon until [[Lleyton Hewitt]] ten years later. Agassi was named the [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year Overseas Personality|BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year]] in 1992. Agassi once again played on the United States' [[Davis Cup]] winning team in 1992. It was their second Davis cup title in three years.

1993 saw Agassi win the only doubles title of his career, at the [[Cincinnati Masters]], partnered with [[Petr Korda]]. Agassi missed much of the early part of that year with injuries. Although he made the quarterfinals in his Wimbledon title defense, he lost to eventual champion and world no. 1 Pete Sampras in five sets. Agassi lost in the first round at the US Open to [[Thomas Enqvist]] and required wrist surgery late in the year.

===1994–1997===
With new coach [[Brad Gilbert]] on board, Agassi began to employ more of a tactical, consistent approach, which fueled his resurgence. He started slowly in 1994, losing in the first week at the French Open and Wimbledon. Nevertheless, he emerged during the hard-court season, winning the [[Canada Masters|Canadian Open]]. His comeback culminated at the [[1994 US Open (tennis)|1994 US Open]] with a five-set fourth-round victory against compatriot [[Michael Chang]]. He then became the first man to capture the US Open as an [[Seed (tennis)|unseeded]] player, beating [[Michael Stich]] in the final.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt;

In 1995, Agassi shaved his balding head, breaking with his old &quot;image is everything&quot; style. He competed in the [[1995 Australian Open]] (his first appearance at the event) and won, beating Sampras in a four-set final.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; Agassi and Sampras met in five tournament finals in 1995, all on [[hardcourt]], with Agassi winning three. Agassi won three Masters Series events in 1995 ([[Cincinnati Masters|Cincinnati]], [[Miami Masters|Key Biscayne]], and the Canadian Open) and seven titles total.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; He compiled a career-best 26-match winning streak during the summer hard-court circuit, which ended when he lost the [[1995 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] final to Sampras.

Agassi reached the [[List of ATP number 1 ranked players|world no. 1]] ranking for the first time in April 1995. He held that ranking until November, for a total of 30 weeks. In terms of win/loss record, 1995 was Agassi's best year. He won 73 matches and lost 9. Agassi was also once again a key player on the United States' [[Davis Cup]] winning team—the third and final Davis Cup title of Agassi's career.

1996 was a less successful year for Agassi, as he failed to reach any Grand Slam final. He suffered two early-round losses at the hands of compatriots [[Chris Woodruff]] and [[Doug Flach]] at the French Open and Wimbledon, respectively, and lost to Chang in straight sets in the Australian and US Open semifinals. At the time, Agassi blamed the Australian Open loss on the windy conditions, but later said in his biography that he had lost the match on purpose, as he did not want to play [[Boris Becker]], whom he would have faced in that final. The high point for Agassi was winning the men's singles gold medal at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] in [[Atlanta]], beating [[Sergi Bruguera]] of Spain in the final.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt;  Agassi also successfully defended his singles titles in Cincinnati and Key Biscayne.

1997 was the low point of Agassi's career. His wrist injury resurfaced, and he played only 24 matches during the year. He later confessed that he started using [[methamphetamine|crystal methamphetamine]] at that time, allegedly on the urging of a friend.&lt;ref name=&quot;sports.espn.go.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=4600027|title=Andre Agassi book says he used crystal meth|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=27 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He failed an ATP drug test, but wrote a letter claiming the same friend had spiked a drink. The ATP dropped the failed drug test as a warning. In his autobiography, Agassi admitted that the letter was a lie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/8329193.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Agassi admits use of crystal meth|date=28 October 2009|accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He quit the drug soon after. At this time Agassi was also in a failing marriage with actress [[Brooke Shields]] and had lost interest in the game.&lt;ref&gt;Andre Agassi interview. ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]''. 19 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He won no top-level titles, and his ranking sank to world no. 141 on 10 November 1997, prompting many to believe that his run as one of the sport's premier competitors was over and that he would never again win any significant championships.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt;

===1998–2003===
[[File:Agassi-Auopen2005.jpg|thumb|Agassi serving]]
In 1998, Agassi began a rigorous conditioning program and worked his way back up the rankings by playing in Challenger Series tournaments, a circuit for pro players ranked outside the world's top 50. He also played classic matches in this period against [[Pete Sampras]] and [[Patrick Rafter]].

In 1998, Agassi won five titles and leapt from world no. 110 to no. 6, the highest jump into the top 10 made by any player during a calendar year.&lt;ref name=&quot;atpbio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atptennis.com/5/en/players/playerprofiles/highlights.asp?playernumber=A092|title=Andre Agassi player profile|publisher=Atptennis.com|accessdate=6 June 2011| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20110608193305/http://www.atptennis.com/5/en/players/playerprofiles/highlights.asp?playernumber=A092| archivedate= 8 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Wimbledon, he had an early loss in the second round to [[Tommy Haas]]. He won five titles in ten finals and was runner-up at the [[Miami Masters|Masters Series tournament in Key Biscayne]], losing to [[Marcelo Ríos]], who became world no. 1 as a result.

Agassi entered the history books in 1999 when he came back from two sets to love down to beat [[Andrei Medvedev]] in a five-set French Open final, becoming, at the time, only the fifth male player (joining [[Rod Laver]], [[Fred Perry]], [[Roy Emerson]] and [[Don Budge]]—these have since been joined by a sixth, [[Roger Federer]] and a seventh, [[Rafael Nadal]]) to win all four Grand Slam singles titles during his career. Only Laver, Agassi, Federer and Nadal have achieved this feat during the [[History of tennis#Open Era|open era]]. This win also made him the first (of only three, the second and third being [[Roger Federer]] and [[Rafael Nadal]] respectively) male player in history to have won all four Grand Slam titles on three different surfaces (clay, grass and hard courts), a tribute to his adaptability, as the other four men won their Grand Slam titles on clay and grass courts. Agassi also became the first (of only two, the second being [[Rafael Nadal]]) male player to win the [[Career Golden Slam]], consisting of all four Grand Slam tournaments plus an Olympic gold medal.

Agassi followed his 1999 French Open victory by reaching the Wimbledon final, where he lost to Sampras in straight sets.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; He rebounded from his Wimbledon defeat by winning the [[1999 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], beating [[Todd Martin]] in five sets (rallying from a two sets to one deficit) in the final. Agassi ended 1999 as the world no. 1, ending Sampras's record of six consecutive year-ending top rankings (1993–1998).&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt;  This was the only time Agassi ended the year at no. 1.

He began the next year by capturing his second Australian Open title, beating Sampras in a five-set semifinal and [[Yevgeny Kafelnikov]] in a four-set final.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; He was the first male player to have reached four consecutive Grand Slam finals since [[Rod Laver]] achieved the Grand Slam in 1969.{{#tag:ref|[[Roger Federer]] has since surpassed this feat, reaching ten consecutive Grand Slam finals from 2005–2007.|group=lower-alpha}}  At the time, Agassi was also only the fourth player since Laver to be the reigning champion of three of four Grand Slam events, missing only the Wimbledon title.{{#tag:ref|[[Pete Sampras]] held the 1993 Wimbledon, 1993 [[1993 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] and [[1994 Australian Open]] titles simultaneously.  [[Jimmy Connors]] (1974), [[Roger Federer]] (2004, 2006 and 2007) and [[Novak Djokovic]] (2011) won those three Majors in the same year, although Connors' Grand Slam titles were all played on [[Tennis court#Grass courts|grass courts]].  [[Mats Wilander]] won all but Wimbledon in 1988 during his similar rise to the year-end world no. 1.  [[Rafael Nadal]] won the French Open and Wimbledon &quot;Channel Slam&quot; (2008) and 2009 Australian Open, before replicating the Channel Slam alongside winning the US Open in 2010.|group=lower-alpha}}

2000 also saw Agassi reach the semifinals at Wimbledon, where he lost in five sets to Rafter in a match considered by many to be one of the best ever at Wimbledon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/wimbledon_history/3742067.stm|title=Classic Matches: Rafter v Agassi|date=31 May 2004|accessdate=25 October 2007|publisher=BBC Sport|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mr2GUooH|archivedate = 17 January 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the inaugural [[2000 Tennis Masters Cup|Tennis Masters Cup]] in Lisbon, Agassi reached the final after defeating [[Marat Safin]] in the semifinals to end the Russian's hopes to become the youngest world no. 1 in the history of tennis. Agassi then lost to [[Gustavo Kuerten]] in the final, allowing Kuerten to be crowned year-end world no. 1.

Agassi opened 2001 by successfully defending his Australian Open title with a straight-sets final win over [[Arnaud Clément]].&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; En route, he beat a cramping Rafter in five sets in front of a sell-out crowd in what turned out to be the Aussie's last Australian Open. At Wimbledon, they met again in the semifinals, where Agassi lost another close match to Rafter, 8–6 in the fifth set. In the quarterfinals at the US Open, Agassi lost a 3 hour, 33&amp;nbsp;minute epic match&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/tennis/2001/us_open/news/2001/09/05/sampras_agassi|title=Believe the hype|work=Sports Illustrated|date=6 September 2001|accessdate=6 June 2011| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20110604013156/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/tennis/2001/us_open/news/2001/09/05/sampras_agassi| archivedate= 4 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Sampras, 7–6, 6–7, 6–7, 6–7,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/tennis/2001/us_open/news/2001/09/05/agassi_sidebar_ap|title=Unbreakable|date=6 September 2001|work=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with no breaks of serve during the 48-game match. Despite the setback, Agassi finished 2001 ranked world no. 3, becoming the only male tennis player to finish a year ranked in the top 3 in three different decades&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsline.com/tennis/players/playerpage/201490/2006|title=SportsLine:Andre Agassi|year=2006|publisher=Sportsline|accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1980s—finishing world no. 3 in 1988 and no. 7 in 1989; 1990s—finishing world no. 4 in 1990, no. 10 in 1991, no. 9 in 1992, no. 2 in 1994 and 1995, no. 8 in 1996, no. 6 in 1998 and no. 1 in 1999; 2000s—finishing world no. 6 in 2000, no. 3 in 2001, no. 2 in 2002, no. 4 in 2003, no. 8 in 2004 and no. 7 in 2005). He also was the oldest player (age 31) to finish in the top three since 32-year old Connors finished at world no. 2 in 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;atpbio&quot; /&gt;

2002 opened with disappointment for Agassi, as injury forced him to skip the Australian Open, where he was a two-time defending champion. The last duel between Agassi and Sampras came in the final of the US Open, which Sampras won in four sets and left Sampras with a 20–14 edge in their 34 career meetings. The match was the last of Sampras's career. Agassi's US Open finish, along with his Masters Series victories in Key Biscayne, [[Rome Masters|Rome]] and [[Madrid Masters|Madrid]], helped him finish 2002 as the oldest year-end world no. 2 at 32 years and 8 months.&lt;ref name=&quot;atpbio&quot; /&gt;

In 2003, Agassi won the eighth (and final) Grand Slam title of his career at the Australian Open, where he beat [[Rainer Schüttler]] in straight sets in the final. In March, he won his sixth career and third consecutive [[Key Biscayne]] title, in the process surpassing his wife, [[Steffi Graf]], who was a five-time winner of the event. The final was his 18th straight win in that tournament, which broke the previous record of 17 set by Sampras from 1993–1995. (Agassi's winning streak continued to 20 after winning his first two matches at the 2004 edition of that tournament before bowing to [[Agustín Calleri]].) With the victory, Agassi became the youngest (19 years old) and oldest (32) winner of the Key Biscayne tournament.

On 28 April 2003, he recaptured the world no. 1 ranking after a quarterfinal victory over [[Xavier Malisse]] at the [[Queen's Club Championships]] to become the oldest top-ranked male player since the ATP rankings began at 33 years and 13 days. He had held the world no. 1 ranking for two weeks, when [[Lleyton Hewitt]] took it back on 12 May 2003. Agassi then recaptured the world no. 1 ranking once again on 16 June 2003, which he held for 12 weeks until 7 September 2003. During his career, Agassi held the world no. 1 ranking for a total of 101 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tenniscorner.net/index.php?corner=m&amp;action=stats&amp;stats=no1|title=Weeks at Number One|publisher=TennisCorner.net|accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agassi's ranking slipped when injuries forced him to withdraw from many events. He did manage to reach the US Open semifinals, where he lost to [[Juan Carlos Ferrero]] and surrendered his world no. 1 ranking to Ferrero. At the year-end Tennis Masters Cup, Agassi lost in the final to Federer and finished the year ranked world no. 4. At age 33, he was the oldest player to rank in the top 5 since Connors, at age 35, was world no. 4 in 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;atpbio&quot; /&gt;

===2004–2006===
In 2004, Agassi began the year with a five-set loss in the semifinals of the Australian Open to [[Marat Safin]]; the loss ended Agassi's 26-match winning streak at the event, a record that still stands. He won the [[Cincinnati Masters|Masters series event in Cincinnati]] to bring his career total to 59 top-level singles titles and a record 17 ATP Masters Series titles, having already won seven of the nine ATP Masters tournament—all except the tournaments in [[Monte Carlo Masters|Monte Carlo]] and [[Hamburg Masters|Hamburg]]. At 34, he became the second-oldest singles champion in Cincinnati tournament history (the tournament began in 1899), surpassed only by [[Ken Rosewall]], who won the title in 1970 at age 35. He finished the year ranked world no. 8, the oldest player to finish in the top 10 since the 36-year-old Connors was world no. 7 in 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;atpbio&quot; /&gt; Agassi also became only the sixth male player during the [[Tennis open era|open era]] to reach 800 career wins with his first-round victory over [[Alex Bogomolov]] in [[Countrywide Classic]] in Los Angeles.

Agassi's 2005 began with a quarterfinal loss to Federer at the Australian Open. Agassi had several other deep runs at tournaments, but had to withdraw from several events due to injury. He lost to [[Jarkko Nieminen]] in the first round of the French Open. He won his fourth title in Los Angeles and reached the final of the [[Canada Masters|Rogers Cup]], before falling to world no. 2 [[Rafael Nadal]]. Agassi's 2005 was defined by an improbable run to the US Open final. After beating [[Răzvan Sabău]] and [[Ivo Karlović]] in straight sets and [[Tomáš Berdych]] in four sets, Agassi won three consecutive five-set matches to advance to the final. The most notable of these matches was his quarterfinal victory over [[James Blake (tennis)|James Blake]], where he rallied from two sets down to win 7–6 in the fifth set. His other five-set victims were [[Xavier Malisse]] in the fourth round and [[Robby Ginepri]] in the semifinals. In the final, Agassi faced Federer, who was seeking his second consecutive US Open title and his sixth Grand Slam title in two years. Federer defeated Agassi in four sets.

Before the 2005 Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai, Agassi rolled his ankle in a [[racquetball]] accident and tore several ligaments. He was unable to walk for weeks. He nevertheless committed to the tournament, in which he was seeded third, and played [[Nikolay Davydenko]] in his first round-robin match. Agassi's movement was noticeably hindered, particularly on his backhand return of serve, and he lost in straight sets. He then withdrew from the tournament. Agassi finished 2005 ranked world no. 7, his 16th time in the year-end top-10 rankings, which tied Connors for the most times ranked in the top 10 at year's end.

On 25 July 2005 Agassi left [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] after 17 years and signed an endorsement deal with [[Adidas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=2116135|title=Agassi signs Adidas deal after long-term deal with Nike|author=Darren Rovell|date=25 July 2005|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A major reason for Agassi leaving Nike was because Nike refused to donate to Agassi's charities, and Adidas was more than happy to do so. On 13 May 2013 Agassi rejoined Nike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tennis.si.com/2013/05/14/andre-agassi-nike-commercials/|title=Andre Agassi re-signs with Nike: A look back at his memorable commercials|publisher=Sports Illustrated|date=14 May 2013|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nicekicks.com/2013/05/13/andre-agassi-rejoins-nike/|title=Andre Asassi Rejoins Nike|author=Brittany Shelton|publisher=NiceKicks|date=13 May 2013|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/2013/05/14/Marketing-and-Sponsorship/Agassi.aspx|title=Back Home: Andre Agassi Returns To Nike After Eight Years With Adidas|publisher=Street &amp; Smith|date=14 May 2013|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agassi had a poor start to 2006. He was still recovering from an ankle injury and also suffering from back and leg pain and lack of match play. Agassi withdrew from the Australian Open because of the ankle injury, and his back injury and other pains forced him to withdraw from several other events, eventually skipping the entire clay-court season, including the French Open. This caused his ranking to drop out of the top 10 for the last time.

Agassi returned for the grass-court season, playing a tune-up, and then [[2006 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles|Wimbledon]]. He was defeated in the third round by world no. 2 (and eventual runner-up) [[Rafael Nadal]]. Against conventions, Agassi, the losing player, was interviewed on court after the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13653101|title=Upsetting day: Agassi, then Roddick ousted|date=1 June 2006|accessdate=27 October 2007|agency=Associated Press|publisher=NBC Sports| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20071105214848/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13653101| archivedate= 5 November 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Wimbledon, Agassi announced his plans to retire following the US Open.

Agassi played only two events during the summer hard-court season, with his best result being a quarterfinal loss at the [[Countrywide Classic]] in Los Angeles to [[Fernando González]] of Chile. As a result, he was unseeded at the US Open.

Agassi had a short, but dramatic, run in his final US Open. Because of extreme back pain, Agassi was forced to receive anti-inflammatory injections after every match. After a tough four-set win against [[Andrei Pavel]], Agassi faced eighth-seeded [[Marcos Baghdatis]] in the second round, who had earlier advanced to the [[2006 Australian Open]] final and Wimbledon semifinals. Agassi won in five tough sets as the younger Baghdatis succumbed to muscle cramping in the final set. In his last match, Agassi fell to 112th-ranked big-serving [[Benjamin Becker]] of Germany in four sets. Agassi received a four-minute standing ovation from the crowd after the match and delivered a retirement speech.

===Earnings===
Agassi earned more than US$30&amp;nbsp;million in prize-money during his career, fifth only to Federer, Nadal, Djokovic and Sampras to date. He also earned more than US$25&amp;nbsp;million a year through endorsements during his career, fourth in all sports at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/lists/2005/53/1YUQ.html|title=Forbes:Andre Agassi|work=Forbes|accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-retirement===
Since retiring after the [[2006 US Open (tennis)|2006 US Open]], Agassi has participated in a series of charity tournaments and continues his work with his own charity. On 5 September 2007, he was a surprise guest commentator for the [[Andy Roddick]]/[[Roger Federer]] [[2007 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] quarter-final. He played an exhibition match at Wimbledon, teaming with his wife, Steffi Graf, to play with [[Tim Henman]] and [[Kim Clijsters]]. He played [[World Team Tennis]] for the [[Philadelphia Freedoms]] in the summer of 2009&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/tennis/02/26/agassi.ap/index.html Andre Agassi Will Play WTT] SI.com, 1 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and played at the [[Outback Champions Series]] event for the first time. He played the [[Cancer Treatment Centers of America Championship at Surprise|Cancer Treatment Centers of America Tennis Championships]] at [[Surprise, Arizona]], where he reached the final before bowing to eventual champion [[Todd Martin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.championsseriestennis.com/events/event-results/|title=Champions Series Tennis – Arizona 2009|year=2009|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the way to the final, Agassi beat [[Mikael Pernfors]] in the quarter-finals and [[Wayne Ferreira]] in the semi-finals. He also announced that he will not be playing the tour on a full-time basis, and played the tournament as a favor to long-time friend [[Jim Courier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/tennis/story/12343241|title=Agassi reaches Outback Champions Series final|publisher=CBS Sports|accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[2009 French Open]], Agassi was on hand to present [[Roger Federer]], who completed his Career Grand Slam by winning the tournament and joined Agassi as one of six men to complete the Career Grand Slam, with the trophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2009/jun/07/roger-federer-wins-french-open Roger Federer beats Robin Soderling to win French Open tennis | Sport | guardian.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing style==
Early in his career, Agassi would look to end points quickly by playing first strike tennis, typically by inducing a weak return with a deep, hard shot, and then playing a winner at an extreme angle. His groundstrokes, return of serve, baseline game, phenomenal hand-eye coordination and keen sense of anticipation were always among the best in the game. On the rare occasion that he charged the net, Agassi liked to take the ball in the air and hit a swinging volley for the winner. His favored groundstroke was his flat, laser-accurate two-handed backhand, hit well cross-court but in particular down the line. His slightly spinnier forehand was nearly as strong, in particular his inside-out forehand to the ad court.{{according to whom|date=July 2013}}{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Agassi's strength was in dictating play from the back of the court. While he was growing up, his father and Nick Bollettieri trained him in this way.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Open: Andre Agassi HarpersCollins 2009&lt;/ref&gt; When in control of a point, Agassi would often pass up an opportunity to attempt a winner and hit a conservative shot to minimize his errors, and to make his opponent run more. This change to more methodical, less aggressive baseline play was largely initiated by his longtime coach, Brad Gilbert, in their first year together in 1994. Gilbert encouraged Agassi to wear out opponents with his deep, flat groundstrokes and to use his fitness to win attrition wars, and noted Agassi's two-handed backhand down the line as his very best shot.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Agassi's serve was never the strength of his game, but it improved steadily over the course of his career to being above average. He often used his hard slice serve to the deuce service box to send his opponent off the court, followed by a shot to the opposite corner. Agassi's service speed when hitting a flat first serve would range between {{convert|110|and|125|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. His second serve usually was a heavy &quot;kick&quot; serve in the mid-80s range.{{according to whom|date=July 2013}}{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Agassi was raised on hardcourts, but found much of his early major-tournament success on the red clay of Roland Garros, reaching two consecutive finals there early in his career. His first major win, however, was at the slick grass of Wimbledon in 1992, a tournament that he professed to hating at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; His strongest surface over the course of his career, however, was indeed hardcourt, where he won six of his eight majors.

==Personal and family life==
In the early 90's Agassi dated American entertainer [[Barbra Streisand]]. Writing about the relationship in his 2009 autobiography, he said: We agree that we're good for each other, and so what if she's twenty-eight years older? We're simpatico, and the public outcry only adds spice to our connection. It makes our friendship feel forbidden, taboo &amp;ndash; another piece of my overall rebellion. Dating Barbra Streisand is like wearing Hot Lava.&quot;

Agassi was married to [[Brooke Shields]] from 1997 to 1999. He married [[Steffi Graf]] on 22 October 2001; four days later, their son, Jaden Gil, was born. Their daughter, Jaz Elle, was born in October 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knolle|first=Sharon|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=101751&amp;page=1|title=Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf Wed|publisher=Abcnews.go.com|accessdate=6 June 2011| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20110522145516/http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=101751&amp;page=1| archivedate= 22 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agassi has said that he and Graf are not pushing their children toward becoming tennis players.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10861440 &quot;Tennis: Agassi taking different tact with fatherhood,&quot;] The New Zealand Herald, 25 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-time trainer [[Gil Reyes (tennis)|Gil Reyes]] has been called one of Agassi's closest friends; some have described him as being a &quot;father figure&quot; to Agassi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/1999/year_in_review/flashbacks/father_best/|title=Father Knew Best|work=Sports Illustrated|accessdate =26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://safinhantuchova.blogspot.com/2008/07/papa-gil.html|title=Peter Bodo Blog: Papa Gil|accessdate =26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Agassi and Reyes introduced their own line of fitness equipment, BILT By Agassi and Reyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thepostgame.com/blog/training-day/201209/bilt-andre-agassi-gil-reyes-fitness-gym-equipment-safety|title=Andre Agassi and Trainer Introduce Their Personalized Fitness Equipment to the Public|work=ThePostGame.com|accessdate =7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, Agassi's childhood friend and former business manager, Perry Rogers, sued Graf for $50,000 in management fees he claimed that she owed him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.lasvegassun.com/media/pdfs/blogs/documents/2008/12/06/Complaint_and_Summons.pdf ''Alliance Sports Management v.

Agassi has donated more than $100,000 to Democratic candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmeat.com/sports_political_donations/Andre_Agassi.php|title=Andre Agassi's Federal Campaign Contribution Report|publisher=NewsMeat|accessdate =26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 1 September 2010, when he appeared on daily WNYC public radio program &quot;The Brian Lehrer Show,&quot; he stated that he is a registered Independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beta.wnyc.org/shows/bl/2010/sep/01/net-effects/|title=Andre Agassi: Net Effects|publisher=&quot;The Brian Lehrer Show&quot;|accessdate =26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Agassi founded the Andre Agassi Charitable Association in 1994, which assists Las Vegas' young people. He was awarded the ATP Arthur Ashe Humanitarian award in 1995 for his efforts to help disadvantaged youth. He is regularly cited as the most charitable and socially involved player in professional tennis. It has also been claimed that he may be the most charitable athlete of his generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackvoices.com/black_sports/columnists/roysjohnson/_a/sportsmanperson-of-the-year/20061002123009990001|title=Sportsman/Person of the Year|accessdate =26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agassi's charities help in assisting children reach their athletic potential. His Boys &amp; Girls Club sees 2,000 children throughout the year and boasts a world-class junior tennis team. It also has a basketball program (the Agassi Stars) and a rigorous system that encourages a mix of academics and athletics.

In 2001, Agassi opened the Andre Agassi College Preparatory Academy&lt;ref name=Prep&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agassiprep.org|title=Andre Agassi College Preparatory Academy|accessdate=26 January 2011| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20110211235357/http://agassiprep.org/| archivedate= 11 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Las Vegas, a tuition-free charter school for at-risk children in the area.

In 1997, Agassi donated funding to Child Haven for a six-room classroom building now named the Agassi Center for Education. His foundation also provided $720,000 to assist in the building of the Andre Agassi Cottage for Medically Fragile Children. This 20-bed facility opened in December 2001, and accommodates developmentally delayed or handicapped children and children quarantined for infectious diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athlete.com/profile.php?id=351|title=Andre Agassi|publisher=Athlete.com|accessdate=6 June 2011| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20110707182451/http://www.athlete.com/profile.php?id=351| archivedate= 7 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Austroasiatic languages''',&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes also as '''Austro-Asiatic''' or '''Austroasian'''.&lt;/ref&gt; in recent classifications synonymous with '''Mon–Khmer''',&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2012) notes, ''MK in the wider sense including the Munda languages of eastern South Asia is also known as Austroasiatic.''&lt;/ref&gt; are a large [[language family]] of continental Southeast Asia, also scattered throughout India, [[Bangladesh]], and the southern border of China. The name ''Austroasiatic'' comes from the [[Latin]] words for &quot;south&quot; and &quot;Asia&quot;, hence &quot;South Asia&quot;. Among these languages, only [[Khmer language|Khmer]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], and [[Mon language|Mon]] have a long-established [[recorded history]], and only Vietnamese and Khmer have official status (in [[Vietnam]] and [[Cambodia]], respectively). The rest of the languages are spoken by minority groups. ''[[Ethnologue]]'' identifies 168 Austroasiatic languages. These form thirteen established families (plus perhaps [[Shompen language|Shompen]], which is poorly attested, as a fourteenth), which have traditionally been grouped into two, as [[Mon–Khmer languages|Mon–Khmer]] and [[Munda languages|Munda]]. However, one recent classification posits three groups (Munda, Nuclear Mon-Khmer and  [[Khasi–Khmuic languages|Khasi-Khmuic]])&lt;ref&gt;Diffloth 2005&lt;/ref&gt; while another has abandoned Mon–Khmer as a taxon altogether, making it synonymous with the larger family.&lt;ref&gt;Sidwell 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Austroasiatic languages have a disjunct distribution across India, Bangladesh and Southeast Asia, separated by regions where other languages are spoken. They appear to be the [[autochthonous language]]s of Southeast Asia, with the neighboring [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indic]], [[Tai languages|Tai]], [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]], [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]], and [[Tibeto-Burman]] languages being the result of later migrations (Sidwell &amp; Blench, 2011). Genetic studies of representatives from all branches of Austroasiatic indicate the ancestors of Austroasiatic speakers originated in present-day India and migrated into Southeast Asia from the [[Brahmaputra River]] Valley.&lt;ref&gt;2007. Reddy, Battini M., et al. [http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/47 &quot;Y-chromosome evidence suggests a common paternal heritage of Austro-Asiatic populations&quot;]. BMC Journal of Evolutionary Biology 7:47&lt;/ref&gt;

== Typology ==
{{Expand section|date=November 2010}}

The Austroasiatic languages are well known for having a [[sesquisyllable|&quot;sesquisyllabic&quot;]] pattern, with basic nouns and verbs consisting of a reduced [[minor syllable]] plus a full syllable. Many of them also have [[infix]]es. The Austroasiatic languages are further characterized as having unusually large vowel inventories and employing some sort of [[Register (phonology)|register]] contrast, either between [[modal voice|modal]] (normal) voice and [[breathy voice|breathy]] (lax) voice or between modal voice and [[creaky voice]].&lt;ref&gt;DIPFLOTH, Gerard. [http://www.sealang.net/archives/mks/pdf/15:139-154.pdf &quot;Proto-Austroasiatic creaky voice.&quot;] (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; Languages in the Pearic branch and some in the Vietic branch can have a three- or even four-way voicing contrast. However, some Austroasiatic languages have lost the register contrast by evolving more diphthongs or in a few cases, such as Vietnamese, [[tonogenesis]].

==Proto-language==
{{Main|Proto-Mon–Khmer language}}

Much work has been done on the reconstruction of [[Proto-Mon–Khmer]] in [[Harry L. Shorto]]'s ''Mon–Khmer Comparative Dictionary''. Little work has been done on the [[Munda languages]], which are not well documented; with their demotion from a primary branch,{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Proto-Mon–Khmer becomes synonymous with Proto-Austroasiatic.

Sidwell (2005) reconstructs the consonant inventory of Proto-Mon–Khmer as follows:

{| class=&quot;IPA wikitable&quot;
|-
|*p||*t||*c||*k||*ʔ
|-
|*b||*d||*ɟ||*ɡ||
|-
|*ɓ||*ɗ||*ʄ|| ||
|-
|*m||*n||*ɲ||*ŋ||
|-
|*w||*l, *r||*j|| ||
|-
| ||*s|| || ||*h
|}

This is identical to earlier reconstructions except for {{IPA|*ʄ}}.  {{IPA|*ʄ}} is better preserved in the [[Katuic languages]], which Sidwell has specialized in. Sidwell (2011) suggests that the likely homeland of Austroasiatic is the middle [[Mekong]], in the area of the Bahnaric and Katuic languages (approximately where modern Laos, Thailand, and Cambodia come together), and that the family is not as old as frequently assumed, dating to perhaps 2000 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;SidwellBlench2011&quot;/&gt;

==Classification==
Linguists traditionally recognize two primary divisions of Austroasiatic: the Mon–Khmer languages of Southeast Asia, [[North-East India|Northeast India]] and the [[Nicobar Islands]], and the Munda languages of [[East India|East]] and Central India and parts of Bangladesh. However, no evidence for this classification has ever been published.

Each of the families that is written in boldface type below is accepted as a valid clade. By contrast, the relationships ''between'' these families within Austroasiatic is debated. In addition to the traditional classification, two recent proposals are given, neither of which accept traditional &quot;Mon–Khmer&quot; as a valid unit. However, little of the data used for competing classifications has ever been published, and therefore cannot be evaluated by peer review.

In addition, there are suggestions that additional branches of Austroasiatic might be preserved in substrata of [[Acehnese language|Acehnese]] in Sumatra (Diffloth), the [[Chamic languages]] of Vietnam, and the [[Land Dayak languages]] of Borneo (Adelaar 1995).&lt;ref&gt;Roger Blench, ''2009. Are there four additional unrecognised branches of Austroasiatic?'' Presentation at ICAAL-4, Bangkok, 29–30 October. Summarized in Sidwell and Blench (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sidwell (2009, 2011)===
Sidwell (2009a), in a [[lexicostatistical]] comparison of 36 languages which are well-known enough to exclude loan words, finds little evidence for internal branching, though he did find an area of increased contact between the Bahnaric and Katuic languages, such that languages of all branches apart from the geographically distant Munda and Nicobarese show greater similarity to Bahnaric and Katuic the closer they are to those branches, without any noticeable innovations common to Bahnaric and Katuic. He therefore takes the conservative view that the thirteen branches of Austroasiatic should be treated as equidistant on current evidence. Sidwell &amp; Blench (2011) discuss this proposal in more detail, and note that there is good evidence for a Khasi–Palaungic node, which could also possibly be closely related to Khmuic.&lt;ref name=&quot;SidwellBlench2011&quot;&gt;Sidwell, Paul, and Roger Blench. 2011. &quot;The Austroasiatic Urheimat: the Southeastern Riverine Hypothesis.&quot; Enfield, N.J. (ed.) ''Dynamics of Human Diversity'', 317-345. Canberra: Pacific Linguistics. http://rogerblench.info/Archaeology/SE%20Asia/SR09/Sidwell%20Blench%20offprint.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; If this would the case, Sidwell &amp; Blench suggest that Khasic may have been an early offshoot of Palaungic that had spread westward. Sidwell &amp; Blench (2011) suggest [[Shompen language|Shompen]] as an additional branch, and believe that a Vieto-Katuic connection is worth investigating. In general, however, the family is thought to have diversified too quickly for a deeply nested structure to have developed, since Proto-Austroasiatic speakers are believed by Sidwell to have radiated out from the central [[Mekong]] River valley relatively quickly.

===Ilia Peiros (2004)===
Peiros is a [[lexicostatistics|lexicostatistic]] classification, based on percentages of shared vocabulary. This means that a language may appear to be more distantly related than it actually is due to [[language contact]]. Indeed, when Sidwell (2009a) replicated Peiros's study with languages known well enough to account for loans, he did not find the internal (branching) structure below.

==Writing systems==
Other than Latin-based alphabets, many Austroasiatic languages are written with the ancient Khmer alphabet, [[Thai alphabet]] and [[Lao alphabet]]. Vietnamese divergently had an indigenous script based on Chinese logographic writing. This has since been supplanted by the Latin alphabet in the 20th century.

'''Afroasiatic''' ('''Afro-Asiatic'''), also known as '''Afrasian''' and traditionally '''Hamito-Semitic''' (Chamito-Semitic),&lt;ref name=&quot;Nanjira&quot;&gt;Daniel Don Nanjira, ''[http://books.google.ca/books?id=LZuxGsXVPoMC&amp;pg=PA52#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false African Foreign Policy and Diplomacy: From Antiquity to the 21st Century]'', (ABC-CLIO: 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; is a large [[language family]], of several hundred related languages and dialects. There are about 300 or so living languages and dialects, according to the 2009 [[Ethnologue]] estimate.&lt;ref name=&quot;ethnologue.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=52-16 Ethnologue family tree for Afroasiatic languages]&lt;/ref&gt; It includes languages spoken predominantly in the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], the [[Horn of Africa]], and parts of the [[Sahel]]. The Afro-Asiatic family is significant to the field of [[historical linguistics]] as possessing the longest [[recorded history]] of any language family.

Afro-Asiatic languages are spoken by almost 362 million native speakers, the third largest number of any language family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/statistics/family Summary by language family]&lt;/ref&gt; The most widely spoken Afroasiatic language is [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (including literary Arabic and the spoken [[varieties of Arabic|colloquial varieties]]), with about 200 to 230 million native speakers, spoken mostly in the Middle East and parts of North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=PxJrB_OKn04C&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA27,M1 Languages of the World]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Berber languages|Berber]] (including all its varieties) is spoken in [[Morocco]], Algeria, [[Libya]], Tunisia, northern [[Mali]], and northern [[Niger]] by about 25 to 35 million people.

In addition to languages spoken today, Afroasiatic includes several important ancient languages, such as [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]], [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], [[Biblical Hebrew]], and [[Aramaic]]. Several [[Afroasiatic_languages#Position_among_the_world.27s_languages|disputed proposals]] link Afro-Asiatic as a whole or certain parts of its branches to other major language families.

==Etymology==
The Afroasiatic language family was originally referred to as &quot;[[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]]ito-[[Shem|Sem]]itic&quot;, a term introduced in the 1860s by the German scholar [[Karl Richard Lepsius]].&lt;ref name=NEB&gt;{{cite book|first=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|title=The New Encyclopædia Britannica, Volume 8; Volume 22|year=1998|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|isbn=0-85229-633-9|pages=722|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=6-lMAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was later popularized by [[Friedrich Müller (linguist)|Friedrich Müller]] in his ''Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft'' (Wien 1876-88).&lt;ref name=&quot;Lipiński&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Lipiński|first=Edward|title=Semitic Languages: Outline of a Comparative Grammar|year=2001|publisher=Peeters Publishers|isbn=90-429-0815-7|pages=21–22|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=IiXVqyEkPKcC&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;Afroasiatic&quot; (often now spelled as &quot;Afro-Asiatic&quot;) was later coined by [[Maurice Delafosse]] (1914). However, it did not come into general use until [[Joseph Greenberg]] (1963) formally proposed its adoption. In doing so, Greenberg sought to emphasize the fact that Afroasiatic was the only language family that was represented transcontinentally, in both Africa and Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lipiński&quot; /&gt;

Individual scholars have also called the family &quot;Erythraean&quot; (Tucker 1966) and &quot;Lisramic&quot; (Hodge 1972). In lieu of &quot;Hamito-Semitic&quot;, the Russian linguist [[Igor Diakonoff]] later suggested the term &quot;Afrasian&quot;, meaning &quot;half African, half Asiatic&quot;, in reference to the geographic distribution of the family's constituent languages.&lt;ref name=NEB/&gt;

The term &quot;Hamito-Semitic&quot; remains in use in the academic traditions of some European countries.

==Distribution and branches==
[[Image:afroasiatic.svg|thumb|right|500px|Some linguists' proposals for grouping within Afroasiatic]]
The Afroasiatic language family is usually considered to include the following branches:
* [[Berber languages|Berber]]
* [[Chadic languages|Chadic]]
* [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]]
* [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]
* [[Omotic languages|Omotic]]
* [[Semitic languages|Semitic]]

While there is general agreement on these six families, there are some points of disagreement among [[linguistics|linguists]] who study Afroasiatic. In particular:
* The [[Omotic]] language branch is the most controversial member of Afroasiatic, since the grammatical formatives which most linguists have given greatest weight in classifying languages in the family &quot;are either absent or distinctly wobbly&quot; (Hayward 1995). Greenberg (1963) and others considered it a subgroup of Cushitic, while others have raised doubts about it being part of Afroasiatic at all (e.g. Theil 2006).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sands2009&quot;&gt;Sands, Bonny (2009). &quot;Africa’s Linguistic Diversity&quot;. Language and Linguistics Compass 3/2 (2009): 559–580, 10.1111/j.1749-818x.2008.00124.x&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Afroasiatic identity of [[Ongota language|Ongota]] is also broadly questioned, as is its position within Afroasiatic among those who accept it, due to the &quot;mixed&quot; appearance of the language and a paucity of research and data. [[Harold C. Fleming|Harold Fleming]] (2006) proposes that Ongota constitutes a separate branch of Afroasiatic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harrassowitz-verlag.de/pcgi/a.cgi?ausgabe=index&amp;T=1235007315045{haupt_harrassowitz=http://www.harrassowitz-verlag.de/title_3277.ahtml?T=1235007315045} Harrassowitz Verlag - The Harrassowitz Publishing House&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Bonny Sands (2009) believes the most convincing proposal is by Savà and Tosco (2003), namely that Ongota is an East Cushitic language with a [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] [[substratum]]. In other words, it would appear that the Ongota people once spoke a Nilo-Saharan language but then shifted to speaking a Cushitic language while retaining some characteristics of their earlier Nilo-Saharan language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sands2009&quot;/&gt;
* [[Beja language|Beja]] is sometimes listed as a separate branch of Afroasiatic but is more often included in the Cushitic branch, which has a high degree of internal diversity.
* Whether the various branches of Cushitic actually form a language family is sometimes questioned, but not their inclusion in Afroasiatic itself.
* There is no consensus on the interrelationships of the five non-Omotic branches of Afroasiatic (see &quot;Subgrouping&quot; below). This situation is not unusual, even among long-established language families: there are also many disagreements concerning the internal classification of the [[Indo-European languages]], for instance.
* [[Meroitic language|Meroitic]] has been proposed as an unclassified Afroasiatic language, as it shares the [[phonotactics]] characteristic of the family, but there is not enough evidence to secure a classification.

==Classification history==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Berber people]] --&gt;
In the 9th century, the Hebrew grammarian [[Judah ibn Kuraish|Judah ibn Quraysh]] of [[Tiaret]] in [[Algeria]] was the first to link two branches of Afroasiatic together; he perceived a relationship between Berber and Semitic. He knew of Semitic through his study of Arabic, Hebrew, and [[Aramaic]].

In the course of the 19th century, Europeans also began suggesting such relationships. In 1844, [[Theodor Benfey]] suggested a language family consisting of Semitic, Berber, and Cushitic (calling the latter &quot;Ethiopic&quot;). In the same year, T.N. Newman suggested a relationship between Semitic and Hausa, but this would long remain a topic of dispute and uncertainty.

[[Friedrich Müller (linguist)|Friedrich Müller]] named the traditional &quot;Hamito-Semitic&quot; family in 1876 in his ''Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft''. He defined it as consisting of a Semitic group plus a &quot;Hamitic&quot; group containing Egyptian, Berber, and Cushitic; he excluded the Chadic group. These classifications relied in part on non-linguistic anthropological and racial arguments that have largely been discredited (see [[Hamitic hypothesis]]).

Leo Reinisch (1909) proposed linking Cushitic and Chadic, while urging a more distant affinity to Egyptian and Semitic, thus foreshadowing Greenberg, but his suggestion found little resonance.

[[Marcel Cohen]] (1924) rejected the idea of a distinct Hamitic subgroup and included Hausa (a Chadic language) in his comparative Hamito-Semitic vocabulary.

[[Joseph Greenberg]] (1950) strongly confirmed Cohen's rejection of &quot;Hamitic&quot;, added (and sub-classified) the Chadic branch, and proposed the new name &quot;Afroasiatic&quot; for the family. Nearly all scholars have accepted Greenberg's classification.

In 1969, [[Harold C. Fleming|Harold Fleming]] proposed that what had previously been known as Western Cushitic is an independent branch of Afroasiatic, suggesting for it the new name [[Omotic languages|Omotic]]. This proposal and name have met with widespread acceptance.

Several scholars, including Harold Fleming and [[Robert Hetzron]], have since questioned the traditional inclusion of Beja in Cushitic.

''[[Glottolog]]'' does not accept that the inclusion or even unity of Omotic has been established, nor that of Ongota or the unclassified Kujarge, and so splits off the following groups as small families:
:[[South Omotic languages|South Omotic]], [[Mao languages|Mao]], [[Dizoid languages|Dizoid]], [[Gonga–Gimojan languages|Gonga–Gimojan]] (North Omotic apart from the preceding), [[Ongota language|Ongota]], [[Kujarge language|Kujarge]].

Little agreement exists on the [[subgrouping (linguistics)|subgrouping]] of the five or six branches of Afroasiatic: Semitic, Egyptian, Berber, Chadic, Cushitic, and Omotic. However, [[Christopher Ehret]] (1979), Harold Fleming (1981), and Joseph Greenberg (1981) all agree that the Omotic branch split from the rest first.

Otherwise:
* [[Paul Newman (linguist)|Paul Newman]] (1980) groups Berber with Chadic and Egyptian with Semitic, while questioning the inclusion of Omotic in Afroasiatic. Rolf Theil (2006) concurs with the exclusion of Omotic, but does not otherwise address the structure of the family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/hf/iln/LING2110/v07/THEIL%20Is%20Omotic%20Afroasiatic.pdf Is Omotic Afroasiatic? (In Norwegian)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Harold Fleming (1981) divides non-Omotic Afroasiatic, or &quot;Erythraean&quot;, into three groups, Cushitic, Semitic, and Chadic-Berber-Egyptian. He later added Semitic and Beja to Chadic-Berber-Egyptian and tentatively proposed [[Ongota language|Ongota]] as a new third branch of Erythraean. He thus divided Afroasiatic into two major branches, Omotic and Erythraean, with Erythraean consisting of three sub-branches, Cushitic, Chadic-Berber-Egyptian-Semitic-Beja, and Ongota.
* Like Harold Fleming, [[Christopher Ehret]] (1995: 490) divides Afroasiatic into two branches, Omotic and Erythrean. He divides Omotic into two branches, North Omotic and South Omotic. He divides Erythrean into Cushitic, comprising Beja, Agaw, and East-South Cushitic, and North Erythrean, comprising Chadic and &quot;Boreafrasian.&quot; According to his classification, Boreafrasian consists of Egyptian, Berber, and Semitic.
* [[Vladimir Orel]] and Olga Stolbova (1995) group Berber with Semitic and Chadic with Egyptian. They split up Cushitic into five or more independent branches of Afroasiatic, viewing Cushitic as a [[Sprachbund]] rather than a [[language family]].
* [[Igor M. Diakonoff]] (1996) subdivides Afroasiatic in two, grouping Berber, Cushitic, and Semitic together as East-West Afrasian (ESA), and Chadic with Egyptian as North-South Afrasian (NSA). He excludes Omotic from Afroasiatic.
* [[Lionel Bender (linguist)|Lionel Bender]] (1997) groups Berber, Cushitic, and Semitic together as &quot;Macro-Cushitic&quot;. He regards Chadic and Omotic as the branches of Afroasiatic most remote from the others.
* Alexander Militarev (2000), on the basis of [[lexicostatistics]], groups Berber with Chadic and both more distantly with Semitic, as against Cushitic and Omotic. He places Ongota in South Omotic.

==Position among the world's languages==
Afroasiatic is one of the four [[languages of Africa|language families of Africa]] identified by Joseph Greenberg in his book ''[[The Languages of Africa]]'' (1963). It is the only one that extends outside of Africa, via the Semitic branch.

There are no generally accepted relations between Afroasiatic and any other language family. However, several proposals grouping Afroasiatic with one or more other language families have been made. The best-known of these are the following:
* [[Hermann Möller]] (1906) argued for a relation between [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] and the [[Indo-European languages]]. This proposal was accepted by some linguists (e.g. [[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Holger Pedersen]] and [[Louis Hjelmslev]]) but has little currency today. (For a fuller account, see [[Indo-Semitic languages]].)
* Apparently influenced by Möller (a colleague of his at the [[University of Copenhagen]]), [[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Holger Pedersen]] included Hamito-Semitic (the term replaced by Afroasiatic) in his proposed [[Nostratic languages|Nostratic]] macro-family (cf. Pedersen 1931:336–338), which also included the Indo-European, [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric]], [[Samoyed languages|Samoyed]], [[Turkic languages|Turkish]], [[Mongolic languages|Mongolian]], [[Tungusic languages|Manchu]], and [[Yukaghir languages|Yukaghir]] languages. This inclusion was retained by subsequent Nostraticists, starting with [[Vladislav Illich-Svitych]] and [[Aharon Dolgopolsky]].
* [[Joseph Greenberg]] (2000–2002) did not reject a relationship of Afroasiatic to these other languages, but he considered it more distantly related to them than they were to each other, grouping instead these other languages in a separate macro-family, which he called [[Eurasiatic languages|Eurasiatic]], and to which he added [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages|Chukotian]], [[Nivkh language|Gilyak]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Japonic languages|Japanese-Ryukyuan]], [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo–Aleut]], and [[Ainu languages|Ainu]].
* Most recently, [[Sergei Anatolyevich Starostin|Sergei Starostin]]'s school has accepted Eurasiatic as a subgroup of Nostratic, with Afroasiatic, Dravidian, and Kartvelian in Nostratic outside of Eurasiatic. An even larger [[Borean languages|Borean]] group would contain Nostratic as well as [[Dené–Caucasian languages|Dené-Caucasian]] and [[Austric languages|Austric]].

==Date of Afroasiatic==
The earliest written evidence of an Afroasiatic language is an [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] inscription of c. 3400 BC (5,400 years ago).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/9903/newsbriefs/egypt.html Earliest Egyptian Glyphs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Symbols on [[Gerzeh culture|Gerzean]] pottery resembling [[Egyptian hieroglyphs#History and evolution|Egyptian hieroglyphs]] date back to c. 4000 BC, suggesting a still earlier possible date. This gives us a minimum date for the age of Afroasiatic. However, Ancient Egyptian is highly divergent from [[Proto-Afroasiatic language|Proto-Afroasiatic]] (Trombetti 1905: 1–2), and considerable time must have elapsed in between them. Estimates of the date at which the Proto-Afroasiatic language was spoken vary widely. They fall within a range between approximately 7500 BC (9,500 years ago) and approximately 16,000 BC (18,000 years ago). According to [[Igor M. Diakonoff]] (1988: 33n), Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken [[circa|c.]] 10,000 BC. According to Christopher Ehret (2002: 35–36), Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken c. 11,000 BC at the latest and possibly as early as c. 16,000 BC. These dates are older than dates associated with most other proto-languages.

==Afroasiatic Urheimat==
[[File:Expansion of Afroasiatic.svg|thumb|Map showing the popular hypothesis of the expansion of Afroasiatic out of Africa.]]
The term [[Afroasiatic Urheimat]] (''Urheimat'' meaning &quot;original homeland&quot; in German) refers to the 'hypothetical' place where [[Proto-Afroasiatic]] speakers lived in a single linguistic community, or complex of communities, before this original language dispersed geographically and divided into distinct languages. Afroasiatic languages are today primarily spoken in the Middle East, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, and parts of the Sahel.  Their distribution seems to have been influenced by the [[Saharan pump theory|Saharan pump]] operating over the last 10,000 years.

There is no agreement on when and where this ''Urheimat'' existed, though the language is generally believed to have originated somewhere in the area between the Eastern [[Sahara]] and the [[Horn of Africa]], including [[Egypt]], Ethiopia and [[Sudan]].&lt;ref name=blench2006&gt;Blench R (2006) Archaeology, Language, and the African Past, Rowman Altamira, ISBN 0-7591-0466-2, ISBN 978-0-7591-0466-2, http://books.google.be/books?id=esFy3Po57A8C&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ehret2004&gt;Ehret C, Keita SOY, Newman P (2004) The Origins of Afroasiatic a response to Diamond and Bellwood (2003) in the Letters of SCIENCE 306, no. 5702, p. 1680 DOI: 10.1126/science.306.5702.1680c&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bernal1987&gt;Bernal M (1987) Black Athena: the Afroasiatic roots of classical civilization, Rutgers University Press, ISBN 0-8135-3655-3, ISBN 978-0-8135-3655-2. http://books.google.be/books?id=yFLm_M_OdK4C&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bender1997&gt;Bender ML (1997), Upside Down Afrasian, Afrikanistische Arbeitspapiere 50, pp. 19-34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=militarev2005&gt;Militarev A (2005) Once more about glottochronology and comparative method: the Omotic-Afrasian case, Аспекты компаративистики - 1 (Aspects of comparative linguistics - 1).

Widespread (though not universal) features of the Afroasiatic languages include:
* A set of [[emphatic consonant]]s, variously realized as glottalized, pharyngealized, or implosive.
* [[Verb–subject–object|VSO]] [[linguistic typology|typology]] with [[subject–verb–object|SVO]] tendencies.
* A two-[[grammatical gender|gender]] system in the singular, with the feminine marked by the sound /t/.
* All Afroasiatic subfamilies show evidence of a [[causative]] affix ''s''.
* Semitic, Berber, Cushitic (including Beja), and Chadic support [[possessive suffix]]es.
* [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]] in which words inflect by changes within the root (vowel changes or [[gemination]]) as well as with prefixes and suffixes.

One of the most remarkable shared features among the Afroasiatic languages is the prefixing verb conjugation (see table above), with a distinctive pattern of prefixes beginning with /ʔ t n y/, and in particular a pattern whereby third-singular masculine /y-/ is opposed to third-singular feminine and second-singular /t-/.

[[Tonal language]]s appear in the Omotic, Chadic, and Cushitic branches of Afroasiatic, according to Ehret (1996). The Semitic, Berber, and Egyptian branches do not use tones [[phoneme|phonemically]].

==Shared vocabulary==
Following are some examples of Afroasiatic [[cognate]]s, including ten [[pronoun]]s, three [[noun]]s, and three [[verb]]s.

:''Source:'' Christopher Ehret, ''Reconstructing Proto-Afroasiatic'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1995).

:''Note:'' Ehret does not make use of Berber in his etymologies, stating (1995: 12): &quot;the kind of extensive reconstruction of proto-Berber lexicon that might help in sorting through alternative possible etymologies is not yet available.&quot; The Berber cognates here are taken from previous version of table in this article and need to be completed and referenced.

:''Abbreviations:'' NOm = 'North Omotic', SOm = 'South Omotic'.

:''Symbols:'' Following Ehret (1995: 70), a [[caron]] ˇ over a vowel indicates rising [[tone (linguistics)|tone]], a [[circumflex]] ^ over a vowel indicates falling tone.

* paras - horse (Semitic, Chadic, Cushitic) is a very old loanword and does not belong here, as the horse was introduced in the region in the late fifth- early fourth millennium BP, after the split of Afroasiatic and even Semitic.

'''Andorra''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Andorra.ogg|æ|n|ˈ|d|ɔr|ə}}; {{IPA-ca|ənˈdorə}}, {{IPA-ca|anˈdɔra|local}}), officially the '''Principality of Andorra''' ({{lang-ca|Principat d'Andorra}}), also called the '''Principality of the Valleys of Andorra'''&lt;ref&gt;Funk and Wagnalls Encyclopedia, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ca|Principat de les Valls d'Andorra}}), is a [[landlocked country|landlocked]] [[microstate]] in [[Iberian Peninsula|Southwestern Europe]], located in the eastern [[Pyrenees]] mountains and bordered by [[Spain]] and [[France]]. It is the sixth [[European microstates|smallest nation in Europe]], having an area of {{convert|468|km²|0|abbr=on}} and an estimated population of 85,000 in 2012.&lt;ref name=cia /&gt; Its capital, [[Andorra la Vella]], is the highest capital city in Europe, at an elevation of {{convert|1023|m|ft|0}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/AN/0/Andorra_la_Vella.html|title=Maps, Weather, and Airports for Andorra la Vella, Andorra |publisher=Fallingrain.com |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official language is [[Catalan language|Catalan]], although Spanish, Portuguese, and French are also commonly spoken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Background Note: Andorra|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3164.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andorra – CIA – The World Factbook|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/an.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Created under a charter in A.D. 988, the present Principality was formed in A.D. 1278. It is known as a [[principality]] as it is a [[coregency|monarchy]] headed by two [[Co-Princes of Andorra|Co-Princes]] – the Spanish/Roman Catholic  [[Bishop of Urgell]] and the [[President of France]]/[[President of the French Republic]].

Andorra is a prosperous country mainly because of [[Tourism in Andorra|its tourism industry]], which services an estimated 10.2&amp;nbsp;million visitors annually,&lt;ref name=&quot;es2&quot;&gt;[http://www.estadistica.ad/serveiestudis/web/exportar_banc_dades_csv.asp?formules=anual|inici&amp;any1=01/01/2008&amp;any2=01/01/2008&amp;codi_divisio=380&amp;lang=1&amp;codi_subtemes=59&amp;codi_tema=10 Estadistica.ad], Departament d'Estadística, Govern d'Andorra. {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because of its status as a [[tax haven]], although it is in the process of reforming its tax regime.

==History==
{{main|History of Andorra}}
[[File:Església de Sant Joan de Caselles - 10.jpg|left|thumb|Sant Joan de Caselles church, dating from the 11th century.]]
Tradition holds that Charles the Great ([[Charlemagne]]) granted a charter to the Andorran people in return for fighting against the [[Moors]]. [[Feudalism|Overlordship]] of the territory was by the [[Count of Urgell]] and eventually by the bishop of the [[Diocese of Urgell]]. In 988, [[Borrell II, Count of Barcelona|Borrell II]], Count of Urgell, gave the Andorran valleys to the Diocese of Urgell in exchange for land in [[Cerdanya]].&lt;ref name=&quot;histo1&quot;&gt;{{Cite GREC|title=La formació d'Andorra|NDCHEC=0003864|en=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the Bishop of Urgell, based in [[la Seu d'Urgell|Seu d'Urgell]], has owned Andorra.&lt;ref name=elements&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coprince-fr.ad/catala/elements.htm |title=Elements de la història del Principat d'Andorra |language=Catalan |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20100209181327/http://www.coprince-fr.ad/catala/elements.htm |archivedate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1095, Andorra did not have any type of military protection and the Bishop of Urgell, who knew that the Count of Urgell wanted to reclaim the Andorran valleys,&lt;ref name=elements/&gt; asked for help and protection from the [[Lord of Caboet]]. In 1095, the Lord of Caboet and the Bishop of Urgell signed under oath a declaration of their co-sovereignty over Andorra. Arnalda, daughter of Arnau of Caboet, married the Viscount of Castellbò and both became Viscounts of Castellbò and Cerdanya. Years later their daughter, Ermessenda,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite GREC|title=Ermessenda de Castellbò|NDCHEC=0024413|en=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; married [[Roger-Bernard II, Count of Foix|Roger Bernat II]], the French [[Count of Foix]]. They became Roger Bernat II and Ermessenda I, Counts of Foix, Viscounts of Castellbò and Cerdanya, and co-sovereigns of Andorra (shared with the Bishop of Urgell).

In the 11th century, a dispute arose between the Bishop of Urgell and the Count of Foix. The conflict was resolved in 1278 with the mediation of [[Aragon]] by the signing of the first [[Paréage of Andorra 1278|paréage]] which provided that Andorra's sovereignty be shared between the count of Foix&lt;ref name=elements/&gt; (whose title would ultimately transfer to the French head of state) and the Bishop of Urgell, in [[Catalonia]]. This gave the [[principality]] its territory and political form.

Over the years, the co-title to Andorra passed to the kings of [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]]. After Henry of Navarre became King [[Henry IV of France]], he issued an edict in 1607 that established the head of the French state and the Bishop of Urgell as co-princes of Andorra. In 1812–13, the [[First French Empire]] annexed Catalonia and divided it in four [[département]]s, with Andorra being made part of the district of [[Puigcerdà]] (département of [[Sègre]]).

Andorra declared war on [[Imperial Germany]] during World War I, but did not actually take part in the fighting. It remained in an official state of belligerency until 1939 as it was not included in the [[Treaty of Versailles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idiotsguides.com/static/didyouknow/worldhistory/07-29-11-andorra-wwi.html |title=Did you know...?

In 1933, France occupied Andorra as a result of social unrest before elections. On 12 July 1934, adventurer [[Boris Skossyreff]] issued a proclamation in Urgell, declaring himself &quot;Boris I, King of Andorra&quot;, simultaneously declaring war on the Bishop of Urgell. He was arrested by Spanish authorities on 20 July and ultimately expelled from Spain. From 1936 to 1940, a French detachment was garrisoned in Andorra to prevent influences of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and [[Francoist Spain]]. Francoist troops reached the Andorran border in the later stages of the war. During World War II, Andorra remained neutral and was an important smuggling route between [[Vichy France]] and Spain.

Given its relative isolation, Andorra has existed outside the mainstream of European history, with few ties to countries other than France, Spain and Portugal. In recent times, however, its thriving tourist industry along with developments in transport and communications have removed the country from its isolation. Its political system was modernised in 1993, when it became a member of the [[United Nations]] and the [[Council of Europe]].

Andorra is a parliamentary [[co-principality]] with the [[President of the French Republic|President of France]] and the [[Bishop of Urgell]] ([[Catalonia]], Spain), as [[List of Co-Princes of Andorra|co-princes]]. This peculiarity makes the President of France, in his capacity as [[Prince of Andorra]], an elected reigning monarch, even though he is not elected by a popular vote of the Andorran people. The politics of Andorra take place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]], whereby the [[List of heads of government of Andorra|Head of Government]] is the [[head of government|chief executive]], and of a [[wiktionary:pluriform|pluriform]] multi-party system.

The current Head of Government is [[Antoni Martí]] of the [[Democrats for Andorra]] (DA). [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both government and parliament.

The Parliament of Andorra is known as the General Council. The General Council consists of between 28 and 42 Councillors, as the members of the legislative branch are called. The Councillors serve for four-year terms and elections are held between the thirtieth and fortieth days following the dissolution of the previous Council. The Councillors can be elected on two equal constituencies.

Half are elected in equal number from each of the seven administrative parishes and the other half of the Councillors are elected from a single national constituency. 15 days after the election, the Councillors hold their inauguration. During this session, the Syndic General, who is the head of the General Council, and the Subsyndic General, his assistant, are elected. Eight days later, the Council convenes once more. During this session the Head of Government is chosen from among the Councillors.

[[File:Casa de la Vall - 18.jpg|thumb|Casa de la Vall, Andorran Parliament]]

Candidates for the nomination can be proposed by a minimum of one-fifth of the Councillors. The Council then elects the candidate with the absolute majority of votes to be Head of Government. The Syndic General then notifies the Co-princes who in turn appoint the elected candidate as the Head of Government of Andorra. The General Council is also responsible for proposing and passing laws. Bills may be presented to the Council as Private Members' Bills by three of the Local Parish Councils jointly or by at least one tenth of the citizens of Andorra.

The Council also approves the annual budget of the principality. The government must submit the proposed budget for parliamentary approval at least two months before the previous budget expires. If the budget is not approved by the first day of the next year, the previous budget is extended until a new one is approved. Once any bill is approved, the Syndic General is responsible for presenting it to the Co-princes so that they may sign and enact it.

If the Head of Government is not satisfied with the Council, he may request that the Co-princes dissolve the Council and order new elections. In turn, the Councillors have the power to remove the Head of Government from office. After a motion of censure is approved by at least one-fifth of the Councillors, the Council will vote and if it receives the absolute majority of votes, the Head of Government is removed.

==Law and criminal justice==
The judiciary is composed of the Magistrates Court, the Criminal Law Court, the High Court of Andorra, and the Constitutional Court. The High Court of Justice is composed of five judges: one appointed by the Head of Government, one each by the Co-princes, one by the Syndic General, and one by the Judges and Magistrates. It is presided over by the member appointed by the Syndic General and the judges hold office for six-year terms.

The Magistrates and Judges are appointed by the High Court, and so is the President of the Criminal Law Court. The High Court also appoints members of the Office of the Attorney General. The Constitutional Court is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and reviewing all appeals of unconstitutionality against laws and treaties. It is composed of four judges, one appointed by each of the Co-princes and two by the General Council. They serve eight-year terms. The Court is presided over by one of the Judges on a two-year rotation so that each judge at one point will be the leader of the Court.

==Foreign relations, defence, and security==
{{main|Foreign relations of Andorra}}
[[File:Bruxelles rue de la Montagne 10.jpg|thumb|The embassy of Andorra in [[Brussels]].]]
Andorra does not have its own armed forces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/an.html |title=World Factbook |author=CIA |deadurl=no |accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there is a small ceremonial Army. Responsibility for defending the nation rests primarily with France and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-1993-16868 |title=Documento BOE-A-1993-16868 |publisher=BOE.es |date=30 June 1993 |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in case of emergencies or natural disasters, the ''Sometent'' (an alarm) is called and all able-bodied men between 21 and 60 of Andorran nationality must serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://turisme.andorralavella.ad/?q=en/node/281 |title=El Sometent &amp;#124; Tourism |publisher=Turisme.andorralavella.ad |date=17 May 2011 |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;recarrega.net&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recarrega.net/arxius/Decret%20veguers%20Sometent,%20del%2023%20d%27octubre%20de%201984.pdf |title=Decret veguers Sometent, del 23 d'octubre de 1984 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is why all Andorrans, and especially the head of each house (usually the eldest able-bodied man of a house), should by law, keep a rifle, even though the law also states that the police will offer a fire-arm in case of need.&lt;ref name=&quot;recarrega.net&quot;/&gt; Andorra is a full member of the United Nations (UN), the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE), and has a special agreement with the European Union (EU).

===Military===
Andorra has a small army, which has historically been raised or reconstituted at various dates, but has never in modern times amounted to a standing army. The basic principle of Andorran defence is that all able-bodied men are available to fight if called upon by the sounding of the ''Sometent''. Being a [[landlocked country]], Andorra has no [[navy]].

In the modern era, the army has consisted of a very small body of volunteers willing to undertake ceremonial duties. Uniforms were handed down from generation to generation within families and communities. Despite not being involved in any fighting, Andorra was technically the longest combatant in the First World War, as the country was left out of the [[Versailles Peace Conference]], and technically remained at war with Germany from 1914 until 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idiotsguides.com/static/didyouknow/worldhistory/07_29_11_andorra_wwi.html |title=Did you know...? The country of Andorra fought World War 1 for 25 years |publisher=Idiotsguides.com |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The army's role in internal security was largely taken over by the formation of the [[Police Corps of Andorra]] in 1931. Brief civil disorder associated with the elections of 1933 led to assistance being sought from the French [[National Gendarmerie]],&lt;!-- Reference removed, as site quoted is currently on WP blacklist --&gt; with a detachment resident in Andorra for two months under the command of René-Jules Baulard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ben Cahoon |url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Andorra.html |title=Andorra |publisher=Worldstatesmen.org |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Andorran Army was reformed in the following year, with eleven soldiers appointed to supervisory roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/1157484 |title=Andorra's 'ARMY' – Eleven Permanent Troops! |work=The Times |date=5 January 1934 |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The force consisted of six [[Corporal]]s, one for each parish (although there are currently seven parishes, there were only six until 1978), plus four junior staff officers to co-ordinate action, and a commander with the rank of Major. It was the responsibility of the six corporals, each in his own parish, to be able to raise a fighting force from among the able-bodied men of the parish.

Today a small, twelve-man ceremonial unit remains the only permanent section of the Andorran Army, but all able-bodied men remain technically available for military service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3164.htm |title=Andorra |publisher=State.gov |date=20 April 2012 |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a requirement for each family to have access to a firearm. The army has not fought for more than 700 years, and its main responsibility is to present the [[flag of Andorra]] at official ceremonial functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aire.ad/documents/10200707_BOP14073Reglament_atm.pdf |title=Bop14073 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andorramania.com/histoire_gb.htm |title=History of the Principality of Andorra |publisher=Andorramania.com |date=11 December 1997 |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Marc Forné Molné]], Andorra's military budget is strictly from voluntary donations, and the availability of full-time voluntaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/webcast/ga/58/statements/andoeng030925.htm |title=Andorra |publisher=Un.org |date=25 September 2003 |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The myth that all members of the Andorran Army are ranked as officers is popularly maintained in many works of reference.&lt;ref&gt;An example from the United States [http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3164.htm State Department] website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An alternative [http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Europe/Andorra-POLITICS-GOVERNMENT-AND-TAXATION.html example] of the report.&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, all those serving in the permanent ceremonial reserve hold ranks as [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]], or [[non-commissioned officer]]s, because the [[Enlisted rank|other ranks]] are considered to be the rest of the able-bodied male population, who may still be called upon by the ''Sometent'' to serve, although such a call has not been made in modern times.

===GIPA===
The ''Grup d'Intervenció Policia d'Andorra'' (GIPA) is a small special forces unit trained in [[counter-terrorism]], and [[Hostage negotiator|hostage recovery]] tasks. Although it is the closest in style to an active military force, it is part of the [[Police Corps of Andorra|Police Corps]], and not the [[Military of Andorra|Army]]. As terrorist and hostage situations are a rare threat to the nation, the GIPA is commonly assigned to prisoner escort duties, and at other times to routine policing.&lt;ref&gt;Police structures [http://www.policia.ad/estructura.html detailed here].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police corps===
{{Main|Police Corps of Andorra}}
Andorra maintains a small, but modern and well-equipped internal police force with around 240 police officers, supported by civilian assistants. The principal services supplied by the Corps are uniformed community policing, criminal detection, border control, and traffic policing. There are also small specialist units including police dogs, mountain rescue, and bomb disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Carles Iglesias Carril |url=http://www.policia.ad/ |title=Andorran Police Service website |publisher=Policia.ad |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fire brigade===
The ''Andorran Fire Brigade'', with headquarters at [[Santa Coloma d'Andorra|Santa Coloma]], operates from four modern fire stations, and has a staff of around 120 firefighters. The service is equipped with 16 heavy appliances (fire tenders, turntable ladders, and specialist four-wheel drive vehicles), 4 light support vehicles (cars and vans), and 4 ambulances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bombers.ad/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=80&amp;Itemid=64 |title=Vehicle details with extensive photo gallery here |publisher=Bombers.ad |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the families of the six ancient parishes of Andorra maintained local arrangements to assist each other in fighting fires. The first fire pump purchased by the government was acquired in 1943. The serious fires (which lasted for two days) in parts of the principality in December 1959 led to calls for a permanent fire service, and the ''Andorran Fire Brigade'' was formed on 21 April 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bombers.ad/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=83&amp;Itemid=44 |title=Fire Brigade history here (in Catalan) |publisher=Bombers.ad |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fire service maintains full-time cover with five fire crews on duty at any time – two at the brigade's headquarters in Santa Coloma, and one crew at each of the other three fire stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bombers.ad |title=Andorran Fire Service site |publisher=Bombers.ad |date=17 August 2012 |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

{{main|Geography of Andorra|Geology of Andorra}}

===Parishes===
{{main|Parishes of Andorra}}
Andorra consists of seven parishes:
* [[Andorra la Vella]]
* [[Canillo]]
* [[Encamp]]
* [[Escaldes-Engordany]]
* [[La Massana]]
* [[Ordino]]
* [[Sant Julià de Lòria]]

===Physical geography===
[[File:Grandvalira ski resort, Andorra5.jpg|thumb|right|Scenery of Andorran mountains]]
[[File:Andorra topographic map-en.svg|thumb|Topographic map of Andorra]]

Due to its location in the eastern [[Pyrenees]] mountain range, Andorra consists predominantly of rugged mountains, the highest being the [[Coma Pedrosa]] at {{convert|2942|m|ft|0}}, and the average elevation of Andorra is {{convert|1996|m|ft|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;Atlas of Andorra (1991), Andorran Government. ISBN 99913-9-063-4. {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are dissected by three narrow valleys in a Y shape that combine into one as the main stream, the [[Gran Valira]] river, leaves the country for Spain (at Andorra's lowest point of {{convert|840|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}). Andorra's land area is {{convert|468|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|0}}.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Andorra belongs to the Atlantic European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Andorra belongs to the [[ecoregion]] of Pyrenees conifer and mixed forests.

===Climate===
Andorra has an [[alpine climate]] and [[continental climate]]. Its higher elevation means there is, on average, more snow in winter, lower humidity, and it is slightly cooler in summer. There are, on average, 300&amp;nbsp;days per year of sunshine.

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Andorra}}
[[File:Caldea.jpg|thumb|right|Caldea spa in [[Escaldes-Engordany]], heated by natural [[hot spring]] water which is plentiful in the parish.]]
[[File:Tree map export 2009 Andorra.jpeg|thumb|Exports in 2009]]
Tourism, the mainstay of Andorra's tiny, well-to-do economy, accounts for roughly 80% of GDP. An estimated 10.2&amp;nbsp;million tourists visit annually,&lt;ref name=&quot;es2&quot;/&gt; attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and by its summer and winter resorts. Andorra's relative advantage has recently eroded as the economies of adjoining France and Spain have been opened up, providing broader availability of goods and lower [[tariff]]s.

The banking sector, with its [[tax haven]] status, also contributes substantially to the economy. Agricultural production is limited—only 2% of the land is arable—and most food has to be imported. Some tobacco is grown locally. The principal livestock activity is domestic sheep raising. Manufacturing output consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture. Andorra's natural resources include hydroelectric power, mineral water, timber, iron ore, and lead.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/an.html |title=CIA World Factbook entry: Andorra |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andorra is not a member of the European Union, but enjoys a [[Andorra – European Union relations|special relationship]] with it, such as being treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs) and as a non-EU member for agricultural products. Andorra lacked a currency of its own and used both the [[French franc]] and the [[Spanish peseta]] in banking transactions until 31 December 1999, when both currencies were replaced by the EU's single currency, the euro. Coins and notes of both the franc and the peseta remained legal tender in Andorra until 31 December 2002. Andorra is negotiating to issue its own euro coins.

Andorra has traditionally had one of the world's lowest unemployment rates. In 2009, it stood at 2.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2129rank.html |title=CIA World Factbook: Andorra |deadurl=no |accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andorra has long benefited from its status as a tax haven, with revenues raised exclusively through import tariffs. However, during the [[European sovereign-debt crisis]] of the 21st century, its tourist economy suffered a decline, partly caused by a drop in the prices of goods in Spain, which undercut Andorran duty-free shopping. This led to a growth in unemployment. On 1 January 2012, a business tax of 10% was introduced,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andorra gets a taste of taxation|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/dec/27/andorra-financial-crisis-tax|work=The guardian|accessdate=30 March 2013|date=27 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a [[sales tax]] of 2% a year later, which raised just over 14 million euros in its first quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Andorra Unveils First Indirect Tax Revenue Figures|url=http://www.tax-news.com/news/Andorra_Unveils_First_Indirect_Tax_Revenue_Figures____60703.html|newspaper=Tax News|date=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 May 2013, it was announced that Andorra intended to legislate for the introduction of [[income tax]] by the end of June, against a background of increasing dissatisfaction with the existence of tax havens among EU members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Andorra to introduce income tax for first time|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22745895|newspaper=BBC News|date=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement was made following a meeting in Paris between the Head of Government [[Antoni Marti]] and the French President and Prince of Andorra, [[François Hollande]]. Hollande welcomed the move as part of a process of Andorra &quot;bringing its taxation in line with international standards&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.notretemps.com/argent/andorre-aligne-progressivement-sa,i29431|title=Andorre aligne progressivement sa fiscalité sur les standards internationaux (Elysée)|newspaper=Notre Temps|date=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Demographics of Andorra}}

===Population===
The population of Andorra is estimated to be 85,082 (July 2011).&lt;ref name=cia /&gt; The population has grown from 5,000 in 1900.

Andorran nationals form a plurality, but not a majority, in the country (31,363 / 33%);&lt;ref name=&quot;de1&quot;&gt;Departament d'Estadistica, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; other nationalities include Spaniards (27,300 / 23%),&lt;ref name=&quot;de1&quot;/&gt; Portuguese (13,794 / 21%),&lt;ref name=&quot;de1&quot;/&gt; French (5,213 / 17%),&lt;ref name=&quot;de1&quot;/&gt; Britons (1,085)&lt;ref name=&quot;de1&quot;/&gt; and Italians.

Two-thirds of the population is made up of citizens without Andorran nationality, who do not have the right to vote (suffrage) in communal elections. Moreover, they are not allowed to be elected as president or to own more than 33% of the capital stock of a privately held company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/ANDORRA/Parlamento/andorrano/facilita/hijos/residentes/adquisicion/nacionalidad/elpepiint/19850801elpepiint_23/Tes/ El País 01/08/1985], [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/ANDORRA/examen/ser/andorrano/elpepiint/19851027elpepiint_18/Tes/ El País 27/10/1985], [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/RIBAS/_oSCAR/MARTi_ALANiS/_JOAN_/ARZOBISPO_DE_URGELL/ANDORRA/Constitucion/Andorra/seguira/limitando/derechos/poblacion/elpepiint/19920509elpepiint_5/Tes/ El País 09/05/1992], [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/sociedad/Andorra/solo/inmigrantes/sanos/elpporint/20060714elpepisoc_8/Tes/ El País 14/07/2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages===
{{main|Languages of Andorra}}
The historic and [[official language]] is [[Catalan language|Catalan]], a [[Romance language]]. The Andorran government is keen to encourage the use of Catalan. It funds a Commission for Catalan [[Toponymy]] in Andorra (Catalan: ''la Comissió de Toponímia d'Andorra''), and provides free Catalan classes to assist immigrants. Andorran television and radio stations use Catalan.

Because of immigration, historical links, and close geographic proximity, Spanish, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and French are also commonly spoken. Most Andorran residents can speak one or more of these, in addition to Catalan. English is less commonly spoken among the general population, though it is understood to varying degrees in the major tourist resorts. Andorra is one of only four European countries (together with France, Monaco, and Turkey)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/minorities/default_en.asp |title=Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (FCNM) : National Minorities, '&amp;#39;Council of Europe'&amp;#39;, 14 September 2010 |publisher=Coe.int |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that have never signed the [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities|Council of Europe Framework Convention on National Minorities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=157&amp;CM=&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG|title=Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities CETS No. 157 |publisher=Conventions.coe.int |accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
The population of Andorra is predominantly (90%) Roman Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/an.html|title=CIA&amp;nbsp;– The World Fact Book&amp;nbsp;– Andorra}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their patron saint is [[Our Lady of Meritxell]]. Though it is not an official state religion, the constitution acknowledges a special relationship with the Catholic Church, offering some special privileges to that group. Other Christian denominations include the [[Anglican Church]], the [[Reunification Church]], the [[New Apostolic Church]], and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].

==Education==

===Schools===
Children between the ages of 6 and 16 are required by law to have full-time education. Education up to secondary level is provided free of charge by the government.

There are three systems of schools&amp;nbsp;– Andorran, French and Spanish&amp;nbsp;– which use Catalan, French and Spanish, respectively, as the main language of instruction. Parents may choose which system their children attend. All schools are built and maintained by Andorran authorities, but teachers in the French and Spanish schools are paid for the most part by France and Spain. About 50% of Andorran children attend the French primary schools, and the rest attend Spanish or Andorran schools.

===University of Andorra===
The [[Universitat d'Andorra]] (UdA) is the state public university and is the only university in Andorra. It was established in 1997. The University provides first-level degrees in nursing, computer science, business administration, and educational sciences, in addition to higher professional education courses. The only two graduate schools in Andorra are the Nursing School and the School of Computer Science, the latter having a PhD programme.

====Virtual Studies Centre====
The geographical complexity of the country as well as the small number of students prevents the University of Andorra from developing a full academic program, and it serves principally as a centre for virtual studies, connected to Spanish and French universities. The Virtual Studies Centre (''Centre d’Estudis Virtuals'') at the University runs in the region of twenty degrees at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels in fields including tourism, law, Catalan philology, humanities, psychology, political sciences, audiovisual communication, telecommunications engineering, and East Asia studies. The Centre also runs various postgraduate programs and continuing-education courses for professionals.

==Healthcare==
Healthcare in Andorra is provided to all employed persons and their families by the government-run social security system, [[Caixa Andorrana de Seguretat Social|CASS]] (Caixa Andorrana de Seguretat Social), which is funded by employer and employee contributions in respect of salaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;travenand&quot;&gt;''Travailler en Andorre'' (May 2006), Govern d'Andorra, Servei d'Ocupació, p.30. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of healthcare is covered by CASS at rates of 75% for out-patient expenses such as medicines and hospital visits, 90% for hospitalisation, and 100% for work-related accidents. The remainder of the costs may be covered by private health insurance. Other residents and tourists require full private health insurance.&lt;ref name=&quot;travenand&quot;/&gt;

The main hospital, Meritxell, is in [[Escaldes-Engordany]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cassps&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://online.cass.ad/web/lacass/professionalSalut/hospitals/Andorra |title=List of specialties with coverage by CASS at Hospital Nostra Senyora de Meritxell (2009) |publisher=Online.cass.ad |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also 12 primary health care centres in various locations around the Principality.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassps&quot;/&gt;

==Transport==

Andorra has no railways, although the line connecting Latour-de-Carol and [[Toulouse]], which in turn connects to France's [[TGV]]s at Toulouse, runs within two kilometres of the Andorran border.]]

Until the 20th century, Andorra had very limited transport links to the outside world, and development of the country was affected by its physical isolation. Even now, the nearest major airports at Toulouse and Barcelona are both three hours' drive from Andorra.

Andorra has a road network of {{convert|279|km|0|abbr=on}}, of which {{convert|76|km|0|abbr=on}} is unpaved. The two main roads out of [[Andorra la Vella]] are the CG-1 to the Spanish border, and the CG-2 to the French border via the Envalira Tunnel near [[El Pas de la Casa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mobi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobilitat.ad/CA/default.asp|title=Agència de Mobilitat, Govern d'Andorra |publisher=Mobilitat.ad |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}{{dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bus services cover all metropolitan areas and many rural communities, with services on most major routes running half-hourly or more frequently during peak travel times. There are frequent long-distance bus services from Andorra to [[Barcelona]] and [[Toulouse]]. Bus services are mostly run by private companies, but some local ones are operated by the government.

There are no railways, ports, or airports for fixed-wing aircraft in Andorra. There are, however, heliports in [[La Massana]], [[Arinsal]] and [[Escaldes-Engordany]] with commercial helicopter services.&lt;ref name=&quot;heliand&quot;&gt;Heliand&amp;nbsp;– Serveis (2009).

[http://www.helitrans.ad/ Helitrans.ad] {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearby airports are located in Barcelona, Toulouse, Perpignan, Reus, and Girona. The closest public airport is [[Perpignan - Rivesaltes Airport]], which is {{convert|160|km|0|abbr=on}} away and has short-haul services to several destinations in the United Kingdom and France. [[La Seu d'Urgell Airport]], a small airfield {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} north of Spain, near to Andorra, currently used only by private aeroplanes, is being studied as a possible future airport for public aviation services.&lt;ref name=&quot;gdc2008&quot;&gt;La Generalitat es reuneix amb els pobles afectats per l'aeroport (31 October 2008).

The nearest railway station is [[L'Hospitalet-près-l'Andorre]] {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} east of Andorra which is on the {{RailGauge|1435mm}}[[Standard gauge|-gauge]] line from [[Latour-de-Carol]], ({{convert|25|km|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) southeast of Andorra, to [[Toulouse]] and on to Paris by the French [[TGV|high-speed trains]]. This line is operated by the [[SNCF]]. Latour-de-Carol has a scenic [[metre gauge]] [[Yellow Train|trainline]] to [[Villefranche-de-Conflent]], as well as the SNCF's {{RailGauge|1435mm}}-gauge line connecting to [[Perpignan]], and the [[RENFE|RENFE's]] {{RailGauge|1668mm}} [[Iberian gauge|-gauge]] line to [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bueker.net/trainspotting/map.php?file=maps/french-network/french-network.gif|title=Sncf Map |language={{de icon}} |publisher=Bueker.net |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maplandia.com/france/languedoc-roussillon/pyrenees-orientales/prades/latour-de-carol/ |title=Google map |publisher=Maplandia.com |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media and telecommunications==
{{update|section|date=February 2011}}
{{Main|Telecommunications in Andorra}}
In Andorra, mobile and fixed telephone and internet services are operated exclusively by the Andorran national telecommunications company, SOM, also known as ''Servei de Telecomunicacions d'Andorra'' (STA). The same company also manages the technical infrastructure for national broadcasting of digital television and radio.

By the end of 2010, it is planned that every home in the country will have fibre-to-the-home for internet access at a minimum speed of 100&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s.&lt;ref name=&quot;somfo&quot;&gt;SOM Newsletter, March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is only one Andorran television station, ''[[Ràdio i Televisió d'Andorra]]'' (RTVA). ''Radio Nacional d’Andorra'' operates two radio stations, ''[[Radio Andorra]]'' and ''Andorra Música''. There are three national newspapers, ''[[Diari d'Andorra]]'', ''[[El Periòdic d'Andorra]]'', and ''[[Bondia (newspaper)|Bondia]]'' as well as several local newspapers.

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of Andorra}}
{{see also|Music of Andorra}}
[[File:HPIM0309.JPG|thumb|right|Andorran flag on balcony, Ordino]]
The official and historic language is Catalan. Thus the culture is Catalan, with its own specificity.

Andorra is home to folk dances like the contrapàs ([[ca]]) and marratxa, which survive in [[Sant Julià de Lòria]] especially. Andorran folk music has similarities to the music of its neighbours, but is especially [[music of Catalonia|Catalan]] in character, especially in the presence of dances such as the [[sardana]]. Other Andorran folk dances include contrapàs in [[Andorra la Vella]] and Saint Anne's dance in Escaldes-Engordany. Andorra's national holiday is [[Our Lady of Meritxell]] Day, 8 September.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;/&gt; American Folk Artist [[Malvina Reynolds]], intrigued by its defence budget of $4.90, wrote a song &quot;Andorra&quot;. Pete Seeger added verses, and sang &quot;Andorra&quot; on his 1962 album &quot;The Bitter and the Sweet.&quot;.

==Sports==
Andorra is famous for the practice of [[Winter Sports]] and [[Roller hockey (quad)|Roller Hockey]]. Andorra usually plays in [[CERH European Roller Hockey Championship|CERH Euro Cup]] and in [[FIRS Roller Hockey World Cup]].
In 2011, Andorra was the host country to the [[2011 European League Final Eight]].
The country is represented in association football by the [[Andorra national football team]]. However, the team has had little success internationally because of Andorra's small population.&lt;ref name=&quot;fifa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/associations/association=and/ranking/gender=m/index.html |title=FIFA Rankings – Andorra |publisher=Fifa.com |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2012, Andorra raised its first national cricket team and played a home match against the Dutch Fellowship of Fairly Odd Places Cricket Club. The first match played in the history of Andorra at an altitude of {{convert|1300|m|sp=us}}. FFOP CC ended 187 for 5 wickets, while Andorra XI were all out at 105. Andorra XI has stated they want to keep on playing the game, both at home and away. Cricket clubs in southern France may be challenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Netherlands Based FFOP CC Beats Andorra National Team|url=http://www.cricketworld.com/netherlands-based-ffop-cc-beats-andorra-xi/32216.htm|work=Cricket World|accessdate=18 December 2012|date=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}
In [[mathematics]] and [[statistics]], the '''arithmetic mean''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|ˌ|æ|r|ɪ|θ|ˈ|m|ɛ|t|ɪ|k|_|ˈ|m|iː|n}}), or simply the [[mean]] or '''average''' when the context is clear, is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the number of numbers in the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jacobs | first = Harold R. | title = Mathematics: A Human Endeavor | edition = Third | year = 1994 | publisher = [[W. H. Freeman]] | page = 547 | isbn = 0-7167-2426-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection is often a set of results of an [[experiment (probability theory)|experiment]], or a set of results from a [[Survey methodology|survey]]. The term &quot;arithmetic mean&quot; is preferred in some contexts in mathematics and statistics because it helps distinguish it from other [[average|mean]]s, such as the [[geometric mean]] and the [[harmonic mean]].

In addition to mathematics and statistics, the arithmetic mean is used frequently in fields such as economics, [[sociology]], and history, and it is used in almost every academic field to some extent. For example, per capita income is the arithmetic average income of a nation's population.

While the arithmetic mean is often used to report [[central tendency|central tendencies]], it is not a [[robust statistic]], meaning that it is greatly influenced by [[outlier]]s (values that are very much larger or smaller than most of the values). Notably, for [[skewed distribution]]s, such as the [[distribution of income]] for which a few people's incomes are substantially greater than most people's, the arithmetic mean may not accord with one's notion of &quot;middle&quot;, and robust statistics, such as the [[median]], may be a better description of central tendency.

In a more obscure usage, any sequence of values that form an [[Arithmetic progression|arithmetic sequence]] between two numbers ''x'' and ''y'' can be called &quot;arithmetic means between ''x'' and ''y''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Foerster | first = Paul A. | title = Algebra and Trigonometry: Functions and Applications, Teacher's Edition | edition = Classics | year = 2006 | publisher = [[Prentice Hall]] | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ | page = 573 | url = http://www.amazon.com/Algebra-Trigonometry-Functions-Applications-Prentice/dp/0131657100 | isbn = 0-13-165711-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Suppose we have a data set containing the values &lt;math&gt;a_1,\ldots,a_n.&lt;/math&gt; The arithmetic mean &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is defined by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;A=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i&lt;/math&gt;.

If the data set is a [[statistical population]] (i.e., consists of every possible observation and not just a subset of them), then the mean of that population is called the '''population mean'''. If the data set is a [[sampling (statistics)|statistical sample]] (a subset of the population), we call the statistic resulting from this calculation a '''sample mean'''.

The arithmetic mean of a variable is often denoted by a bar, for example as in &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt; (read &quot;x bar&quot;), which is the mean of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; values &lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;JM&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Medhi| first = Jyotiprasad| title = Statistical Methods: An Introductory Text| url = http://books.google.com/?id=bRUwgf_q5RsC| year = 1992| publisher = New Age International| isbn = 9788122404197| pages = 53–58 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivating properties==

The arithmetic mean has several properties that make it useful, especially as a measure of central tendency. These include:

* If numbers &lt;math&gt;x_1,\dotsc,x_n&lt;/math&gt; have mean &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;(x_1-\bar{x}) + \dotsb + (x_n-\bar{x}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;x_i-\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from a given number to the mean, one way to interpret this property is as saying that the numbers to the left of the mean are balanced by the numbers to the right of the mean. The mean is the only single number for which the [[errors and residuals in statistics|residuals]] (deviations from the estimate) sum to zero.
* If it is required to use a single number as a &quot;typical&quot; value for a set of known numbers &lt;math&gt;x_1,\dotsc,x_n&lt;/math&gt;, then the arithmetic mean of the numbers does this best, in the sense of minimizing the sum of squared deviations from the typical value: the sum of &lt;math&gt;(x_i-\bar{x})^2&lt;/math&gt;. (It follows that the sample mean is also the best single predictor in the sense of having the lowest [[root mean squared error]].)&lt;ref name=&quot;JM&quot;/&gt; If the arithmetic mean of a population of numbers is desired, then the estimate of it that is [[unbiased estimate|unbiased]] is the arithmetic mean of a sample drawn from the population.

==Contrast with median==

The arithmetic mean may be contrasted with the median. The median is defined such that half the values are larger than, and half are smaller than, the median. If elements in the sample data [[arithmetic progression|increase arithmetically]], when placed in some order, then the median and arithmetic average are equal. For example, consider the data sample &lt;math&gt;{1,2,3,4}&lt;/math&gt;. The average is &lt;math&gt;2.5&lt;/math&gt;, as is the median. However, when we consider a sample that cannot be arranged so as to increase arithmetically, such as &lt;math&gt;{1,2,4,8,16}&lt;/math&gt;, the median and arithmetic average can differ significantly. In this case, the arithmetic average is 6.2 and the median is 4. In general, the average value can vary significantly from most values in the sample, and can be larger or smaller than most of them.

There are applications of this phenomenon in many fields. For example, since the 1980s, the median income in the United States has increased more slowly than the arithmetic average of income.

==Generalizations==

===Weighted average===

A [[weighted average]], or weighted mean, is an average in which some data points count more strongly than others, in that they are given more weight in the calculation. For example, the arithmetic mean of &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\frac{(3+5)}{2} = 4&lt;/math&gt;, or equivalently &lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{1}{2} \cdot 3\right) + \left( \frac{1}{2} \cdot 5\right) = 4&lt;/math&gt;. In contrast, a ''weighted'' mean in which the first number receives twice as much weight as the second (perhaps because it is assumed to appear twice as often in the general population from which these numbers were sampled) would be calculated as &lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{2}{3} \cdot 3\right) + \left(\frac{1}{3} \cdot 5\right) = \frac{11}{3}&lt;/math&gt;. Here the weights, which necessarily sum to the value one, are &lt;math&gt;(2/3)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(1/3)&lt;/math&gt;, the former being twice the latter. Note that the arithmetic mean (sometimes called the &quot;unweighted average&quot; or &quot;equally weighted average&quot;) can be interpreted as a special case of a weighted average in which all the weights are equal to each other (equal to &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; in the above example, and equal to &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt; in a situation with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; numbers being averaged).

===Continuous probability distributions===

[[File:Comparison mean median mode.svg|thumb|300px|Comparison of mean, [[median]] and [[mode (statistics)|mode]] of two [[log-normal distribution]]s with different [[skewness]].]]

When a population of numbers, and any sample of data from it, could take on any of a continuous range of numbers, instead of for example just integers, then the [[probability]] of a number falling into one range of possible values could differ from the probability of falling into a different range of possible values, even if the lengths of both ranges are the same. In such a case, the set of probabilities can be described using a [[continuous probability distribution]]. The analog of a weighted average in this context, in which there are an infinitude of possibilities for the precise value of the variable, is called the ''mean of the probability distribution''. The most widely encountered probability distribution is called the [[normal distribution]]; it has the property that all measures of its central tendency, including not just the mean but also the aforementioned median and the [[Mode (statistics)|mode]], are equal to each other. This property does not hold however, in the cases of a great many probability distributions, such as the [[lognormal distribution]] illustrated here.

==Angles==
{{Main|Mean of circular quantities}}

Particular care must be taken when using cyclic data, such as phases or [[angle]]s. Naïvely taking the arithmetic mean of 1° and 359° yields a result of 180°.
This is incorrect for two reasons:
* Firstly, angle measurements are only defined up to an additive constant of [[degree (angle)|360°]] (or 2π, if measuring in [[radian]]s). Thus one could as easily call these 1° and −1°, or 361° and 719°, each of which gives a different average.
* Secondly, in this situation, 0° (equivalently, 360°) is geometrically a better ''average'' value: there is lower [[statistical dispersion|dispersion]] about it (the points are both 1° from it, and 179° from 180°, the putative average).

In general application, such an oversight will lead to the average value artificially moving towards the middle of the numerical range. A solution to this problem is to use the optimization formulation ([[viz.]], define the mean as the central point: the point about which one has the lowest dispersion), and redefine the difference as a modular distance (i.e., the distance on the circle: so the modular distance between 1° and 359° is 2°, not 358°).

The '''American Football Conference''' ('''AFC''') is one of the two [[Conference (sports)|conferences]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL). This conference and its counterpart, the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC), currently contain 16 teams each, making up the 32 teams of the NFL.

==Current teams==
Since 2002, the AFC has 16 teams, organized into four [[Division (sport)|divisions]] each with four teams: [[AFC East|East]], [[AFC North|North]], [[AFC South|South]] and [[AFC West|West]].

==Season structure==
{{main|National Football League#Season structure}}

[[Image:NFL Schedule Sample.PNG|thumb|right|386px|A sample scheduling grid, with a single team's (the Browns) schedule highlighted. Under this hypothetical schedule, the Browns would play the teams in blue twice and the teams in yellow once, for a total of 16 games.]]

Each AFC team plays the other teams in its division twice (home and away) during the regular season, in addition to 10 other games assigned to their schedule by the NFL the previous May. Two of these games are assigned on the basis of the team's final division standing in the previous season. The remaining 8 games are split between the roster of two other NFL divisions. This assignment shifts each year. For instance, in the [[2007 NFL season|2007 regular season]], each team in the [[AFC West]] played one game against each team in both the [[AFC South]] and the [[NFC North]]. In this way division competition consists of common opponents, with the exception of the 2 games assigned on the strength of each team's prior division standing. (i.e. the division winner will face the other two division winners in the AFC divisions that they are not scheduled to play) The NFC operates according to the same system.

At the end of each football [[season (sport)|season]], there are [[NFL playoffs|playoff]] games involving the top six teams in the AFC (the four division champions by place standing and the top two remaining non-division-champion teams (&quot;[[Wild card (sports)|wild cards]]&quot;) by record). The last two teams remaining play in the [[AFC Championship Game|AFC Championship game]] with the winner receiving the [[Lamar Hunt]] Trophy. The AFC champion plays the NFC champion in the [[Super Bowl]]. After [[Super Bowl XLVII]] the AFC has won 20 Super Bowls to the 24 won by the NFC. Since losing 13 consecutive Super Bowls in the 1980s and 1990s ([[Super Bowl XIX|XIX]]&amp;ndash;[[Super Bowl XXXI|XXXI]]), the AFC has won 10 of the last 16. The coach of the team with the best record that lost in the AFC Divisional round is the coach of the [[Pro Bowl]].

==History==
[[File:Oldafclogo.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Original American Football Conference logo, based on the AFL logo with blue stars]]
Both the AFC and the NFC were created after the NFL [[AFL-NFL Merger|merged]] with the [[American Football League]] (AFL) in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldalmanacforkids.com/WAKI-ViewArticle.aspx?pin=x-fo055624a&amp;article_id=608&amp;chapter_id=13&amp;chapter_title=Sports&amp;article_title=Pro_Football_History|title=Pro Football - HISTORY|accessdate=3 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AFL began play in 1960 with eight teams, and added two more expansion clubs (the [[Miami Dolphins]] in 1966 and the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] in 1968) before the merger. In order to equalize the number of teams in each conference, three NFL teams that predated the AFL's launch (the [[Cleveland Browns]], [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], and the then-[[Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]]) joined the ten former AFL teams to form the AFC. The two AFL divisions [[AFL East]] and [[AFL West]] were more or less intact, while the Century Division, in which the Browns and the Steelers had played since 1967, was moved from the NFL to become the new AFC Central.

Since the merger, five expansion teams have joined the AFC and two have left, thus making the current total 16. When the [[Seattle Seahawks]] and the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] joined the league in 1976, they were temporarily placed in the NFC and AFC respectively. This arrangement lasted for one season only before the two teams switched conferences. The Seahawks eventually returned to the NFC as a result of the [[2002 NFL season#Expansion and realignment|2002 realignment]]. The expansion [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] joined the AFC in 1995.

Due to the [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|relocation controversy]] of the Cleveland Browns, a new AFC franchise called the [[Baltimore Ravens]] was officially established in 1996 while the Browns were reactivated in 1999.

The [[Houston Texans]] were then added to the league in 2002, joining the AFC.

Between 2000 and 2012, the AFC had sent either the [[Baltimore Ravens]] (2 times), the [[Indianapolis Colts]] (2 times), the [[New England Patriots]] (5 times), the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] (3 times), or the [[Oakland Raiders]] (1 time) to the [[Super Bowl]]. By contrast, the [[National Football Conference|NFC]] has sent 11 different teams during that same time frame.

==Logo==
[[Image:American Football Conference logo old.svg|right|thumb|2nd American Football Conference logo From 1970s to 2009|216x216px]]
The merged league created a new logo for the AFC that took elements of the old AFL logo, specifically the &quot;A&quot; and the six stars surrounding it. The AFC logo basically remained unchanged from 1970 to 2009. The 2010 NFL season introduced an updated AFC logo, with the most notable revision being the removal of two stars (leaving four representing the four divisions of the AFC), and moving the stars inside the letter, similar to the NFC logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniwatchblog.com/2010/03/02/but-i-absolutely-refuse-to-write-about-the-draft-caps/|title=But I Absolutely Refuse to Write About the Draft Caps |author=Paul Lukas |publisher=Uni Watch blog |accessdate=16 April 2010| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20100506134900/http://www.uniwatchblog.com/2010/03/02/but-i-absolutely-refuse-to-write-about-the-draft-caps/| archivedate= 6 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Animal Farm''''' is an [[allegory|allegorical]] and [[dystopian novel]] by [[George Orwell]], published in [[England]] on 17 August 1945. According to Orwell, the book reflects events leading up to the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and then on into the Stalin era in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningzone/clips/george-orwells-animal-farm-historical-context-pt-1-3/8177.html BBC Learning Zone, ''Animal Farm'']&lt;/ref&gt; Orwell, a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]],&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, George. &quot;[[Why I Write]]&quot; (1936) (''The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell Volume 1 – An Age Like This 1945–1950'' p. 23 (Penguin))&lt;/ref&gt; was an outspoken critic of [[Joseph Stalin]] and, especially after experiences with the [[NKVD]] and the [[Spanish Civil War]], he was actively opposed to the controversial ideology of [[Stalinism]].&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, writing in his review of [[Franz Borkenau]]'s ''The Spanish Cockpit'' in ''[[Time and Tide (magazine)|Time and Tide]]'', 31 July 1937, and &quot;Spilling the Spanish Beans&quot;, ''New English Weekly'', 29 July 1937&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Soviet Union]], he believed, had become a brutal [[dictatorship]], built upon a [[cult of personality]] and enforced by [[Moscow Show Trials|a reign of terror]]. In a letter to Yvonne Davet, Orwell described ''Animal Farm'' as a [[satire|satirical]] tale against Stalin &quot;''un conte satirique contre Staline''&quot;,{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}} and in his essay &quot;[[Why I Write]]&quot; (1946), he wrote that ''Animal Farm'' was the first book in which he had tried, with full consciousness of what he was doing, &quot;to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole&quot;.

The original title was ''Animal Farm: A Fairy Story'', though the subtitle was dropped by U.S. publishers for its 1946 publication and subsequently all but one of the translations during Orwell's lifetime omitted it. Other variations in the title include: ''A Satire'' and ''A Contemporary Satire''.{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}} Orwell suggested the title ''Union des républiques socialistes animales'' for the French translation, which recalled the French name of the [[Soviet Union]], ''Union des républiques socialistes soviétiques'', and which abbreviates to URSA, the [[Latin]] for &quot;bear&quot;, a [[Russian bear|symbol of Russia]].{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}}

Orwell wrote the book from November 1943 – February 1944, when the wartime alliance with the Soviet Union was at its height and Stalin was regarded highly by the British people and intelligentsia, a circumstance that Orwell hated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bradbury, Malcolm]], Introduction, p. vi, ''Animal Farm'', Penguin edition, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially rejected by a number of British and American publishers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historytoday.com/robert-pearce/animal-farm-sixty-years History Today Vol.55, Issue 8, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; including one of Orwell's own, [[Victor Gollancz]]. Its publication was thus delayed, though it became a great commercial success when it did finally appear partly because the [[Cold War]] so quickly followed [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Dickstein, Morris. ''Cambridge Companion to Orwell'', p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

''Time'' magazine chose the book as one of the 100 best English-language novels (1923 to 2005);{{sfn|Grossman|Lacayo|2005|p=}} it also featured at number 31 on the [[Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels]]. It won a Retrospective [[Hugo Award]] in 1996, and is also included in the [[Great Books of the Western World]] selection.

==Plot summary==

[[Old Major]], the old boar on the Manor Farm, summons the animals on the farm together for a meeting, during which he refers to humans as [[parasite]]s and teaches the animals a revolutionary song called ''[[Beasts of England]]''. When Major dies, two young pigs, [[Snowball (Animal Farm)|Snowball]] and [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]], assume command and consider it a duty to prepare for the Rebellion. The animals revolt and drive the drunken and irresponsible farmer [[Jones (Animal Farm)|Mr. Jones]] from the farm, renaming it &quot;Animal Farm&quot;. They adopt Seven Commandments of Animalism, the most important of which is, &quot;All animals are equal.&quot;

Snowball teaches the animals to read and write, while Napoleon educates young puppies on the principles of [[Animal Farm#Animalism|Animalism]]. Food is plentiful, and the farm runs smoothly. The pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items, ostensibly for their personal health. Napoleon and Snowball struggle for preeminence. When Snowball announces his plans to build a [[windmill]], Napoleon has his dogs chase Snowball away and subsequently declares himself leader of Animal Farm.

Napoleon enacts changes to the governance structure of the farm, replacing meetings with a committee of pigs who will run the farm. Through a young pig named [[Squealer (Animal Farm)|Squealer]], Napoleon claims credit for the windmill idea. The animals work harder with the promise of easier lives with the windmill. When the animals find the windmill collapsed after a violent storm, Napoleon and Squealer convince the animals that Snowball is trying to sabotage their project. Once Snowball becomes a [[scapegoat]], Napoleon begins to [[Reign of Terror|purge]] the farm with his dogs, killing animals he accuses of consorting with his old rival. ''Beasts of England'' is replaced by an anthem glorifying Napoleon, who appears to be adopting the lifestyle of a man. The animals remain convinced that they are better off than they were under Mr Jones.

[[Frederick (Animal Farm)|Mr Frederick]], one of the neighbouring farmers, attacks the farm, using [[Explosive material|blasting powder]] to blow up the restored windmill. Though the animals win the battle, they do so [[Pyrrhic victory|at great cost]], as many, including [[Boxer (Animal Farm)|Boxer]] the workhorse, are wounded. Despite his injuries, Boxer continues working harder and harder, until he collapses while working on the windmill. Napoleon sends for a van to take Boxer to the veterinary surgeon, explaining that better care can be given there. Benjamin, the cynical donkey who &quot;could read as well as any pig&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, George (1946). ''Animal Farm''. London: Penguin Group. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; notices that the van belongs to a [[knacker]], and attempts a futile rescue. Squealer reports that the van was purchased by the hospital and the writing from the previous owner had not been repainted. But in reality, Napoleon has sold his most loyal and long-suffering worker for money to buy himself [[whisky]].

{{anchor|moreEqual}}
Years pass, and the pigs start to resemble humans, as they walk upright, carry whips, and wear clothes. The Seven Commandments are abridged to a single phrase: &quot;All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others&quot;. Napoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs and local farmers, with whom he celebrates a new alliance. He abolishes the practice of the revolutionary traditions and restores the name &quot;The Manor Farm&quot;. As the animals look from pigs to humans, they realise they can no longer distinguish between the two.

==Characters==

===Pigs===

*[[Old Major]] – An aged prize [[Middle White|Middle White boar]] provides the inspiration that fuels the Rebellion in the book. He is an allegorical combination of [[Karl Marx]], one of the creators of communism, and [[Lenin]], the communist leader of the [[Russian Revolution]] and the early Soviet nation, in that he draws up the principles of the revolution. His skull being put on revered public display recalls Lenin, whose [[Lenin's Mausoleum|embalmed body was put on display]].&lt;ref name=RoddenIntro/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hitchens/&gt; 
*[[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]] – &quot;A large, rather fierce-looking [[Berkshire (pig)|Berkshire]] boar, the only Berkshire on the farm, not much of a talker, but with a reputation for getting his own way&quot;.{{sfn|Orwell|1979|loc=chapter II|p=15}} An allegory of [[Joseph Stalin]],&lt;ref name=RoddenIntro/&gt; Napoleon is the main villain of ''Animal Farm''. In the first French version of ''Animal Farm'', Napoleon is called ''{{lang|fr|César}}'', the French form of [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]],{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}} although another translation has him as ''{{lang|fr|Napoléon}}''.&lt;ref name=NapoleonInFrench/&gt;
*[[Snowball (Animal Farm)|Snowball]] – Napoleon's rival and original head of the farm after Jones' overthrow. He is mainly based on [[Leon Trotsky]],&lt;ref name=RoddenIntro/&gt; but also combines elements from Lenin.&lt;ref name=Hitchens/&gt;
*[[Squealer (Animal Farm)|Squealer]] – A small, white, fat porker who serves as Napoleon's right-trotter pig and minister of propaganda, holding a position similar to that of [[Vyacheslav Molotov|Molotov]].&lt;ref name=RoddenIntro/&gt;
*'''Minimus''' – A poetic pig who writes the second and third national anthems of ''Animal Farm'' after the singing of &quot;Beasts of England&quot; is banned.
*'''The Piglets''' – Hinted to be the children of Napoleon and are the first generation of animals subjugated to his idea of animal inequality.
*'''The young pigs''' – Four pigs who complain about Napoleon's takeover of the farm but are quickly silenced and later executed.
*'''Pinkeye''' – A minor pig who is mentioned only once; he is the pig that tastes Napoleon's food to make sure it is not poisoned, in response to rumours about an assassination attempt on Napoleon.

===Humans===

*[[Jones (Animal Farm)|Mr Jones]] – The former owner of the farm,  Jones is a very heavy drinker. The animals revolt against him after he drinks so much that he does not feed or take care of them. He is an allegory of Russian [[Tsar Nicholas II]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= | first= | url=http://www.shmoop.com/animal-farm/fall-mister-jones-russian-revolution-1917-symbol.html | title= The Fall of Mister Jones and the Russian Revolution of 1917| publisher=Shmoop University | accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; who abdicated following the [[February Revolution]] of 1917 and was executed, along with the rest of his family, by the [[Bolsheviks]] on 17 July 1918.
*'''Mr Frederick''' – The tough owner of Pinchfield, a small but well-kept neighbouring farm, who briefly enters into an alliance with Napoleon. He is an allegory of [[Adolf Hitler]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= | first= | url=http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/animalfarm/section8.rhtml | title=SparkNotes &quot; Literature Study Guides &quot; Animal Farm &quot; Chapter VIII | publisher=SparkNotes LLC | accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= | first= | url=http://www.shmoop.com/animal-farm/scheming-frederick-how-hitler-broke-non-aggression-pact-symbol.html | title= The Scheming Frederick and how Hitler Broke the Non-Aggression Pact| publisher=Shmoop University | accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyers, p. 141&quot;&gt;Meyers, ''Readers Guide to Orwell'', p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bloom |first=Harold |authorlink=Harold Bloom |year=2009 |title=Bloom's Modern Critical Interpretations: Animal Farm - New Edition |edition=1st |url=http://books.google.de/books?id=V7C4bXGsrc8C&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=Mr+Frederick+allegory+hitler&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ICqRUdK7EcK14ASjkYGYDA&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Mr%20Frederick%20allegory%20hitler&amp;f=false |accessdate=13 May 2013 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=1604135824}}&lt;/ref&gt; who enters into [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|a neutrality pact with Joseph Stalin's USSR]] only to later break it by [[Operation Barbarossa|invading the Soviet Union]]. 
*[[Pilkington (Animal Farm)|Mr Pilkington]] – The easy-going but crafty and well-to-do owner of Foxwood, a large neighbouring farm overgrown with weeds. 
*'''Mr Whymper''' – A man hired by Napoleon to act as the liaison between Animal Farm and human society. At first he is used to acquire goods needed for the  farm, such as dog biscuits and paraffin, but later he procures luxuries like alcohol for the pigs.

===Horses and donkeys ===

*[[Boxer (Animal Farm)|Boxer]] – A loyal, kind, dedicated, hard working, and respectable cart-horse, although quite naive and gullible. Boxer does a large share of the physical labor on the farm, adhering to the simplistic belief that working harder will solve all the animal's problems.
*'''Mollie''' – A self-centered, self-indulgent and vain young white mare who quickly leaves for another farm after the revolution. She is only once mentioned again, in a manner similar to those who left Russia after the fall of the Tsar.
*'''Clover''' - A gentle, caring female horse, who shows concern especially for Boxer, who often pushes himself too hard. She seems to catch on to the sly tricks and schemes set up by Napoleon and Squealer.
*[[Benjamin (Animal Farm)|Benjamin]] – A donkey, one of the oldest, wisest animals on the farm, and one of the few who can read properly.

*'''Muriel''' – A wise old goat who is friends with all of the animals on the farm. She, like Benjamin and Snowball, is one of the few animals on the farm who can read.
*'''The Puppies''' – Offspring of Jessie and Bluebell, taken away from them by Napoleon at birth and reared by Napoleon to be his security force.
*'''Moses''' – The raven &quot;was Mr. Jones's especial pet, was a spy and a tale-bearer, but he was also a clever talker.&quot; Initially following Mrs. Jones into exile, he reappears several years later and resumes his role of talking but not working. He regales Animal Farm's denizens with tales of a wondrous place beyond the clouds called &quot;Sugarcandy Mountain, that happy country where we poor animals shall rest forever from our labours!&quot; Orwell portrays [[Religion and politics|established religion]] as &quot;the black raven of priestcraft—promising pie in the sky when you die, and faithfully serving whoever happens to be in power.&quot; Napoleon brings the raven back, (Ch. IX) as Stalin brought back the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name=Dickstein141/&gt; 
*'''The Sheep''' – They show limited understanding of the Animalism and the political atmosphere of the farm, yet nonetheless they blindly support Napoleon's ideals with vocal jingles during his speeches and meetings with Snowball.
*'''The Hens''' – The hens are among the first to rebel against Napoleon.
*'''The Cows''' – Their milk is stolen by the pigs, who learn to milk them. The milk is stirred into the pigs' mash every day, while the other animals are denied such luxuries. 
*'''The Cat''' – Never seen to carry out any work, the cat is absent for long periods, and is forgiven because her excuses are so convincing and she &quot;purred so affectionately that it was impossible not to believe in her good intentions&quot;.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt; She has no interest in the politics of the farm, and the only time she is recorded as having participated in an election, she is found to have actually &quot;voted on both sides&quot;.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;

==Composition and publication==

===Origin===
George Orwell wrote the manuscript in 1943 and 1944 subsequent to his experiences during the [[Spanish Civil War]], which he described in ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' (1938). In the preface of a 1947 Ukrainian edition of ''Animal Farm'', he explained how escaping the communist purges in Spain taught him &quot;how easily totalitarian propaganda can control the opinion of enlightened people in democratic countries&quot;. This motivated Orwell to expose and strongly condemn what he saw as the [[Stalinist]] corruption of the original socialist ideals.{{sfn|Orwell|1947|p=}}

Immediately prior to his writing, Orwell had quit the [[BBC]]. He was also upset about a booklet for propagandists the Ministry of Information had put out. The booklet included instructions on how to quell ideological fears of the Soviet Union, such as directions to claim that the Red Terror was a figment of Nazi imagination.&lt;ref&gt;[[Overy, Richard]], ''Why the Allies Won'', p. 297 ISBN 0-393-03925-0&lt;/ref&gt;

In the preface, Orwell also described the source of the idea of setting the book on a farm:{{sfn|Orwell|1947|p=}}
{{quote
| ...I saw a little boy, perhaps ten years old, driving a huge carthorse along a narrow path, whipping it whenever it tried to turn. It struck me that if only such animals became aware of their strength we should have no power over them, and that men exploit animals in much the same way as the rich exploit the proletariat.
}}

===Efforts to find a publisher===
Orwell encountered great difficulty getting the manuscript published, as it was feared that the book might upset the alliance between the US, UK, and the Soviet Union. Four publishers refused; one had initially accepted the work but declined after consulting the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]].{{sfn|Dag|2004|p=}}&lt;ref&gt;[[#GOIT|Orwell 1976 page 25 ''La libertà di stampa'']]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, [[Secker and Warburg]] published the first edition in 1945.

During [[World War II]], it became apparent to Orwell that anti-Soviet literature was not something which most major publishing houses would touch — including his regular publisher [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]]. He also submitted the manuscript to [[Faber and Faber]], where the poet [[T. S. Eliot]] (who was a director of the firm) rejected it; Eliot wrote back to Orwell praising its &quot;good writing&quot; and &quot;fundamental integrity&quot;, but declared that they would only accept it for publication if they had some sympathy for the viewpoint &quot;which I take to be generally [[Deformed workers' state|Trotskyite]]&quot;. Eliot said he found the view &quot;not convincing&quot;, and contended that the pigs were made out to be the best to run the farm; he posited that someone might argue &quot;what was needed.. was not more communism but more public-spirited pigs&quot;.&lt;ref name=Eliot/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1969-01-06-09-004&amp;pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1969-01-06-09|title=T.S. Eliot and Animal Farm: Reasons for Rejection|last=Eliot|first=Valery|date=6 January 1969|work=The Times |location=UK |accessdate=8 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Orwell let [[André Deutsch]], who was working for Nicholson &amp; Watson in 1944, read the typescript, and Deutsch was convinced that Nicholson &amp; Watson would want to publish it; however, they did not, and &quot;lectured Orwell on what they perceived to be errors in ''Animal Farm''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Davison, editorial note, Orwell, Collected Works, ''I Have Tried to Tell the Truth'',p.156&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''London Letter'' on 17 April 1944 for ''[[Partisan Review]]'', Orwell wrote that it was &quot;now next door to impossible to get anything overtly anti-Russian printed. Anti-Russian books do appear, but mostly from Catholic publishing firms and always from a religious or frankly reactionary angle.&quot;

The publisher [[Jonathan Cape]], who had initially accepted ''Animal Farm'', subsequently rejected the book after an official at the British [[UK Ministry of Information|Ministry of Information]] warned him off&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; — although the civil servant who it is assumed gave the order was later found to be a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[spy]].{{sfn|Taylor|2003|p=337}} Writing to [[Leonard Moore (literary agent)|Leonard Moore]], a partner in the literary agency of Christy &amp; Moore, publisher Jonathan Cape explained that the decision had been taken on the advice of a senior official in the Ministry of Information. Such flagrant anti-Soviet bias was unacceptable, and the choice of pigs as the dominant class was thought to be especially offensive. It may reasonably be assumed that the 'important official' was a man named [[Peter Smollett]], who was later unmasked as a Soviet agent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orwell Subverted p.3&quot;&gt;''Orwell Subverted'', Daniel J. Leab, Penn State Press, 2007 p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Orwell was suspicious of Smollett/Smolka, and he would be one of the names Orwell [[Orwell's list|included in his list]] of Crypto-Communists and Fellow-Travellers sent to the Information Research Department in 1949. Born Hans Peter Smolka in Vienna in 1912, he came to Britain in 1933 as an [[NKVD]] agent with the codename 'Abo',&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Orwell'', p. 210; The Mitrokhin Archive, The KGB in Europe and the West, Christopher Andrew and Vasili Mitrokhin, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; became a naturalised British subject in 1938, changed his name, and after the outbreak of World War II joined the Ministry of Information where he organised pro-Soviet propaganda, working with [[Kim Philby]] in 1943-45.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordievsky, Oleg]]. ''KGB: The Inside Story'', 1991, p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; Smollett's family have rejected the accusation that he was a spy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orwell Subverted p.3&quot;/&gt; The publisher wrote to Orwell, saying:&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;
{{quote |
If the fable were addressed generally to dictators and dictatorships at large then publication would be all right, but the fable does follow, as I see now, so completely the progress of the Russian Soviets and their two dictators [Lenin and Stalin], that it can apply only to Russia, to the exclusion of the other dictatorships.

Another thing: it would be less offensive if the predominant caste in the fable were not pigs. I think the choice of pigs as the ruling caste will no doubt give offence to many people, and particularly to anyone who is a bit touchy, as undoubtedly the Russians are.
}}

[[Frederic Warburg]] also faced pressures against publication, even from people in his own office and from his wife Pamela, who felt that it was not the moment for ingratitude towards Stalin and the heroic [[Red Army]],&lt;ref&gt;''George Orwell, A Personal Memoir'', T. R. Fyvel, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; which had played a major part in defeating Hitler. A Russian translation was printed in the paper ''Posev'', and in giving permission for a Russian translation of ''Animal Farm'', Orwell refused in advance all royalties. A translation in Ukrainian, which was produced in Germany, was confiscated in large part by the American wartime authorities and handed over to the Soviet repatriation commission.&lt;ref&gt;[[Struve, Gleb]]. ''Telling the Russians'', written for the Russian journal ''New Russian Wind'', reprinted in Remembering Orwell, p.260-261&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1945, Orwell wrote to Fredric Warburg expressing interest in pursuing the possibility that the political cartoonist [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]] might illustrate ''Animal Farm''. Low had written a letter saying that he had had &quot;a good time with ''ANIMAL FARM'' - an excellent bit of satire - it would illustrate perfectly.&quot; Nothing came of this, and a trial issue produced by Secker &amp; Warburg in 1956 illustrated by John Driver was abandoned, but the [[Folio Society]] published an edition in 1984 illustrated by [[Quentin Blake]] and an edition illustrated by the cartoonist [[Ralph Steadman]] was published by Secker &amp; Warburg in 1995 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the first edition of ''Animal Farm''.&lt;ref&gt;Smothered Under Journalism, p.123 &amp; I Belong to the Left, p.313-314&lt;/ref&gt;

===&quot;The Freedom of the Press&quot;===
Orwell originally wrote a preface complaining about British [[self-censorship]] and how the British people were suppressing criticism of the USSR, their World War II ally. &quot;The sinister fact about [[literary censorship]] in England is that it is largely voluntary.... Things are kept right out of the British press, not because the Government intervenes but because of a general tacit agreement that 'it wouldn't do' to mention that particular fact.&quot; Although the first edition allowed space for the preface, it was not included,{{sfn|Dag|2004|p=}} and as of June 2009 it has not been published with most editions of the book.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ba|Bailey83221]] (Bailey83221 includes a preface and two cites: 26 August 1995 ''The Guardian'' page 28; 1995-08-26 ''New Statesman &amp; Society'' 8 (366): 11. ISSN: 0954-2361)&lt;/ref&gt;

Secker and Warburg published the first edition of ''Animal Farm'' in 1945 without any introduction. However, the publisher had provided space for a preface in the author's proof composited from the manuscript. For reasons unknown, no preface was supplied, and all the page numbers needed to be redone at the last minute.&lt;ref name=GOIT15/&gt;&lt;ref name=TFOTP/&gt;

Years later, in 1972, Ian Angus found the original typescript titled &quot;The Freedom of the Press&quot;, and Bernard Crick published it, together with his own introduction, in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' on 15 September 1972&lt;ref name=GOIT15/&gt; as &quot;How the essay came to be written&quot;.&lt;ref name=TFOTP/&gt; Orwell's essay criticised British self-censorship by the press, specifically the suppression of unflattering descriptions of Stalin and the Soviet government.&lt;ref name=TFOTP/&gt; The same essay also appeared in the Italian 1976 Animal Farm edition, with another introduction by Crick, claiming to be the first edition with the preface.&lt;ref name=GOIT15/&gt; Other publishers were still declining to publish it.{{Clarify|date=March 2010|reason=more details needed, were some actively refusing, unaware of the preface?}}

==Critical response==
Contemporary reviews of the work were not universally positive. Writing in the American ''[[The New Republic|New Republic]]'' magazine, George Soule expressed his disappointment in the book, writing that it &quot;puzzled and saddened me. It seemed on the whole dull. The allegory turned out to be a creaking machine for saying in a clumsy way things that have been said better directly.&quot; Soule believed that the animals were not consistent enough with their real world inspirations, and said, &quot;It seems to me that the failure of this book (commercially it is already assured of tremendous success) arises from the fact that the satire deals not with something the author has experienced, but rather with stereotyped ideas about a country which he probably does not know very well&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Soule, G. (2 September 1946). &quot;Orwell's Fables&quot;. ''The New Republic'', pp. 266–267. {{Verify credibility|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tosco Fyvel]], writing in ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'', 24 August 1945, called the book &quot;a gentle satire on a certain State and on the illusions of an age which may already be behind us.&quot; [[Julian Symons]] responded, on 7 September, &quot;Should we not expect, in ''Tribune'' at least, acknowledgement of the fact that it is a satire not at all gentle upon a particular State - [[Soviet Russia]]? It seems to me that a reviewer should have the courage to identify Napoleon with Stalin, and Snowball with Trotsky, and express an opinion favourable or unfavourable to the author, upon a political ground. In a hundred years time perhaps, ''Animal Farm'' may be simply a fairy story, today it is a political satire with a good deal of point.&quot;

''Animal Farm'' has been subject to much comment in the decades since these early remarks.&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, ''Collected Works, I Belong to the Left'', p.253&lt;/ref&gt; It is now highly regarded, having received universal praise and is often considered one of the greatest books of the 20th century.{{by whom|date=September 2013}}

==Analysis==

===Animalism===
{{redirect|Seven Commandments|the Noahide code|Seven Laws of Noah}}

The pigs Snowball, Napoleon, and Squealer adapt Old Major's ideas into &quot;a complete system of thought&quot;, which they formally name Animalism, an allegoric reference to [[Communism]]. Soon after, Napoleon and Squealer partake in activities associated with the humans (drinking alcohol, sleeping in beds, trading), which were explicitly prohibited by the Seven Commandments. Squealer is employed to alter the Seven Commandments to account for this humanisation, an [[allusion]] to the Soviet government's revising of history in order to exercise control of the people's beliefs about themselves and their society.&lt;ref name=Rodden1999/&gt;
[[File:Animal Farm artwork.jpg|thumb|right|230px| Squealer sprawls at the foot of the end wall of the big barn where the Seven Commandments were written (ch. viii)—preliminary artwork for a 1950 strip cartoon by [[Norman Pett]] and Donald Freeman]]

The original commandments are:
# Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.
# Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.
# No animal shall wear clothes.
# No animal shall sleep in a bed.
# No animal shall drink alcohol.
# No animal shall kill any other animal.
# All animals are equal.

Later, Napoleon and his pigs secretly revise some commandments to clear themselves of accusations of law-breaking. The changed commandments are as follows, with the changes bolded:
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No animal shall sleep in a bed '''with sheets.'''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No animal shall drink alcohol '''to excess.'''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No animal shall kill any other animal '''without cause.'''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Eventually, these are replaced with the maxims, &quot;All animals are equal, '''but some animals are more equal than others'''&quot;, and &quot;Four legs good, two legs '''better!'''&quot; as the pigs become more human. This is an [[Irony|ironic]] twist to the original purpose of the Seven Commandments, which were supposed to keep order within Animal Farm by uniting the animals together against the humans and preventing animals from following the humans' evil habits. Through the revision of the commandments, Orwell demonstrates how simply political dogma can be turned into malleable propaganda.&lt;ref name=Carr2010/&gt;

===Significance and allegory===
[[File:Animalism flag.svg|thumb|The Horn and Hoof Flag described in the book appears to be based on the [[hammer and sickle]].]]

In the [[Eastern Bloc]], both ''Animal Farm'' and later ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' were on the list of forbidden books until the end of [[communism]] in 1989, and were only available via clandestine [[Samizdat]] networks.{{citation needed|date = August 2012}}

Orwell biographer Jeffrey Meyers has written, &quot;virtually every detail has political significance in this allegory.&quot; Orwell himself wrote in 1946, &quot;Of course I intended it primarily as a satire on the Russian revolution..[and] ''that kind'' of revolution (violent conspiratorial revolution, led by unconsciously power hungry people) can only lead to a change of masters [-] revolutions only effect a radical improvement when the masses are alert.&quot;&lt;ref name=OrwellLIL334/&gt; In a preface for a 1947 Ukrainian edition, he stated, &quot;...&amp;nbsp;for the past ten years I have been convinced that the destruction of the Soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival of the socialist movement. On my return from Spain [in 1937] I thought of exposing the Soviet myth in a story that could be easily understood by almost anyone and which could be easily translated into other languages.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Crick, Bernard. ''Orwell, A Life'', p. 450&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolt of the animals against Farmer Jones is Orwell's analogy with the [[October Revolution|October 1917 Bolshevik Revolution]], and Jones's attempt to regain control, with the aid of neighbouring farmers, parallels the Western powers' efforts 1918-21 to crush the Bolsheviks. The pigs' rise to pre-eminence mirrors the rise of a Stalinist bureaucracy in the USSR, just as Napoleon's emergence as the farm's sole leader reflects Stalin's emergence. The pigs' appropriation of milk and apples for their own use, &quot;the turning point of the story&quot; as Orwell termed it in a letter to [[Dwight Macdonald]],&lt;ref name=OrwellLIL334&gt;Orwell, George. ''A Life in Letters'', Penguin ISBN 978-0-141-19263-5 p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; stands as an analogy for the crushing of the left-wing 1921 [[Kronstadt rebellion|Kronstadt revolt]] against the Bolsheviks,&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, Letter to Dwight Macdonald, 5 December 1946, ''A Life in Letters'', p.334 Penguin 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and the difficult efforts of the animals to build the windmill suggest the various [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five Year Plans]]. The puppies controlled by Napoleon parallel the nurture of the secret police in the Stalinist structure, and the pigs' treatment of the other animals on the farm recalls the internal terror faced by the populace in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;''Orwell Subverted'', 6–7 Daniel Leab, Penn State Press 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter seven, when the animals confess their nonexistent crimes and are killed, Orwell directly alludes to the purges, confessions and [[Moscow show trials|show trials]] of the late 1930s. These contributed to Orwell's conviction that the Bolshevik revolution had been corrupted and the Soviet system become rotten.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Companion to George Orwell, p. 135, CUP 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Edgerly Firchow]] and [[Peter Davison (professor)|Peter Davison]] consider that in real life, with events in ''Animal Farm'' mirroring those in the [[Soviet Union]], the ''Battle of the Windmill'' represents the [[Great Patriotic War]] ([[World War II]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Edgerly Firchow 2008&quot; /&gt; especially the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] and the [[Battle of Moscow]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Hobley Davison 1996&quot; /&gt; During the battle, Fredrick drills a hole and places [[explosive]]s inside, and then &quot;All the animals, including Napoleon&quot; took cover; Orwell had the publisher alter this to &quot;All the animals except Napoleon&quot; in recognition of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s decision to remain in Moscow during the German advance.&lt;ref&gt;A Reader's Guide to George Orwell, Jeffrey Meyers, Thames &amp; Hudson, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; This very particular alteration had been occasioned by Orwell having been in Paris in March 1945, working as a war correspondent for the ''[[The Observer|Observer]]'' and the ''[[Manchester Evening News]]''. In Paris he met Joseph Czapski, a survivor of the [[Katyn Massacre]]. In spite of Czapski's opposition to the Soviet regime, he told Orwell, as Orwell wrote to [[Arthur Koestler]], that it had been &quot;the character [and] greatness of Stalin&quot; that saved Russia from the German invasion.&lt;ref&gt;A Note on the Text, Peter Davison, ''Animal Farm'', Penguin edition 1989, p. xx&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Battle of the Cowshed'' represents the allied invasion of the [[Russian SFSR|Soviet Russia]] in 1918,&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Hobley Davison 1996&quot; /&gt; and the defeat of the [[White movement|White Russians]] in the [[Russian Civil War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Edgerly Firchow 2008&quot; /&gt;
[[File:XV съезд ВКП(б) - Рыков, Скрыпник, Сталин.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Front row (left to right): [[Alexey Rykov|Rykov]], [[Mykola Skrypnyk|Skrypnyk]], and [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]—'When Snowball comes to the crucial points in his speeches he is drowned out by the sheep (Ch. V), just as in the [[15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|party Congress in 1927]] [above], at Stalin's instigation 'pleas for the opposition were drowned in the continual, hysterically intolerant uproar from the floor'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaac Deutscher]], Stalin, p. 311, Jeffrey Meyers, ''A Readers Guide to George Orwell'', p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Other connections that writers have suggested illustrate Orwell's telescoping of Russian history from 1917 to 1943&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Meyers, ''A Readers Guide to George Orwell'', p. 135. In the Preface to ''Animal Farm'' Orwell noted however, 'although various episodes are taken from the actual history of the Russian Revolution, they are dealt with schematically and their chronological order is changed.'&lt;/ref&gt; include the wave of rebelliousness that ran through the countryside after the Rebellion, which stands for the abortive revolutions [[Hungarian Revolution of 1919|in Hungary]] and [[German Revolution of 1918–19|in Germany]] (Ch IV); the conflict between Napoleon and Snowball (Ch V), paralleling &quot;the two rival and quasi-Messianic beliefs that seemed pitted against one another: [[Trotskyism]], with its faith in the [[Permanent revolution|revolutionary vocation]] of the proletariat of the West; and Stalinism with its glorification of [[socialism in one country|Russia's socialist destiny]]&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Deutscher, quoted in Jeffrey Meyers, ''Readers Guide to George Orwell'', p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon's dealings with Whymper and the Willingdon markets (Ch VI), paralleling the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1922)|Treaty of Rapallo]]; and Frederick's bank notes, paralleling the [[Treaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union|Hitler-Stalin non-aggression pact of August 1939]], which are forgeries. Frederick attacks Animal Farm without warning and destroys the windmill.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyers, p. 141&quot;/&gt;

The book's close, with the pigs and men in a kind of rapprochement, reflected Orwell's view of the 1943 [[Teheran Conference]]&lt;ref&gt;Preface to the Ukrainian edition of ''Animal Farm'',reprinted in Orwell:Collected Works, ''It Is What I Think'' p.89&lt;/ref&gt; that seemed to display the establishment of &quot;the best possible relations between the USSR and the West&quot;—but in reality were destined, as Orwell presciently predicted, to continue to unravel.&lt;ref&gt;''Orwell Subverted'', p. 7, Daniel J. Leab, Penn State Press 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The disagreement between the allies and the start of the [[Cold War]] is suggested when Napoleon and Pilkington, both suspicious, &quot;played an ace of spades simultaneously&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Meyers, ''A Reader's Guide to George Orwell'' p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
A BBC radio version, produced by [[Rayner Heppenstall]], was broadcast in January 1947. Orwell listened to the production at his home in Canonbury Square in London, with [[Hugh Gordon Porteus|Hugh Gordon Porteous]], amongst others. Orwell later wrote to Heppenstall that Porteous, &quot;who had not read the book, grasped what was happening after a few minutes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Orwell'', edited by Peter Davison, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; A further radio production, again using Orwell's own dramatisation of the book, was broadcast in January 2013 on BBC [[Radio Four]]. [[Tamsin Greig]] narrated and the cast included [[Nicky Henson]] as Napoleon, [[Toby Jones]] as the propagandist Squealer, and [[Ralph Ineson]] as Boxer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01q7fzf Radio Times, 26 January-1 February 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Animal Farm'' has been adapted to film twice. The [[Animal Farm (1954 film)|1954 ''Animal Farm'' film]] was an animated feature and the [[Animal Farm (1999 film)|1999 ''Animal Farm'' film]] was a TV live action version. Both differ from the novel, and have been accused of taking significant liberties, including sanitising some aspects. In the 1954 version, Napoleon is apparently overthrown in a second revolution. The 1999 film shows Napoleon's regime collapsing in on itself, with the farm having new human owners, as happened in the Soviet Union, appropriating the new political reality to the story. In 2012, a HFR-3D version of ''Animal Farm'' potentially directed by [[Andy Serkis]] was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Giardina |first=Carolyn |title=Andy Serkis to Direct Adaptation of 'Animal Farm' |date=19 October 2012 |work=hollywoodreporter.com |publisher=The Hollywood Reporter |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/andy-serkis-animal-farm-381314 |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A theatrical version, with music by Richard Peaslee and lyrics by [[Adrian Mitchell]], was staged at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] London on 25 April 1984, directed by [[Peter Hall (director)|Peter Hall]]. It toured nine cities in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, ''A Life in Letters'', Penguin Books 2011, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; A solo version, adapted and performed by Guy Masterson, premièred at the [[Traverse Theatre]] Edinburgh in January 1995 and has toured worldwide since.&lt;ref&gt;Lancashire Telegraph, 25 January 2013 [http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/leisure/whats_on/10187002.One_man_Animal_Farm_show_on_the_way_to_Darwen/] Theatre Tours International [http://www.theatretoursinternational.com/PastShows/PSDomestic/PSAFgm.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 July 2009, [[Amazon.com]] withdrew certain [[Amazon Kindle]] titles, including ''Animal Farm'' and ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' by [[George Orwell]], from sale, refunded buyers, and remotely deleted items from purchasers' devices after discovering that the publisher lacked rights to publish the titles in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pogue |first=David |url=http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/17/some-e-books-are-more-equal-than-others/ |title=Some E-Books Are More Equal Than Others |publisher=Pogue.blogs.nytimes.com |date=17 July 2009 |accessdate=24 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notes and annotations for the books made by users on their devices were also deleted.&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt; After the move prompted outcry and comparisons to ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' itself, Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener stated that the company is &quot;[c]hanging our systems so that in the future we will not remove books from customers' devices in these circumstances.&quot;&lt;ref name=statement/&gt;

'''Amphibians''' are [[ectotherm]]ic, [[tetrapod]] [[vertebrate]]s of the [[Class (biology)|class]] '''Amphibia''' (Greek ἀμφí, ''amphi'', &quot;both&quot; + βíος, ''bios'', &quot;life&quot;). They inhabit a wide variety of [[habitat|habitats]] with most species living within [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]], [[fossorial]], [[arboreal]] or freshwater [[Aquatic animal|aquatic]] [[ecosystems]]. Amphibians typically start out as [[larva]] living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. The young generally undergo [[metamorphosis]] from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial [[salamander]]s and [[frog]]s lack lungs and rely entirely upon skin. They are superficially similar to [[reptile]]s but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are [[amniotes]] and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often [[ecological indicator]]s and in recent decades there has been a dramatic [[decline in amphibian populations]] for many species around the globe.

The earliest amphibians evolved in the [[Devonian Period]] from [[sarcopterygian]] fish with lungs and bony-limbed fins, features that were helpful in adapting to dry land. They diversified and became dominant during the [[Carboniferous]] and [[Permian]] periods, but were later displaced by reptiles and other vertebrates. Over time, amphibians shrank in size and decreased in diversity, leaving only the modern subclass [[Lissamphibia]]. The three modern orders of amphibians are [[Anura (frog)|Anura]] (the frogs and toads), [[Caudata]]/Urodela (the salamanders), and Gymnophiona/Apoda (the [[caecilian]]s). The total number of known amphibian species is approximately 7,000, of which nearly 90% are frogs. The smallest amphibian (and vertebrate) in the world is a frog from [[New Guinea]] (''[[Paedophryne amauensis]]'') with a length of just {{convert|7.7|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The largest living amphibian is the {{convert|1.8|m|0|abbr=on}} [[Chinese giant salamander]] (''Andrias davidianus'') but this is dwarfed by the extinct {{convert|9|m|0|abbr=on}} ''[[Prionosuchus]]'' from the middle Permian of Brazil. The study of amphibians is called [[batrachology]], while the study of both reptiles and amphibians is called [[herpetology]].

The first major groups of amphibians developed in the [[Devonian|Devonian period]], around 370 million years ago, from [[Sarcopterygii|lobe-finned fish]] similar to the modern [[coelacanth]] and [[lungfish]],&lt;ref name=&quot;evoamphib&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.waikato.ac.nz/evolution/AnimalEvolution.shtml#evolutionofamphibian |title=Evolution of amphibians |publisher=University of Waikato: Plant and animal evolution |accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had evolved multi-jointed leg-like fins with digits that enabled them to crawl along the sea bottom. Some fish had developed primitive lungs to help them breathe air when the stagnant pools of the Devonian swamps were low in oxygen. They could also use their strong fins to hoist themselves out of the water and onto dry land if circumstances so required. Eventually, their bony fins would [[evolution|evolve]] into limbs and they would become the ancestors to all [[tetrapod]]s, including modern amphibians, [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[mammal]]s. Despite being able to crawl on land, many of these prehistoric [[tetrapodomorph]] fish still spent most of their time in the water. They had started to develop lungs, but still breathed predominantly with gills.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carroll&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Patterns of Evolution, as Illustrated by the Fossil Record |last=Carroll |first=Robert L. |author2=Hallam, Anthony (Ed.)|year=1977 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-444-41142-6 |pages=405–420 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=q7GjDIyyWegC&amp;pg=PA405&amp;dq=Amphibian+evolution#v=onepage&amp;q=Amphibian%20evolution&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Ichthyostega]]'' was one of the first primitive amphibians, with nostrils and more efficient lungs. It had four sturdy limbs, a neck, a tail with fins and a skull very similar to that of the lobe-finned fish, ''[[Eusthenopteron]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;evoamphib&quot; /&gt; Amphibians evolved adaptations that allowed them to stay out of the water for longer periods. Their lungs improved and their skeletons became heavier and stronger, better able to cope with the increased gravitational effect of life on land. They developed &quot;hands&quot; and &quot;feet&quot; with five or more digits;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ichthyostega&quot; /&gt; the skin became more capable of retaining body fluids and resisting desiccation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carroll&quot; /&gt; The fish's [[hyomandibula]] bone in the [[hyoid bone|hyoid]] region behind the gills diminished in size and became the [[stapes]] of the amphibian ear, an adaptation necessary for hearing on dry land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lombard, R. E.; Bolt, J. R. |year=1979 |title=Evolution of the tetrapod ear: an analysis and reinterpretation |journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=19–76 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.1979.tb00027.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; An affinity between the amphibians and the [[teleost]] fish is the multi-folded structure of the teeth and the paired [[Occipital bone|supra-occipital bones]] at the back of the head, neither of these features being found elsewhere in the animal kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spoczynska&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Diplocaulus vale21DB.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=''Diplocaulus''|The Permian lepospondyl ''[[Diplocaulus]]'' was largely aquatic]]
At the end of the Devonian period (360 million years ago), the seas, rivers and lakes were teeming with life while the land was the realm of early plants and devoid of vertebrates,&lt;ref name=&quot;Spoczynska&quot;/&gt; though some, such as ''Ichthyostega'', may have sometimes hauled themselves out of the water. It is thought they may have propelled themselves with their forelimbs, dragging their hindquarters in a similar manner to that used by the [[elephant seal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ichthyostega&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tolweb.org/Ichthyostega |title=''Ichthyostega'' |author=Clack, Jennifer A. |year=2006 |work=Tree of Life Web Project |accessdate=September 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early [[Carboniferous]] (360 to 345 million years ago), the climate became wet and warm. Extensive swamps developed with [[moss]]es, [[fern]]s, [[horsetail]]s and [[calamites]]. Air-breathing [[arthropod]]s evolved and invaded the land where they provided food for the [[Carnivore|carnivorous]] amphibians that began to adapt to the terrestrial environment. There were no other tetrapods on the land and the amphibians were at the top of the food chain, occupying the ecological position currently held by the crocodile. Though equipped with limbs and the ability to breathe air, most still had a long tapering body and strong tail.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spoczynska&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Fossils: A Study in Evolution |last=Spoczynska |first=J. O. I. |year=1971 |publisher=Frederick Muller Ltd |isbn=978-0-584-10093-8 |pages=120–125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were the top land predators, sometimes reaching several metres in length, preying on the large insects of the period and the many types of fish in the water. They still needed to return to water to lay their shell-less eggs, and even most modern amphibians have a fully aquatic larval stage with gills like their fish ancestors. It was the development of the [[amniote|amniotic]] egg, which prevents the developing embryo from drying out, that enabled the reptiles to reproduce on land and which led to their [[Dominance (ecology)|dominance]] in the period that followed.&lt;ref name=&quot;evoamphib&quot;/&gt;

During the [[Triassic|Triassic Period]] (250 to 200 million years ago), the reptiles began to out-compete the amphibians, leading to a reduction in both the amphibians' size and their importance in the [[biosphere]]. According to the fossil record, [[Lissamphibia]], which includes all modern amphibians and is the only surviving lineage, may have branched off from the extinct groups [[Temnospondyli]] and [[Lepospondyli]] at some period between the Late Carboniferous and the Early Triassic. The relative scarcity of fossil evidence precludes precise dating,&lt;ref name=&quot;Carroll&quot; /&gt; but the most recent molecular study, based on [[multilocus sequence typing]], suggests a Late Carboniferous/Early [[Permian]] origin of extant amphibians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=San Mauro|first=D. |year=2010|title=A multilocus timescale for the origin of extant amphibians|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |volume=56 |pages=554–561 |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2010.04.019 |pmid=20399871|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins and evolutionary relationships between the three main groups of amphibians is a matter of debate. A 2005 molecular phylogeny, based on [[Ribosomal DNA|rDNA]] analysis, suggests that salamanders and caecilians are more closely related to each other than they are to frogs. It also appears that the divergence of the three groups took place in the [[Paleozoic]] or early [[Mesozoic]] (around 250 million years ago), before the breakup of the supercontinent [[Pangaea]] and soon after their divergence from the lobe-finned fish. The briefness of this period, and the swiftness with which radiation took place, would help account for the relative scarcity of primitive amphibian fossils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=San Mauro, Diego; Vences, Miguel; Alcobendas, Marina; Zardoya, Rafael; Meyer, Axel |year=2005 |title=Initial diversification of living amphibians predated the breakup of Pangaea |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=165 |issue=5 |pages=590–599 |doi=10.1086/429523 |pmid=15795855 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are large gaps in the [[fossil record]], but the discovery of a proto-frog from the Early Permian in Texas in 2008 provided a missing link with many of the characteristics of modern frogs. [[Molecular phylogenetics|Molecular analysis]] suggests that the frog–salamander divergence took place considerably earlier than the [[Paleontology|palaeontological]] evidence indicates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anderson, J.; Reisz, R.; Scott, D.; Fröbisch, N.; Sumida, S. |year=2008 |title=A stem batrachian from the Early Permian of Texas and the origin of frogs and salamanders |journal=Nature |volume=453 |issue= 7194|pages=515–518 |doi=10.1038/nature06865 |pmid= 18497824 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As they evolved from lunged fish, amphibians had to make certain adaptations for living on land including the need to develop new means of locomotion. In the water, the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward but on land, quite different mechanisms were required. Their vertebral columns, limbs, limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding. Terrestrial adults discarded their [[lateral line]] systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of air. They needed to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature. They developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in a terrestrial environment. Their skins were exposed to harmful [[ultraviolet]] rays that had previously been absorbed by the water. The skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | pp=843&amp;ndash;859 }}

{{see also|List of amphibians}}
The word &quot;Amphibian&quot; is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] term ἀμφίβιος (''amphíbios''), which means &quot;both kinds of life&quot;, ''ἀμφί'' meaning &quot;of both kinds&quot; and ''βιος'' meaning &quot;life&quot;. The term was initially used as a general adjective for animals that could live on land or in water, including seals and otters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Concise Etymological Dictionary of the English Language |last=Skeat |first=Walter W.  |year=1897 |publisher=Clarendon Press  |page=39 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the class Amphibia includes all tetrapod vertebrates that are not amniotes. Amphibia in its widest sense (''[[sensu lato]]'') was divided into three [[Class (biology)|subclasses]], two of which are extinct:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Baird, Donald |year=1965 |title=Paleozoic lepospondyl amphibians |journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=287&amp;ndash;294 |doi=10.1093/icb/5.2.287 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual number of species in each group depends on the taxonomic classification followed. The two most common systems are the classification adopted by the website AmphibiaWeb, [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California (Berkeley)]] and the classification by [[Herpetology|herpetologist]] [[Darrel Frost]] and the [[American Museum of Natural History]], available as the online reference database [[List of amphibians|Amphibian Species of the World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://research.amnh.org/vz/herpetology/amphibia/ |title= American Museum of Natural History: Amphibian Species of the World 5.6, an Online Reference |author=Frost, Darrel |year=2013 |publisher=The American Museum of Natural History |accessdate=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The numbers of species cited above follow Frost and the total number of known amphibian species is over 7,000, of which nearly 90% are frogs.&lt;ref name=&quot;species&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Crump, Martha L. |year=2009 |title=Amphibian diversity and life history |journal=Amphibian Ecology and Conservation.

With the [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] classification, the taxon Labyrinthodontia has been discarded as it is a [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]] group without unique defining features apart from [[Cladistics#plesiomorphy|shared primitive characteristics]]. Classification varies according to the preferred phylogeny of the author and whether they use a [[Cladistics#Three definitions of clade|stem-based or a node-based]] classification. Traditionally, amphibians as a class are defined as all tetrapods with a larval stage, while the group that includes the common ancestors of all living amphibians (frogs, salamanders and caecilians) and all their descendants is called Lissamphibia. The phylogeny of Paleozoic amphibians is uncertain, and Lissamphibia may possibly fall within extinct groups, like the Temnospondyli (traditionally placed in the subclass Labyrinthodontia) or the Lepospondyli, and in some analyses even in the amniotes. This means that advocates of [[phylogenetic nomenclature]] have removed a large number of [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] Devonian and Carboniferous amphibian-type tetrapod groups that were formerly placed in Amphibia in [[Linnaean taxonomy]], and included them elsewhere under [[cladistic taxonomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Blackburn, D.

All modern amphibians are included in the subclass Lissamphibia, which is usually considered a [[clade]], a group of species that have evolved from a common ancestor. The three modern orders are Anura (the frogs and toads), Caudata (or Urodela, the salamanders), and Gymnophiona (or Apoda, the caecilians).{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | p=3 }} It has been suggested that salamanders arose separately from a Temnospondyl-like ancestor, and even that caecilians are the sister group of the advanced [[reptiliomorpha|reptiliomorph]] amphibians, and thus of amniotes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson&quot; /&gt; Although the fossils of several older proto-frogs with primitive characteristics are known, the oldest &quot;true frog&quot; is ''[[Prosalirus bitis]]'', from the [[Early Jurassic]] [[Kayenta Formation]] of Arizona.

Authorities disagree as to whether Salientia is a superorder that includes the order Anura, or whether Anura is a sub-order of the order Salientia. The Lissamphibia are traditionally divided into three [[Order (biology)|orders]], but an extinct salamander-like family, the [[Albanerpetontidae]], is now considered part of the Lissamphibia alongside the superorder Salientia. Furthermore, Salientia includes all three recent orders plus the Triassic proto-frog, ''[[Triadobatrachus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tolweb.org/Salientia/14938 |title=Salientia |author=Cannatella, David |year=2008 |work=Tree of Life Web Project |accessdate=August 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amphibians are ectothermic (cold-blooded) vertebrates that do not maintain their body temperature through internal [[Physiology|physiological]] processes. Their [[Basal metabolic rate|metabolic rate]] is low and as a result, their food and energy requirements are limited. In the adult state, they have tear ducts and movable eyelids, and most species have ears that can detect airborne or ground vibrations. They have muscular tongues, which in many species can be protruded. Modern amphibians have fully [[Ossification|ossified]] vertebrae with [[articular processes]]. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little [[keratin]] and lacks scales, apart from a few fish-like scales in certain caecilians. The skin contains many [[mucous gland]]s and in some species, poison glands. The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two [[atrium (heart)|atria]] and one [[ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]. They have a [[urinary bladder]] and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as [[urea]]. Most amphibians lay their eggs in water and have aquatic larvae that undergo metamorphosis to become terrestrial adults. Amphibians breathe by means of a pump action in which air is first drawn into the [[Buccopharyngeal membrane|buccopharyngeal]] region through the nostrils. These are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=24&amp;ndash;25 }} They supplement this with [[gas exchange]] through the skin.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | pp=843&amp;ndash;859 }}

The suborder [[Cryptobranchoidea]] contains the primitive salamanders. A number of fossil cryptobranchids have been found, but there are only three living species, the Chinese giant salamander (''Andrias davidianus''), the [[Japanese giant salamander]] (''Andrias japonicus'') and the [[hellbender]] (''Cryptobranchus alleganiensis'') from North America. These large amphibians retain several larval characteristics in their adult state; gills slits are present and the eyes are unlidded.

The suborder [[Salamandroidea]] contains the advanced salamanders. They differ from the cryptobranchids by having fused [[Mandible|prearticular bones]] in the lower jaw, and by using internal fertilisation.

The third suborder, [[Sirenoidea]], contains the four species of sirens, which are in a single family, [[Sirenidae]].

Some of their features are primitive while others are derived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cogger, H. G.; Zweifel, R. G (Ed.) |year=1998 |title=Encyclopedia of Reptiles and Amphibians |publisher= Academic Press |pages= 69–70 |isbn=978-0-12-178560-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fertilisation is likely to be external as sirenids lack the cloacal glands used by male salamandrids to produce spermatophores and the females lack [[spermatheca]]e for sperm storage. Despite this, the eggs are laid singly, a behaviour not conducive for external fertilisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;BritCaudata&quot; /&gt;

=== Gymnophiona ===
[[File:Siphonops paulensis02.jpg|thumb|alt=''Siphonops paulensis''|The limbless South American caecilian ''[[Siphonops paulensis]]'']]
The order [[Gymnophiona]] (from the Greek ''gymnos'' meaning &quot;naked&quot; and ''ophis'' meaning &quot;serpent&quot;) or Apoda (from the Latin ''an-'' meaning &quot;without&quot; and the Greek ''poda'' meaning &quot;legs&quot;) comprises the caecilians. These are long, cylindrical, limbless animals with a [[snake]]- or [[Annelid|worm-like]] form. The adults vary in length from 8 to 75 centimetres (3 to 30 inches) with the exception of [[Caecilia thompsoni|Thomson's caecilian]] (''Caecilia thompsoni'') which can reach {{convert|150|cm|ft|abbr=off}}. A caecilian's skin has a large number of transverse folds and in some species contains tiny embedded dermal scales. It has rudimentary eyes covered in skin, which are probably limited to discerning differences in light intensity. It also has a pair of short [[tentacle]]s near the eye that can be extended and which have [[Somatosensory system|tactile]] and [[Olfaction|olfactory]] functions. Most caecilians live underground in burrows in damp soil, in rotten wood and under plant debris, but some are aquatic.{{sfn| Stebbins| Cohen | 1995 | p=4}} Most species lay their eggs underground and when the larvae hatch, they make their way to adjacent bodies of water. Others brood their eggs and the larvae undergo metamorphosis before the eggs hatch. A few species give birth to live young, nourishing them with glandular secretions while they are in the oviduct.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=858}} Caecilians are found in tropical Africa, Asia and Central and South America.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/29797/Gymnophiona |title=Gymnophiona |author=Duellman, William E. |work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Skin ===
[[File:Tree frog congo.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Common reed frog|The bright colours of the [[Common Reed Frog|common reed frog]] (''Hyperolius viridiflavus'') show that it is a toxic species]]
The [[Wikt:integument|integumentary]] structure contains some typical characteristics common to terrestrial vertebrates, such as the presence of highly [[Keratin#Cornification|cornified]] outer layers, renewed periodically through a moulting process controlled by the [[pituitary]] and [[thyroid]] glands. Local thickenings (often called warts) are common, such as those found on toads. The outside of the skin is shed periodically more or less in one piece, in contrast to mammals and birds where it is shed in flakes. Amphibians often eat the sloughed skin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins&quot; /&gt; Caecilians are unique among amphibians in having mineralized dermal scales embedded in the [[dermis]] between the furrows in the skin. The similarity of these to the scales of bony fish is largely superficial. [[Squamata|Lizards]] and some frogs have somewhat similar [[osteoderm]]s forming bony deposits in the dermis, but this is an example of [[convergent evolution]] with similar structures having arisen independently in diverse vertebrate lineages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zylberberg, Louise; Wake, Marvalee H. |year=1990 |title=Structure of the scales of ''Dermophis'' and ''Microcaecilia'' (Amphibia: Gymnophiona), and a comparison to dermal ossifications of other vertebrates |journal=Journal of Morphology |volume=206 |issue=1 |pages=25–43 |doi=10.1002/jmor.1052060104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amphibian skin is permeable to water. Gas exchange can take place through the skin and this allows adult amphibians to respire without rising to the surface of water and to hibernate at the bottom of ponds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins&quot; /&gt; To compensate for their thin and delicate skin, amphibians have evolved mucous glands, principally on their heads, backs and tails. The secretions produced by these help keep the skin moist. In addition, most species of amphibian have granular glands that secrete distasteful or poisonous substances. Some amphibian toxins can be lethal to humans while others have little effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;amphibfacts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Amphibian_morphology_and_reproduction |title=Amphibian morphology and reproduction |date=October 12, 2008 |author=Biodiversity Institute of Ontario; Hebert, Paul D. N. |work=Encyclopedia of Earth |accessdate=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main poison-producing glands, the [[Parotoid gland|paratoids]], produce the neurotoxin [[bufotoxin]] and are located behind the ears of toads, along the backs of frogs, behind the eyes of salamanders and on the upper surface of caecilians.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=10&amp;ndash;11 }}

The skin colour of amphibians is produced by three layers of pigment cells called [[chromatophore]]s. These three cell layers consist of the melanophores (occupying the deepest layer), the guanophores (forming an intermediate layer and containing many granules, producing a blue-green colour) and the lipophores (yellow, the most superficial layer). The colour change displayed by many species is initiated by [[hormone]]s secreted by the [[pituitary gland]]. Unlike bony fish, there is no direct control of the pigment cells by the nervous system, and this results in the colour change taking place more slowly than happens in fish. A vividly coloured skin usually indicates that the species is toxic and is a warning sign to predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Integument: A Textbook of Skin Biology |last=Spearman |first=R.

=== Skeletal system and locomotion ===
Amphibians have a skeletal system that is structurally [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to other tetrapods, though with a number of variations. They all have four limbs except for the legless caecilians and a few species of salamander with reduced or no limbs. The bones are hollow and lightweight. The musculoskeletal system is strong to enable it to support the head and body. The bones are fully [[ossification|ossified]] and the vertebrae interlock with each other by means of overlapping processes. The [[pectoral girdle]] is supported by muscle, and the well-developed [[pelvic girdle]] is attached to the backbone by a pair of sacral ribs. The [[ilium (bone)|ilium]] slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammals.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=846 }}

[[File:Ceratophrys cornuta skeleton front.jpg|thumb|alt=Frog skeleton|Skeleton of [[Surinam horned frog]]&lt;br&gt;(''Ceratophrys cornuta'')]]
In most amphibians, there are four digits on the fore foot and five on the hind foot, but no claws on either. Some salamanders have fewer digits and the [[amphiuma]]s are eel-like in appearance with tiny, stubby legs. The sirens are aquatic salamanders with stumpy forelimbs and no hind limbs. The caecilians are limbless. They burrow in the manner of earthworms with zones of muscle contractions moving along the body. On the surface of the ground or in water they move by undulating their body from side to side.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=26&amp;ndash;36 }}

In frogs, the hind legs are larger than the fore legs, especially so in those species that principally move by jumping or swimming. In the walkers and runners the hind limbs are not so large, and the burrowers mostly have short limbs and broad bodies. The feet have adaptations for the way of life, with webbing between the toes for swimming, broad adhesive toe pads for climbing, and keratinised tubercles on the hind feet for digging (frogs usually dig backwards into the soil). In most salamanders, the limbs are short and more or less the same length and project at right angles from the body. Locomotion on land is by walking and the tail often swings from side to side or is used as a prop, particularly when climbing. In their normal gait, only one leg is advanced at a time in the manner adopted by their ancestors, the lobe-finned fish.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=846 }} Some salamanders in the genus ''[[Aneides]]'' and certain [[lungless salamander|plethodontids]] climb trees and have long limbs, large toepads and prehensile tails.&lt;ref name=&quot;BritCaudata&quot; /&gt; In aquatic salamanders and in frog tadpoles, the tail has [[dorsal fin|dorsal]] and [[ventral fin|ventral]] fins and is moved from side to side as a means of propulsion. Adult frogs do not have tails and caecilians have only very short ones.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=26&amp;ndash;36 }}

Salamanders use their tails in defence and some are prepared to jettison them to save their lives in a process known as [[autotomy]]. Certain species in the Plethodontidae have a weak zone at the base of the tail and use this strategy readily. The tail often continues to twitch after separation which may distract the attacker and allow the salamander to escape. Both tails and limbs can be regenerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Beneski, John T. Jr. | year=1989 | title=Adaptive significance of tail autotomy in the salamander, ''Ensatina'' | journal=Journal of Herpetology | volume=23 | issue=3 | pages=322–324 | doi=10.2307/1564465 | jstor=1564465 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adult frogs are unable to regrow limbs but tadpoles can do so.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=26&amp;ndash;36 }}

=== Circulatory system ===
[[File:Siphonops annulatus.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Ringed caecilian|The [[Siphonops annulatus|ringed caecilian]] (''Siphonops annulatus'') resembles an earthworm]]
Amphibians have a juvenile stage and an adult stage, and the circulatory systems of the two are distinct. In the juvenile (or tadpole) stage, the circulation is similar to that of a fish; the two-chambered heart pumps the blood through the gills where it is oxygenated, around the body and back to the heart in a single loop. In the adult stage, amphibians (especially frogs) lose their gills and develop lungs. They have a heart that consists of a single ventricle and two atria. When the ventricle starts contracting, deoxygenated blood is pumped through the [[pulmonary artery]] to the lungs. Continued contraction then pumps oxygenated blood around the rest of the body. Mixing of the two bloodstreams is minimized by the anatomy of the chambers.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=306 }}

=== Nervous and sensory systems ===
The [[nervous system]] is basically the same as in other vertebrates, with a central brain, a spinal cord, and nerves throughout the body. The amphibian brain is less well developed than that of reptiles, birds and mammals but is similar in morphology and function to that of a fish. It consists of equal parts [[cerebrum]], [[midbrain]] and [[cerebellum]]. Various parts of the cerebrum process sensory input, such as smell in the olfactory lobe and sight in the optic lobe, and it is additionally the centre of behaviour and learning. The cerebellum is the centre of muscular coordination and the [[medulla oblongata]] controls some organ functions including heartbeat and respiration. The brain sends signals through the spinal cord and nerves to regulate activity in the rest of the body. The [[pineal body]], known to regulate sleep patterns in humans, is thought to produce the hormones involved in [[hibernation]] and [[aestivation]] in amphibians.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | p=100 }}

Tadpoles retain the lateral line system of their ancestral fishes but this is lost in terrestrial adult amphibians. Some caecilians possess [[Electroreception|electroreceptors]] that allow them to locate objects around them when submerged in water. The ears are well developed in frogs. There is no external ear, but the large circular [[Tympanum (anatomy)|eardrum]] lies on the surface of the head just behind the eye. This vibrates and sound is transmitted through a single bone, the [[stapes]], to the inner ear. Only high frequency sounds like mating calls are heard in this way but low frequency noises can be detected through another mechanism.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=846 }} There is a patch of specialized haircells, called ''papilla amphibiorum'', in the inner ear capable of detecting deeper sounds. Another feature, unique to frogs and salamanders, is the columella-operculum complex adjoining the auditory capsule which is involved in the transmission of both airborne and seismic signals.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | p=69 }} The ears of salamanders and caecilians are less highly developed than those of frogs as they do not normally communicate with each other through the medium of sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;EBAmphibia&quot; /&gt;

The eyes of tadpoles lack lids but at metamorphosis, the [[cornea]] becomes more dome-shaped, the [[Lens (anatomy)|lens]] becomes flatter, and [[eyelid]]s and associated glands and ducts develop.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=846 }} The adult eyes are an improvement on invertebrate eyes and were a first step in the development of more advanced vertebrate eyes. They allow colour vision and depth of focus. In the retinas are green rods, which are receptive to a wide range of wavelengths.&lt;ref name=&quot;EBAmphibia&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/21445/amphibian/ |title=Amphibian |author=Duellman, William E.; Zug, George R. |year=2012 |work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=March 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digestive and excretory systems ===
[[File:Frog anatomy tags.PNG|thumb|alt=Dissected frog|Dissected frog:1&amp;nbsp;Right&amp;nbsp;atrium, 2&amp;nbsp;Lungs, 3&amp;nbsp;Aorta, 4&amp;nbsp;Egg mass, 5&amp;nbsp;Colon, 6&amp;nbsp;Left&amp;nbsp;atrium, 7&amp;nbsp;Ventricle, 8&amp;nbsp;Stomach, 9&amp;nbsp;Liver, 10&amp;nbsp;Gallbladder, 11&amp;nbsp;Small&amp;nbsp;intestine, 12&amp;nbsp;Cloaca]]
Many amphibians catch their prey by flicking out an elongated tongue with a sticky tip and drawing it back into the mouth before seizing the item with their jaws. Some use inertial feeding to help them swallow the prey, repeatedly thrusting their head forward sharply causing the food to move backwards in their mouth by [[inertia]]. Most amphibians swallow their prey whole without much chewing so they possess voluminous stomachs. The short [[oesophagus]] is lined with [[cilia]] that help to move the food to the stomach and [[mucus]] produced by glands in the mouth and [[pharynx]] eases its passage. The enzyme [[chitinase]] produced in the stomach helps digest the [[chitin]]ous cuticle of arthropod prey.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=847 }}

Amphibians possess a [[pancreas]], [[liver]] and [[gall bladder]]. The liver is usually large with two lobes. Its size is determined by its function as a [[glycogen]] and fat storage unit, and may change with the seasons as these reserves are built or used up. [[Adipose tissue]] is another important means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen, under the skin and, in some salamanders, in the tail.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | p=66 }}
&lt;!--In aquatic amphibians, the liver plays only a small role in processing nitrogen for excretion, and [[ammonia]] is diffused mainly through the skin. The liver of terrestrial amphibians converts ammonia to urea, a less toxic, water-soluble nitrogenous compound, as a means of water conservation. In some species, urea is further converted into [[uric acid]]. [[Bile]] secretions from the liver collect in the gall bladder and flow into the small intestine. In the small intestine, enzymes digest carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Salamanders lack a valve separating the small intestine from the large intestine. Salt and water absorption occur in the large intestine, as well as mucous secretion to aid in the transport of faecal matter, which is passed out through the [[cloaca]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Anatomy&quot; /&gt;---Omitting this until a more reliable source can be found.---&gt;

There are two [[kidney]]s located dorsally, near the roof of the body cavity. Their job is to filter the blood of metabolic waste and transport the urine via ureters to the urinary bladder where it is stored before being passed out periodically through the cloacal vent. Larvae and most aquatic adult amphibians excrete the nitrogen as ammonia in large quantities of dilute urine, while terrestrial species, with a greater need to conserve water, excrete the less toxic product urea. Some tree frogs with limited access to water excrete most of their metabolic waste as uric acid.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=849 }}

=== Respiratory system ===
[[File:Axolotl ganz.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Axolotl|The [[axolotl]] (''Ambystoma mexicanum'') retains its larval form with gills into adulthood]]
The lungs in amphibians are primitive compared to those of amniotes, possessing few internal [[alveolar septum|septa]] and large [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]], and consequently having a comparatively slow diffusion rate for oxygen entering the blood. Ventilation is accomplished by [[buccal pumping]]. Most amphibians, however, are able to exchange gases with the water or air via their skin. To enable sufficient cutaneous respiration, the surface of their highly vascularized skin must remain moist to allow the oxygen to diffuse at a sufficiently high rate.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=847 }} Because oxygen concentration in the water increases at both low temperatures and high flow rates, aquatic amphibians in these situations can rely primarily on cutaneous respiration, as in the [[Telmatobius culeus|Titicaca water frog]] and the [[Cryptobranchus|hellbender salamander]]. In air, where oxygen is more concentrated, some small species can rely solely on cutaneous gas exchange, most famously the [[Plethodontidae|plethodontid salamanders]], which have neither lungs nor gills. Many aquatic salamanders and all tadpoles have gills in their larval stage, with some (such as the [[axolotl]]) retaining gills as aquatic adults.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=847 }}

== Reproduction ==
[[File:Litoria xanthomera amplexus.jpg|thumb|alt=Orange-thighed frogs in amplexus|Male [[Orange-thighed Frog|orange-thighed frog]] (''Litoria xanthomera'') grasping the female during [[amplexus]]]]
For the purpose of [[Biological reproduction|reproduction]] most amphibians require [[fresh water]] although some lay their eggs on land and have developed various means of keeping them moist. A few (e.g. ''[[Fejervarya raja]]'') can inhabit brackish water but there are no true [[marine (ocean)|marine]] amphibians. There are reports however of particular amphibian populations unexpectedly invading marine waters. Such was the case with the [[Black Sea]] invasion of the natural hybrid ''[[Pelophylax esculentus]]'' reported in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Natchev, Nikolay; Tzankov, Nikolay; Geme, Richard |year=2011 |title=Green frog invasion in the Black Sea: habitat ecology of the ''Pelophylax esculentus'' complex (Anura, Amphibia) population in the region of Shablenska Тuzla lagoon in Bulgaria |journal=Herpetology Notes |volume=4 |pages=347–351 |url=http://www.herpetologynotes.seh-herpetology.org/Volume4_PDFs/Natchev_et_al_Herpetology_Notes_Volume4_pages347-351.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several hundred frog species in [[adaptive radiation]]s (e.g., ''[[Eleutherodactylus]]'', the Pacific Platymantines, the Australo-Papuan microhylids, and many other tropical frogs), however, do not need any water for [[breeding in the wild]]. They reproduce via direct development, an ecological and evolutionary adaptation that has allowed them to be completely independent from free-standing water. Almost all of these frogs live in wet [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical rainforests]] and their eggs hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult, passing through the [[tadpole]] stage within the egg. Reproductive success of many amphibians is dependent not only on the quantity of rainfall, but the seasonal timing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Abiotic_factor?topic=49461 |title=Abiotic factor |author=Hogan, C. Michael |date=July 31, 2010 |work=Encyclopedia of Earth |publisher=National Council for Science and the Environment |accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the tropics, many amphibians breed continuously or at any time of year. In temperate regions, breeding is mostly seasonal, usually in the spring, and is triggered by increasing day length, rising temperatures or rainfall. Experiments have shown the importance of temperature but the trigger event, especially in arid regions, is often a storm. In anurans, males usually arrive at the breeding sites before females and the vocal chorus they produce may stimulate ovulation in females and the endocrine activity of males that are not yet reproductively active.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=140&amp;ndash;141 }}

In caecilians, fertilisation is internal, the male extruding an [[intromittent organ]], the phallodeum, and inserting it into the female cloaca. The paired Müllerian glands inside the male cloaca secrete a fluid which resembles that produced by mammalian [[prostate]] glands and which may transport and nourish the sperm. Fertilisation probably takes place in the oviduct.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duellman&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Biology of Amphibians |last=Duellman|first=Willia E. |author2= Trueb, Linda |year=1994 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=978-0-8018-4780-6 |pages=77–79 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=CzxVvKmrtIgC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=phallodeum#v=onepage&amp;q=phallodeum&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of salamanders also engage in internal fertilisation. In most of these, the male deposits a spermatophore, a small packet of sperm on top of a gelatinous cone, on the [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] either on land or in the water. The female takes up the sperm packet by grasping it with the lips of the cloaca and pushing it into the vent. The spermatozoa move to the spermatheca in the roof of the cloaca where they remain until ovulation which may be many months later. Courtship rituals and methods of transfer of the spermatophore vary between species. In some, the spermatophore may be placed directly into the female cloaca while in others, the female may be guided to the spermatophore or restrained with an embrace called [[amplexus]]. Certain primitive salamanders in the families Sirenidae, [[Hynobiidae]] and [[Cryptobranchidae]] practice external fertilisation in a similar manner to frogs, with the female laying the eggs in water and the male releasing sperm onto the egg mass.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duellman&quot; /&gt;

With a few exceptions, frogs use external fertilisation. The male grasps the female tightly with his forelimbs either behind the arms or in front of the back legs, or in the case of ''[[Epipedobates tricolor]]'', around the neck. They remain in amplexus with their cloacae positioned close together while the female lays the eggs and the male covers them with sperm. Roughened nuptial pads on the male's hands aid in retaining grip. Often the male collects and retains the egg mass, forming a sort of basket with the hind feet. An exception is the [[granular poison frog]] (''Oophaga granulifera'') where the male and female place their cloacae in close proximity while facing in opposite directions and then release eggs and sperm simultaneously. The [[tailed frog]] (''Ascaphus truei'') exhibits internal fertilisation. The &quot;tail&quot; is only possessed by the male and is an extension of the cloaca and used to inseminate the female. This frog lives in fast-flowing streams and internal fertilisation prevents the sperm from being washed away before fertilisation occurs.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=154&amp;ndash;162 }} The sperm may be retained in storage tubes attached to the [[oviduct]] until the following spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Ascaphus&amp;where-species=truei |title=''Ascaphus truei'' |author=Adams, Michael J.; Pearl, Christopher A. |year=2005 |publisher=AmphibiaWeb |accessdate=November 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most frogs can be classified as either prolonged or explosive breeders. Typically, prolonged breeders congregate at a breeding site, the males usually arriving first, calling and setting up territories. Other satellite males remain quietly nearby, waiting for their opportunity to take over a territory. The females arrive sporadically, mate selection takes place and eggs are laid. The females depart and territories may change hands. More females appear and in due course, the breeding season comes to an end. Explosive breeders on the other hand are found where temporary pools appear in dry regions after rainfall. These frogs are typically [[wikt:fossorial|fossorial]] species that emerge after heavy rains and congregate at a breeding site. They are attracted there by the calling of the first male to find a suitable place, perhaps a pool that forms in the same place each rainy season. The assembled frogs may call in unison and frenzied activity ensues, the males scrambling to mate with the usually smaller number of females.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=154&amp;ndash;162 }}

== Life cycle ==
Most amphibians go through [[metamorphosis]], a process of significant morphological change after birth. In typical amphibian development, eggs are laid in water and larvae are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle. Frogs, toads and salamanders all hatch from the egg as larvae with external gills. Metamorphosis in amphibians is regulated by [[thyroxine]] concentration in the blood, which stimulates metamorphosis, and [[prolactin]], which counteracts thyroxine's effect. Specific events are dependent on threshold values for different tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Kikuyama | first1 = Sakae

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because most embryonic development is outside the parental body, it is subject to many adaptations due to specific environmental circumstances. For this reason tadpoles can have horny ridges instead of teeth, whisker-like skin extensions or fins. They also make use of a sensory lateral line organ similar to that of fish. After metamorphosis, these organs become redundant and will be reabsorbed by controlled cell death, called [[apoptosis]]. The variety of adaptations to specific environmental circumstances among amphibians is wide, with many discoveries still being made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Newman, Robert A. |year=1992 |title=Adaptive plasticity in amphibian metamorphosis |journal=BioScience |volume=42 |issue=9 |pages=671–678 |doi= 10.2307/1312173 |jstor=1312173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eggs ===
[[File:Frogspawn closeup.jpg|thumb|alt=Frogspawn|Frogspawn, a mass of eggs surrounded by jelly]]

The egg of an amphibian is typically surrounded by a transparent gelatinous covering secreted by the oviducts and containing [[mucoprotein]]s and [[mucopolysaccharide]]s. This capsule is permeable to water and gases, and swells considerably as it absorbs water. The ovum is at first rigidly held but in fertilised eggs, the innermost layer liquefies and allows the [[embryo]] to move freely. This also happens in salamander eggs even when they are unfertilised. Eggs of some salamanders and frogs contain unicellular green algae. These penetrate the jelly envelope after the eggs are laid and may increase the supply of oxygen to the embryo through photosynthesis.

Caecilians, some plethodontid salamanders and certain frogs that lay eggs underground have unpigmented eggs. In the [[Wood Frog|wood frog]] (''Rana sylvatica''), the interior of the globular egg cluster has been found to be up to {{convert|6|°C|°F|abbr=on}} warmer than its surroundings which is an advantage in its cool northern habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Waldman, Bruce; Ryan, Michael J.|year=1983 |title=Thermal advantages of communal egg mass deposition in wood frogs (''Rana sylvatica'') |journal=Journal of Herpetology |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=70–72 |jstor=1563783 |doi=10.2307/1563783}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eggs may be deposited singly or in small groups, or may take the form of spherical egg masses, rafts or long strings. In terrestrial caecilians, the eggs are laid in grape-like clusters in burrows near streams. The amphibious salamander ''[[Ensatina]]'' attaches its similar clusters by stalks to underwater stems and roots. The [[Eleutherodactylus planirostris|greenhouse frog]] (''Eleutherodactylus planirostris'') lays eggs in small groups in the soil where they develop in about two weeks directly into juvenile frogs without an intervening larval stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amphibiaweb.org/cgi-bin/amphib_query?query_src=aw_search_index&amp;where-genus=Eleutherodactylus&amp;where-species=planirostris |title=''Eleutherodactylus planirostris'' |author=Meshaka, Walter E.

=== Larvae ===
[[File:Frog spawn time-lapse.gif|thumb|left|alt=Frog spawn development|Early stages in the development of the embryos of the [[common frog]] (''Rana temporaria'')]]
The eggs of amphibians are typically laid in water and hatch into free-living larvae that complete their development in water and later transform into either aquatic or terrestrial adults. In many species of frog and in most lungless salamanders (Plethodontidae), direct development takes place, the larvae growing within the eggs and emerging as miniature adults. Many caecilians and some other amphibians lay their eggs on land, and the newly hatched larvae wriggle or are transported to water bodies. Some caecilians, the [[Alpine salamander]] (''Salamandra atra'') and some of the [[Nectophrynoides|African live-bearing toads]] (''Nectophrynoides spp.'') are [[Vivipary|viviparous]]. Their larvae feed on glandular secretions and develop within the female's oviduct, often for long periods. Other amphibians, but not caecilians, are [[Ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]]. The eggs are retained in or on the parent's body but the larvae subsist on the yolks of their eggs and receive no nourishment from the adult. The larvae emerge at varying stages of their growth, either before or after metamorphosis, according to their species.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=6&amp;ndash;9 }} The toad genus ''Nectophrynoides'' exhibits all of these developmental patterns among its dozen or so members.&lt;ref name=&quot;species&quot;/&gt;

==== Frogs ====
Frog larvae are known as tadpoles and typically have oval bodies and long, vertically flattened tails with fins. The free living larvae are normally fully aquatic but the tadpoles of some species such as (''[[Nannophrys ceylonensis]]'') are semi-terrestrial and live among wet rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amphibiaweb.org/cgi-bin/amphib_query?query_src=aw_lists_genera_&amp;table=amphib&amp;where-genus=Nannophrys&amp;where-species=ceylonensis |title=''Nannophrys ceylonensis'' |author=Janzen, Peter |date=May 10, 2005 |publisher=AmphibiaWeb |accessdate=July 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tadpoles have cartilaginous skeletons, gills for respiration (external gills at first, internal gills later), [[lateral line system]]s and large tails that they use for swimming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-40603/Anura |title=Anura: From tadpole to adult |author=Duellman, W. E.; Zug, G. R. |work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=July 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newly hatched tadpoles soon develop gill pouches that cover the gills. The lungs develop early and are used as accessory breathing organs, the tadpoles rising to the water surface to gulp air. Some species complete their development inside the egg and hatch directly into small frogs. These larvae do not have gills but instead have specialised areas of skin through which respiration takes place. While tadpoles do not have true teeth, in most species, the jaws have long, parallel rows of small keratinized structures called keradonts surrounded by a horny beak.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=179&amp;ndash;181 }} Front legs are formed under the gill sac and hind legs become visible a few days later. Tadpoles are typically [[herbivore|herbivorous]], feeding mostly on [[alga]]e, including [[diatom]]s filtered from the water through the [[gill]]s. They are also [[detritivore]]s, stirring up the sediment at the pond bottom and ingesting edible fragments. They have a relatively long, spiral-shaped gut to enable them to digest this diet.&lt;ref name=&quot;EBAnura&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/29023/Anura |title=Anura |author=Duellman, William E.; Zug, George R. |year=2012 |work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some species are carnivorous at the tadpole stage, eating insects, smaller tadpoles and fish. Young of the [[Cuban tree frog]] (''Osteopilus septentrionalis'') can occasionally be [[Cannibalism|cannibalistic]], the younger tadpoles attacking a larger, more developed tadpole when it is undergoing metamorphosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Crump, Martha L. |year=1986 |title=Cannibalism by younger tadpoles: another hazard of metamorphosis |journal=Copeia |volume=4 |pages=1007–1009 |jstor=1445301 |doi=10.2307/1445301 |issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wide image|Bufobufotadpoles.jpg|800px|alt=Metamorphosis|Successive stages in the development of [[common toad]] (''Bufo bufo'') tadpoles, finishing with metamorphosis}}
At metamorphosis, rapid changes in the body take place as the lifestyle of the frog changes completely. The spiral‐shaped mouth with horny tooth ridges is reabsorbed together with the spiral gut. The animal develops a large jaw, and its gills disappear along with its gill sac. Eyes and legs grow quickly, and a tongue is formed. There are associated changes in the neural networks such as development of stereoscopic vision and loss of the lateral line system. All this can happen in about a day. A few days later, the tail is reabsorbed, due to the higher thyroxine concentration required for this to take place.&lt;ref name=&quot;EBAnura&quot; /&gt;

==== Salamanders ====
[[File:Ambystoma macrodactylum 26597.JPG|thumb|alt=Larva of the Long-toed Salamander|Larva of the [[long-toed salamander]] &lt;br&gt;(''Ambystoma macrodactylum'')]]
[[File:Mesotriton alpestris apuanus04.jpg|thumb|alt=Larvae of the Alpine newt|Larvae of the [[Alpine newt]] &lt;br&gt;(''Ichthyosaura alpestris'')]]
At hatching, a typical salamander larva has eyes without lids, teeth in both upper and lower jaws, three pairs of feathery external gills, a somewhat laterally flattened body and a long tail with [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorsal]] and [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|ventral]] fins. The forelimbs may be partially developed and the hind limbs are rudimentary in pond-living species but may be rather more developed in species that reproduce in moving water. Pond-type larvae often have a pair of balancers, rod-like structures on either side of the head that may prevent the gills from becoming clogged up with sediment. Some members of the genera ''[[Ambystoma]]'' and ''[[Dicamptodon]]'' have larvae that never fully develop into the adult form but this varies with species and with populations. The [[Northwestern Salamander|northwestern salamander]] (''Ambystoma gracile'') is one of these and, depending on environmental factors, either remains permanently in the larval state, a condition known as [[neoteny]], or transforms into an adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Valentine, Barry D.; Dennis, David M. | year=1964 | title=A comparison of the gill-arch system and fins of three genera of larval salamanders, ''Rhyacotriton'', ''Gyrinophilus'', and ''Ambystoma'' | journal=Copeia | volume=1964 | issue=1 | pages=196–201 | jstor=1440850 | doi=10.2307/1440850 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these are able to breed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amphibiaweb.org/cgi-bin/amphib_query?where-genus=Ambystoma&amp;where-species=gracile |title=''Ambystoma gracile'' |author=Shaffer, H. Bradley |year=2005 |publisher=AmphibiaWeb |accessdate=November 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neoteny occurs when the animal's growth rate is very low and is usually linked to adverse conditions such as low water temperatures that may change the response of the tissues to the hormone thyroxine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pages.uoregon.edu/titus/herp_old/neoteny.htm |title=Metamorphosis vs. neoteny (paedomorphosis) in salamanders (Caudata) |author=Kiyonaga, Robin R |accessdate=November 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors that may inhibit metamorphosis include lack of food, lack of trace elements and competition from [[conspecific]]s. The [[tiger salamander]] (''Ambystoma tigrinum'') also sometimes behaves in this way and may grow particularly large in the process. The adult tiger salamander is terrestrial, but the larva is aquatic and able to breed while still in the larval state. When conditions are particularly inhospitable on land, larval breeding may allow continuation of a population that would otherwise die out. There are fifteen species of [[wikt:obligate|obligate]] neotenic salamanders, including species of ''[[Necturus]]'', ''[[Olm|Proteus]]'' and ''Amphiuma'', and many examples of [[wikt:facultative|facultative]] ones that adopt this strategy under appropriate environmental circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Biology of Amphibians |last=Duellman |first=William E. |author2=Trueb, Linda |year=1994 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=978-0-8018-4780-6 |pages=191–192 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=CzxVvKmrtIgC&amp;pg=PA191&amp;lpg=PA191&amp;dq=salamander+obligate+neoteny#v=onepage&amp;q=salamander%20obligate%20neoteny&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lungless salamanders in the family Plethodontidae are terrestrial and lay a small number of unpigmented eggs in a cluster among damp leaf litter. Each egg has a large yolk sac and the larva feeds on this while it develops inside the egg, emerging fully formed as a juvenile salamander. The female salamander often broods the eggs. In the genus ''[[Ensatinas]]'', the female has been observed to coil around them and press her throat area against them, effectively massaging them with a mucous secretion.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | p=196 }}

In newts and salamanders, metamorphosis is less dramatic than in frogs. This is because the larvae are already carnivorous and continue to feed as predators when they are adults so few changes are needed to their digestive systems. Their lungs are functional early but the larvae don't make as much use of them as do tadpoles. Their gills are never covered by gill sacs and are reabsorbed just before the animals leave the water. Other changes include the reduction in size or loss of tail fins, the closure of gill slits, thickening of the skin, the development of eyelids, and certain changes in dentition and tongue structure. Salamanders are at their most vulnerable at metamorphosis as swimming speeds are reduced and transforming tails are encumbrances on land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shaffer, H. Bradley; Austin, C. C.; Huey, R. B. |year=1991 |title=The consequences of metamorphosis on salamander (''Ambystoma'') locomotor performance |journal=Physiological Zoology |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=212–231 |jstor=30158520 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adult salamanders often have an aquatic phase in spring and summer, and a land phase in winter. For adaptation to a water phase, prolactin is the required hormone, and for adaptation to the land phase, thyroxine. External gills do not return in subsequent aquatic phases because these are completely absorbed upon leaving the water for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/100353/Caudata |title=Caudata |author=Wake, David B. |year=2012 |work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Caecilians ====
[[File:CaecilianNHM.png|thumb|left|alt=''Ichthyophis glutinosus''|The caecilian ''Ichthyophis glutinosus'' with eggs and developing embryo]]
Most terrestrial caecilians that lay eggs do so in burrows or moist places on land near bodies of water. The development of the young of ''[[Ichthyophis glutinosus]]'', a species from Sri Lanka, has been much studied. The eel-like larvae hatch out of the eggs and make their way to water. They have three pairs of external red feathery gills, a blunt head with two rudimentary eyes, a lateral line system and a short tail with fins. They swim by undulating their body from side to side. They are mostly active at night, soon lose their gills and make sorties onto land. Metamorphosis is gradual. By the age of about ten months they have developed a pointed head with sensory tentacles near the mouth and lost their eyes, lateral line systems and tails. The skin thickens, embedded scales develop and the body divides into segments. By this time, the caecilian has constructed a burrow and is living on land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Breckenridge, W. R.; Nathanael, S.; Pereira, L. |year=1987 |title=Some aspects of the biology and development of ''Ichthyophis glutinosus'' |journal=Journal of Zoology |volume=211 |pages=437–449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the majority of species of caecilians, the young are produced by vivipary. ''[[Typhlonectes compressicauda]]'', a species from South America, is typical of these. Up to nine larvae can develop in the oviduct at any one time. They are elongated and have paired sac-like gills, small eyes and specialised scraping teeth. At first, they feed on the yolks of the eggs but as this source of nourishment declines they begin to rasp at the ciliated epithelial cells that line the oviduct. This stimulates the secretion of fluids rich in [[lipid]]s and mucoproteins on which they feed along with scrapings from the oviduct wall. They may increase their length sixfold and be two-fifths as long as their mother before being born. By this time they have undergone metamorphosis, lost their eyes and gills, developed a thicker skin and mouth tentacles, and reabsorbed their teeth. A permanent set of teeth grow through soon after birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wake, Marvalee H. |year=1977 |title=Fetal maintenance and its evolutionary significance in the Amphibia: Gymnophiona |journal=Journal of Herpetology |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=379–386 |jstor=1562719 |doi=10.2307/1562719 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/29797/Gymnophiona |title=Gymnophiona |author=Duellman, William E. |year=2012 |work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ringed caecilian (''[[Siphonops annulatus]]'') has developed a unique adaptation for the purposes of reproduction. The progeny feed on a skin layer that is specially developed by the adult in a phenomenon known as maternal dermatophagy. The brood feed as a batch for about seven minutes at intervals of approximately three days which gives the skin an opportunity to regenerate. Meanwhile they have been observed to ingest fluid exuded from the maternal cloaca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wilkinson, Mark; Kupfer, Alexander; Marques-Porto, Rafael; Jeffkins, Hilary; Antoniazzi, Marta M.; Jared, Carlos |year=2008 |title= One hundred million years of skin feeding?

=== Parental care ===
[[File:Panama Poison Dart Frog Colostethus panamensis with tadpoles.jpg|thumb|alt=Common rocket frog|Male [[common rocket frog]] (''Colostethus panamensis'') carrying tadpoles on his back]]

The care of offspring among amphibians has been little studied but, in general, the larger the number of eggs in a batch, the less likely it is that any degree of parental care takes place. Nevertheless, it is estimated that in up to 20% of amphibian species, one or both adults play some role in the care of the young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crump| first=Martha L.| year=1996| title=Parental care among the Amphibia| journal=Advances in the Study of Behavior| volume=25| pages=109–144| doi=10.1016/S0065-3454(08)60331-9 | series=Advances in the Study of Behavior| isbn=9780120045259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those species that breed in smaller water bodies or other specialised habitats tend to have complex patterns of behaviour in the care of their young.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1086/650727 | last1=Brown | first1=J.

Many woodland salamanders lay clutches of eggs under dead logs or stones on land. The [[Black Mountain Salamander|black mountain salamander]] (''Desmognathus welteri'') does this, the mother brooding the eggs and guarding them from predation as the embryos feed on the yolks of their eggs. When fully developed, they break their way out of the egg capsules and disperse as juvenile salamanders.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | pp=853&amp;ndash;854 }} The male hellbender, a primitive salamander, excavates an underwater nest and encourages females to lay there. The male then guards the site for the two or three months before the eggs hatch, using body undulations to fan the eggs and increase their supply of oxygen.&lt;ref name=&quot;EHSAR&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Alytes obstetricans almogavarii - male with eggs 2.jpg|thumb|left|Male [[common midwife toad]] (''Alytes obstetricans'') carrying eggs]]
The male ''[[Colostethus subpunctatus]]'', a tiny frog, protects the egg cluster which is hidden under a stone or log. When the eggs hatch, the male transports the tadpoles on his back, stuck there by a mucous secretion, to a temporary pool where he dips himself into the water and the tadpoles drop off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Fandiño, María Claudia; Lüddecke, Horst; Amézquita, Adolfo |year=1997 |title=Vocalisation and larval transportation of male ''Colostethus subpunctatus'' (Anura: Dendrobatidae) |journal=Amphibia-Reptilia |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=39–48 |doi=10.1163/156853897X00297 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The male [[Common midwife toad|midwife toad]] (''Alytes obstetricans'') winds egg strings round his thighs and carries the eggs around for up to eight weeks.

== Feeding and diet ==
[[File:Pacific brown salamander eating a worm.jpg|thumb|alt=Northwestern Salamander|[[Northwestern Salamander|Northwestern salamander]] &lt;br&gt;(''Ambystoma gracile'') eating a worm]]
With a few exceptions, adult amphibians are [[Predation|predators]], feeding on virtually anything that moves that they can swallow. The diet mostly consists of small prey that do not move too fast such as beetles, caterpillars, earthworms and spiders. The sirens (''[[Siren (genus)|Siren spp.]]'') often ingest aquatic plant material with the invertebrates on which they feed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Siren_intermedia.html |title=''Siren intermedia'': Lesser Siren |author=Gabbard, Jesse |year=2000 |work=Animal Diversity Web |publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Zoology |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Brazilian tree frog ''[[Xenohyla truncata]]'' includes a large quantity of fruit in its diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Da Silva, H. R.; De Britto-Pereira, M. C. |year=2006 |title=How much fruit do fruit-eating frogs eat? An investigation on the diet of ''Xenohyla truncata'' (Lissamphibia: Anura: Hylidae) |journal=Journal of Zoology |volume=270 |issue=4 |pages=692–698 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.2006.00192.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mexican burrowing toad]] (''Rhinophrynus dorsalis'') has a specially adapted tongue for picking up ants and termites. It projects it with the tip foremost whereas other frogs flick out the rear part first, their tongues being hinged at the front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Trueb, Linda; Gans, Carl |year=1983 |title=Feeding specializations of the Mexican burrowing toad, ''Rhinophrynus dorsalis'' (Anura: Rhinophrynidae) |journal=Journal of Zoology |volume=199 |issue=2 |pages=189–208 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1983.tb02090.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Food is mostly selected by sight, even in conditions of dim light. Movement of the prey triggers a feeding response. Frogs have been caught on fish hooks baited with red flannel and [[Rana clamitans|green frogs]] (''Rana clamitans'') have been found with stomachs full of elm seeds that they had seen floating past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hamilton, W. J. Jr. |year=1948 |title=The food and feeding behavior of the green frog, ''Rana clamitans'' Latreille, in New York State |journal=Copeia |volume=1948 |issue=3 |pages=203–207 |publisher=American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists |jstor=1438455 |doi=10.2307/1438455 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Toads, salamanders and caecilians also use smell to detect prey. This response is mostly secondary because salamanders have been observed to remain stationary near odoriferous prey but only feed if it moves. Cave-dwelling amphibians normally hunt by smell. Some salamanders seem to have learned to recognize immobile prey when it has no smell, even in complete darkness.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | p=56 }}

Amphibians usually swallow food whole but may chew it lightly first to subdue it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins&quot; /&gt; They typically have small hinged [[pedicellate teeth]], a feature unique to amphibians. The base and crown of these are composed of [[dentine]] separated by an [[Calcification|uncalcified]] layer and they are replaced at intervals. Salamanders, caecilians and some frogs have one or two rows of teeth in both jaws but some frogs (''Rana spp.'') lack teeth in the lower jaw, and toads (''Bufo spp.'') have no teeth. In many amphibians there are also [[vomerine teeth]] attached to a facial bone in the roof of the mouth.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=57&amp;ndash;58 }}

The [[Tiger Salamander|tiger salamander]] (''Ambystoma tigrinum'') is typical of the frogs and salamanders that hide under cover ready to ambush unwary invertebrates. Others amphibians, such as the ''Bufo spp.'' toads, actively search for prey, while the [[Argentine horned frog]] (''Ceratophrys ornata'') lures inquisitive prey closer by raising its hind feet over its back and vibrating its yellow toes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Radcliffe, Charles W.; Chiszar, David; Estep, Karen; Murphy, James B.; Smith, Hobart M. |year=1986 |title=Observations on pedal luring and pedal movements in Leptodactylid frogs |journal=Journal of Herpetology |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=300–306 |jstor=1564496 |doi=10.2307/1564496 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among leaf litter frogs in Panama, frogs that actively hunt prey have narrow mouths and are slim, often brightly coloured and toxic, while ambushers have wide mouths and are broad and well-camouflaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Toft, Catherine A. |year=1981 |title=Feeding ecology of Panamanian litter anurans: patterns in diet and foraging mode |journal=Journal of Herpetology |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=139–144 |jstor=1563372 |doi=10.2307/1563372 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Caecilians do not flick their tongues, but catch their prey by grabbing it with their slightly backward-pointing teeth. The struggles of the prey and further jaw movements work it inwards and the caecilian usually retreats into its burrow. The subdued prey is gulped down whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bemis, W. E.; Schwenk, K.; Wake, M.

When they are newly hatched, frog larvae feed on the yolk of the egg. When this is exhausted some move on to feed on bacteria, algal crusts, detritus and raspings from submerged plants. Water is drawn in through their mouths, which are usually at the bottom of their heads, and passes through branchial food traps between their mouths and their gills where fine particles are trapped in mucus and filtered out. Others have specialised mouthparts consisting of a horny beak edged by several rows of labial teeth. They scrape and bite food of many kinds as well as stirring up the bottom sediment, filtering out larger particles with the papillae around their mouths. Some, such as the spadefoot toads, have strong biting jaws and are carnivorous or even cannibalistic.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=181&amp;ndash;185 }}

== Vocalization ==
[[File:Dendropsophus microcephalus - calling male (Cope, 1886).jpg|thumb|alt=Male treefrog calling|Male treefrog (''[[Dendropsophus microcephalus]]'') inflating his air sac as he calls]]
The calls made by caecilians and salamanders are limited to occasional soft squeaks, grunts or hisses and have not been much studied. A clicking sound sometimes produced by caecilians may be a means of orientation, as in bats, or a form of communication. Most salamanders are considered voiceless but the [[California Giant Salamander|California giant salamander]] (''Dicamptodon ensatus'') has vocal cords and can produce a rattling or barking sound. Some species of salamander emit a quiet squeak or yelp if attacked.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=76&amp;ndash;77 }}

[[File:American Toad singing.jpg|thumb|American Toad, (''[[Anaxyrus americanus]]'') singing]]
Frogs are much more vocal, especially during the breeding season when they use their voices to attract mates. The presence of a particular species in an area may be more easily discerned by its characteristic call than by a fleeting glimpse of the animal itself. In most species, the sound is produced by expelling air from the lungs over the vocal cords into an [[Gular skin|air sac]] or sacs in the throat or at the corner of the mouth. This may distend like a balloon and acts as a resonator, helping to transfer the sound to the atmosphere, or the water at times when the animal is submerged.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | p=76&amp;ndash;77 }} The main vocalisation is the male's loud advertisement call which seeks to both encourage a female to approach and discourage other males from intruding on its territory. This call is modified to a quieter courtship call on the approach of a female or to a more aggressive version if a male intruder draws near. Calling carries the risk of attracting predators and involves the expenditure of much energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sullivan, Brian K. |year=1992 |title=Sexual selection and calling behavior in the American toad (''Bufo americanus'') |journal=Copeia |volume=1992 |issue=1 |pages=1–7 |jstor=1446530 |doi=10.2307/1446530 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other calls include those given by a female in response to the advertisement call and a release call given by a male or female during unwanted attempts at amplexus. When a frog is attacked, a distress or fright call is emitted, often resembling a scream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |chapter=Capitulo 4 |title=When frogs scream!

== Territorial behaviour ==
Little is known of the territorial behaviour of caecilians, but some frogs and salamanders defend home ranges. These are usually feeding, breeding or sheltering sites. Males normally exhibit such behaviour though in some species, females and even juveniles are also involved. Although in many frog species, females are larger than males, this is not the case in most species where males are actively involved in territorial defence. Some of these have specific adaptations such as enlarged teeth for biting or spines on the chest, arms or thumbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shine, Richard |year=1979 |title=Sexual selection and sexual dimorphism in the Amphibia |journal=Copeia |volume=1979 |issue=2 |pages=297–306 |jstor=1443418 |doi=10.2307/1443418 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Redback salamander.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Red-backed salamander|The red-backed salamander (''[[Plethodon cinereus]]'') defends a territory against intruders.]]
In salamanders, defence of a territory involves adopting an aggressive posture and if necessary attacking the intruder. This may involve snapping, chasing and sometimes biting, occasionally causing the loss of a tail. The behaviour of [[Red Back Salamander|red-backed salamander]]s (''Plethodon cinereus'') has been much studied. 91% of marked individuals that were later recaptured were within a metre (yard) of their original daytime retreat under a log or rock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gergits&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author= Gergits, W. F.; Jaeger, R. G. | year=1990 | title=Site attachment by the red-backed salamander, ''Plethodon cinereus'' | journal=Journal of Herpetology | volume=24 | issue=1 | pages=91–93 | jstor=1564297 | doi=10.2307/1564297 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar proportion, when moved experimentally a distance of {{convert|30|m}}, found their way back to their home base.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gergits&quot;/&gt; The salamanders left odour marks around their territories which averaged {{convert|0.16|to|0.33|m2}} in size and were sometimes inhabited by a male and female pair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amphibiaweb.org/cgi-bin/amphib_query?query_src=aw_search_index&amp;where-genus=Plethodon&amp;where-species=cinereus&amp;rel-genus=equals&amp;rel-species=equals|title=''Plethodon cinereus'' |author=Casper, Gary S |publisher=AmphibiaWeb |accessdate=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These deterred the intrusion of others and delineated the boundaries between neighbouring areas. Much of their behaviour seemed stereotyped and did not involve any actual contact between individuals. An aggressive posture involved raising the body off the ground and glaring at the opponent who often turned away submissively. If the intruder persisted, a biting lunge was usually launched at either the tail region or the naso-labial grooves. Damage to either of these areas can reduce the fitness of the rival, either because of the need to regenerate tissue or because it impairs its ability to detect food.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gergits&quot; /&gt;

In frogs, male territorial behaviour is often observed at breeding locations; calling is both an announcement of ownership of part of this resource and an advertisement call to potential mates. In general, a deeper voice represents a heavier and more powerful individual, and this may be sufficient to prevent intrusion by smaller males. Much energy is used in the vocalization and it takes a toll on the territory holder who may be displaced by a fitter rival if he tires. There is a tendency for males to tolerate the holders of neighbouring territories while vigorously attacking unknown intruders. Holders of territories have a &quot;home advantage&quot; and usually come off better in an encounter between two similar-sized frogs. If threats are insufficient, chest to chest tussles may take place. Fighting methods include pushing and shoving, deflating the opponent's vocal sac, seizing him by the head, jumping on his back, biting, chasing, splashing, and ducking him under the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Wells, K. D. | year=1977 | title=Territoriality and male mating success in the green frog (''Rana clamitans'') | journal=Ecology | volume=58 | issue=4 | pages=750–762 | jstor=1936211 | doi=10.2307/1936211 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Defence mechanisms ==
[[File:Adult Cane toad.jpg|thumb|alt=Cane toad|[[Cane toad]] (''Bufo marinus'') with poison glands behind the eyes]]

Amphibians have soft bodies and thin skins, lack claws, defensive armour or spines and seem relatively helpless. Nevertheless they have evolved various defence mechanisms to keep themselves alive. The first line of defence in salamanders and frogs is the mucous secretion that they produce. This keeps their skin moist and makes them slippery and difficult to grip. The secretion is often sticky and distasteful or toxic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barthalmus&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barthalmus, G. T.; Zielinski W. J. |year=1988 |title=''Xenopus'' skin mucus induces oral dyskinesias that promote escape from snakes |journal=Pharmacology, Biochemistry Behavior |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=957–959 |pmid=3227042 |doi=10.1016/0091-3057(88)90126-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Snakes have been observed yawning and gaping when trying to swallow [[African clawed frog]]s (''Xenopus laevis''), which gives the frogs an opportunity to escape.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barthalmus&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Xenopus&amp;where-species=laevis |title=Xenopus laevis | author = Crayon, John J | publisher=AmphibiaWeb | accessdate=October 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Caecilians have been little studied in this respect but the Cayenne caecilian (''Typhlonectes compressicauda'') produces toxic mucus that has killed predatory fish in a feeding experiment in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moodie, G.

The [[rough-skinned newt]] (''Taricha granulosa'') from North America and other members of its genus contain the neurotoxin [[tetrodotoxin]] (TTX), the most toxic non-protein substance known and almost identical to that produced by [[pufferfish]]. Handling the newts does not cause harm but ingestion of even the most minute amounts of the skin is deadly. In feeding trials, fish, frogs, reptiles, birds and mammals were all found to be susceptible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Brodie, Edmund D. Jr. |year=1968 |title=Investigations on the skin toxin of the adult rough-skinned newt, ''Taricha granulosa'' |journal=Copeia |volume=1968 |issue=2 |pages=307–313 |jstor=1441757 |doi= 10.2307/1441757 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hanifin&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hanifin, Charles T.; Yotsu-Yamashita, Mari; Yasumoto, Takeshi; Brodie, Edmund D.; Brodie, Edmund D.

These regions are presented to the attacking animal and their secretions may be foul-tasting or cause various physical or neurological symptoms. Altogether, over 200 toxins have been isolated from the limited number of amphibian species that have been investigated.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | p=110 }}

[[File:Salamander-olympus.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Fire salamander|The [[fire salamander]] (''Salamandra salamandra''), a toxic species, wears warning colours.]]

Poisonous species often use bright colouring to warn potential predators of their toxicity. These warning colours tend to be red or yellow combined with black, with the [[Fire Salamander|fire salamander]] (''Salamandra salamandra'') being an example. Once a predator has sampled one of these, it is likely to remember the colouration next time it encounters a similar animal. In some species, such as the [[fire-bellied toad]] (''Bombina spp.''), the warning colouration is on the belly and these animals adopt a defensive pose when attacked, exhibiting their bright colours to the predator. The frog ''[[Allobates zaparo]]'' is not poisonous, but [[Batesian mimicry|mimics]] the appearance of other toxic species in its locality, a strategy that may deceive predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Darst, Catherine R.; Cummings, Molly E. |year=2006 |title=Predator learning favours mimicry of a less-toxic model in poison frogs |journal=Nature |volume=440 |pages=208–211 |doi=10.1038/nature04297 |issue=7081 |pmid=16525472 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many amphibians are nocturnal and hide during the day, thereby avoiding diurnal predators that hunt by sight. Other amphibians use [[camouflage]] to avoid being detected. They have various colourings such as mottled browns, greys and olives to blend into the background. Some salamanders adopt defensive poses when faced by a potential predator such as the North American [[Northern Short-tailed Shrew|northern short-tailed shrew]] (''Blarina brevicauda''). Their bodies writhe and they raise and lash their tails which makes it difficult for the predator to avoid contact with their poison-producing granular glands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brodie, Edmund D. Jr.; Nowak, Robert T.; Harvey, William R. |year=1979 |title=Antipredator secretions and behavior of selected salamanders against shrews |journal=Copeia |volume=1979 |issue=2 |pages=270–274 |jstor=1443413 |doi=10.2307/1443413 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few salamanders will autotomise their tails when attacked, sacrificing this part of their anatomy to enable them to escape. The tail may have a constriction at its base to allow it to be easily detached. The tail is regenerated later but the energy cost to the animal of replacing it is significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Beneski, John T.

Some frogs and toads inflate themselves to make themselves look large and fierce, and some spadefoot toads (''[[Pelobates]] spp'') scream and leap towards the attacker.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins&quot; /&gt; Giant salamanders of the genus ''[[Andrias]]'', as well as [[Ceratophryinae|Ceratophrine]] and ''[[Pyxicephalus]]'' frogs possess sharp teeth and are capable of drawing blood with a defensive bite.

{{main|Decline in amphibian populations}}

[[File:Bufo periglenes1.jpg|thumb|alt=Golden toad|The extinct [[golden toad]] (''Bufo periglenes''), last seen in 1989]]
Dramatic declines in amphibian populations, including population crashes and mass localized [[extinction]], have been noted since the late 1980s from locations all over the world, and amphibian declines are thus perceived to be one of the most critical threats to global [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McCallum |first1= M.

In 2006 there were believed to be 4,035 species of amphibians that depended on water at some stage during their life cycle. Of these, 1,356 (33.6%) were considered to be threatened and this figure is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes 1,427 species for which there was insufficient data to assess their status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://app.databasin.org/app/pages/datasetPage.jsp?id=461e58214aa54ad79382066ab829c05f |title=Number of Globally Threatened Amphibian Species by Freshwater Ecoregion |author=Hoekstra, J.

The [[Western Terrestrial Garter Snake|western terrestrial garter snake]] (''Thamnophis elegans'') in California is largely aquatic and depends heavily on two species of frog that are diminishing in numbers, the [[Yosemite toad]] (''Bufo canorus'') and the [[mountain yellow-legged frog]] (''Rana muscosa''), putting the snake's future at risk.

These normally play an important role in controlling the growth of algae and also forage on [[detritus]] that accumulates as sediment on the bottom. A reduction in the number of tadpoles may lead to an overgrowth of algae, resulting in depletion of oxygen in the water when the algae later die and decompose. Aquatic invertebrates and fish might then die and there would be unpredictable ecological consequences.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | p=249 }}

A [[global strategy]] to stem the crisis was released in 2005 in the form of the Amphibian Conservation Action Plan. Developed by over eighty leading experts in the field, this call to action details what would be required to curtail amphibian declines and extinctions over the following five years and how much this would cost. The Amphibian Specialist Group of the World Conservation Union ([[IUCN]]) is spearheading efforts to implement a comprehensive global strategy for amphibian conservation.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmphibianArk&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iucn.org/about/union/secretariat/offices/asia/regional_activities/asian_amphibian_crisis/taking_action/amphibian_conservation_action_plan/ |title=Amphibian Conservation Action Plan |work=IUCN |accessdate=March 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amphibian Ark]] is an organization that was formed to implement the ex-situ conservation recommendations of this plan, and they have been working with zoos and aquaria around the world, encouraging them to create assurance colonies of threatened amphibians.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmphibianArk&quot; /&gt; One such project is the Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project that built on existing conservation efforts in Panama to create a country-wide response to the threat of chytridiomycosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amphibianrescue.org/?page_id=91 |title=Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project |publisher=Amphibian Ark |accessdate=March 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Study==
The study of amphibians is called batrachology while the study of both reptiles and amphibians is called herpetology. These are part of the broader discipline of [[zoology]] but are seldom studied alone. Research in these fields may explore the animals' taxonomy, morphology, behaviour, ecology, physiology or biochemistry. The results of the research are peer-reviewed and published in scientific journals. Career opportunities include field research, university teaching and research, curating, museum research or management, zoo keeping, breeding or selling animals and wildlife management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asih.org/herpjobs |title=Careers in Herpetology |publisher=American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists |accessdate=December 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alaska''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Alaska.ogg|ə|ˈ|l|æ|s|k|ə}}) is a [[U.S. state]] situated in the northwest extremity of the [[North America|North American continent]]. Bordering the state to the east is the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Yukon| Yukon Territory]] and the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] of [[British Columbia]], the [[Arctic Ocean]] to the north, and the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the west and south, with [[Russia]] (specifically, [[Siberia]]) further west across the [[Bering Strait]]. Alaska is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|largest state]] in the [[United States]] by area, the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|4th least populous]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population density|least densely populated]] of the [[List of U.S. states|50 United States]].  Approximately half of Alaska's 731,449&lt;ref name=PopEstUS/&gt; residents live within the [[Anchorage metropolitan area]]. Alaska's economy is dominated by the [[petroleum|oil]], [[natural gas]], and [[fishing]] industries, resources which it has in abundance. [[Tourism]] is also a significant part of the economy.

Although it had been occupied for thousands of years by indigenous peoples, from the 18th century onward, European powers considered the territory of Alaska ripe for exploitation. The United States [[Alaska Purchase|purchased Alaska]] from [[Russia]] on March 30, 1867, for $7.2&amp;nbsp;million (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|7200000|1867|r=2}}}} adjusted for inflation) at approximately two cents per acre ($4.74/km²). The area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as a [[Territories of the United States|territory]] on May 11, 1912. It was admitted as the 49th state of the U.S. on January 3, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media

The name &quot;Alaska&quot; (Аляска) had been introduced in the [[Russian America|Russian colonial period]], when it was used to refer to the [[Alaska Peninsula|peninsula]]. It was derived from an [[Aleut language|Aleut]] [[idiom]], which [[Literal and figurative language|figuratively]] refers to the mainland of Alaska.  [[Literal translation|Literally]], it means ''object to which the action of the sea is directed''.&lt;ref name=Aleut&gt;{{cite book|title=Aleut Dictionary: Unangam Tunudgusii|author=Bergsland, Knut (ed.)|publisher=Alaska Native Language Center|year=1994|isbn=1-55500-047-9}}, at pp. 49 (Alaxsxi-x = mainland Alaska), 50 (''alagu-x'' = ''sea''), 508 (''-gi'' = suffix, ''object of its action'').&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bright&gt;{{cite book|title=Native American Placenames in the United States|author=Bright, William|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0806135984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ransom, J. Ellis. 1940. &quot;Derivation of the Word &quot;Alaska&quot;, &quot; ''American Anthropologist'' n.s., 42: pp. 550–551&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as ''[[Alyeska]],'' the &quot;great land&quot;, an Aleut word derived from the same root.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Alaska}}
Alaska has a longer coastline than all the other U.S. states combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF14/1404.html |title=Alaska's Size in Perspective |accessdate=November 19, 2007 |author=Benson, Carl|date=September 2, 1998 |publisher=[[Geophysical Institute]], [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]]| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20071125211706/http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF14/1404.html| archivedate=November 25, 2007| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only non-[[contiguous]] U.S. state on continental North America; about {{convert|500|mi|km|-1}} of [[British Columbia]] (Canada) separates Alaska from [[Washington (state)|Washington state]]. Alaska is thus an [[exclave]] of the United States, possibly the largest exclave in the world. It is technically part of the [[Continental United States|continental U.S.]], but is often not included in colloquial use; Alaska is not part of the contiguous U.S., often called [[Outside (Alaska)|&quot;the Lower 48&quot;]].&lt;ref&gt;The other three exclaves of the United States are the [[Northwest Angle]] of [[Minnesota]], [[Point Roberts, Washington]] and [[Alburgh, Vermont]].&lt;/ref&gt; The capital city, [[Juneau]], is situated on the mainland of the North American continent, but is not connected by road to the rest of the North American highway system.

The state is bordered by [[Yukon]] and [[British Columbia]] in Canada, to the east, the [[Gulf of Alaska]] and the Pacific Ocean to the south, the [[Bering Sea]], [[Bering Strait]], and [[Chukchi Sea]] to the west and the Arctic Ocean to the north. Alaska's territorial waters touch Russia's territorial waters in the Bering Strait, as the Russian [[Big Diomede Island]] and Alaskan [[Little Diomede Island]] are only {{convert|3|mi|km}} apart. With the extension of the [[Aleutian Islands]] into the eastern hemisphere, it is technically both the westernmost and easternmost state in the United States, as well as also being the northernmost.

[[File:Alaska area compared to conterminous US.svg|thumb|Alaska's size compared with the [[contiguous United States|48 contiguous states]].]]
Alaska is the largest state in the United States in land area at {{convert|586412|sqmi|km2|0}}, over twice the size of Texas, the next largest state. Alaska is larger than all but 18 sovereign countries. Counting territorial waters, Alaska is larger than the combined area of the next three largest states: Texas, California, and [[Montana]]. It is also larger than the combined area of the 22 smallest U.S. states.

===Regions===
There are no officially defined borders demarcating the various regions of Alaska, but there are six widely accepted regions:

====South Central====
{{main|South Central Alaska}}
The most populous region of Alaska, containing [[Anchorage]], the [[Matanuska-Susitna Valley]] and the [[Kenai Peninsula]].  Rural, mostly unpopulated areas south of the [[Alaska Range]] and west of the [[Wrangell Mountains]] also fall within the definition of Southcentral, as well as the [[Prince William Sound]] area and the communities of [[Cordova, Alaska|Cordova]] and [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]].

====Southeast====
{{main|Southeast Alaska}}
Also referred to as the Panhandle or Inside Passage, this is the region of Alaska closest to the rest of the United States.  As such, this was where most of the initial non-indigenous settlement occurred in the years following the [[Alaska Purchase]].  The region is dominated by the [[Alexander Archipelago]] as well as the [[Tongass National Forest]], the largest national forest in the United States.  It contains the state capital [[Juneau]], the former capital [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], and [[Ketchikan]], at one time Alaska's largest city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sitnews.us/Kiffer/Ketchikan/043007_ketchikan_1927.html |title= 1927: When Ketchikan was the Largest City in Alaska |work=Sitnews US |date=April 30, 2007 |accessdate=July 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Alaska Marine Highway]] provides a vital surface transportation link throughout the area, as only three communities ([[Haines, Alaska|Haines]], [[Hyder, Alaska|Hyder]] and [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]]) enjoy direct connections to the contiguous North American road system.

====Interior====
{{main|Alaska Interior}}
[[File:Denali Mt McKinley.jpg|thumb|[[Mount McKinley]] (Denali) is the highest peak in both Alaska and in all of North America.]]
The largest region of Alaska, much of the interior is uninhabited wilderness.  [[Fairbanks]] is the only large city in the region.  Small towns and Alaska Native villages are scattered throughout, mostly along the highway and river systems.  [[Denali National Park and Preserve]] is located here, home to [[Mount McKinley]] (also widely known by its local name of ''Denali''), the highest point in North America.

====Southwest====
{{main|Southwest Alaska}}
[[File:Grizzly Bear Fishing Brooks Falls.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Grizzly bear]] fishing for [[salmon]] at Brooks Falls, part of [[Katmai National Park and Preserve]].]]
Southwest Alaska is a sparsely inhabited region stretching some {{convert|500|mi|km}} inland from the Bering Sea. Most of the population lives along the coast. [[Kodiak Island]] is also located in Southwest. The massive [[Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta]], one of the largest river deltas in the world, is here.  Portions of the [[Alaska Peninsula]] are considered part of Southwest, with the remaining portions included with the Aleutian Islands (see below).

====North Slope====
{{main|Alaska North Slope}}
The North Slope is mostly [[tundra]] peppered with small villages. The area is known for its massive reserves of crude oil, and contains both the [[National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska]] and the [[Prudhoe Bay Oil Field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alaska.com |url=http://www.alaska.com/regions/ |title=Alaska.com |publisher=Alaska.com |accessdate=June 2, 2010| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20100603064023/http://www.alaska.com/regions/| archivedate=June 3, 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barrow, Alaska|Barrow]], the northernmost city in the United States, is located here. The [[Northwest Arctic Borough, Alaska|Northwest Arctic area]], anchored by [[Kotzebue, Alaska|Kotzebue]] and also containing the [[Kobuk River]] valley, is often regarded as being part of this region.  However, the respective [[Inupiat people|Inupiat]] of the North Slope and of the Northwest Arctic seldom consider themselves to be one people.

====Aleutian Islands====
{{main|Aleutian Islands}}
More than 300 small, volcanic islands make up this chain, which stretches over {{convert|1200|mi}} into the Pacific Ocean. The [[International Date Line]] was drawn west of 180° to keep the whole state, and thus the entire North American continent, within the same legal day.  However, because some of these islands fall in the Eastern Hemisphere, this makes Alaska the northernmost, easternmost and westernmost state in the union, with the southernmost state being Hawaii. Two of the islands, [[Attu Island|Attu]] and [[Kiska]], were occupied by Japanese forces during World War II.

===Natural features===
[[File:Augustine Volcano Jan 12 2006 edited-1.jpg|thumb|[[Augustine Volcano]] erupting on January 12, 2006.]]
With its myriad islands, Alaska has nearly {{convert|34000|mi|km|-1}} of tidal shoreline. The [[Aleutian Islands]] chain extends west from the southern tip of the [[Alaska Peninsula]]. Many active [[volcano]]es are found in the Aleutians and in coastal regions. [[Unimak Island]], for example, is home to [[Mount Shishaldin]], which is an occasionally smoldering volcano that rises to {{convert|10000|ft|m|0}} above the North Pacific. It is the most perfect volcanic cone on Earth, even more symmetrical than Japan's [[Mount Fuji]]. The chain of volcanoes extends to [[Mount Spurr]], west of Anchorage on the mainland. Geologists have identified Alaska as part of [[Wrangellia]], a large region consisting of multiple states and Canadian provinces in the [[Pacific Northwest]], which is actively undergoing [[plate tectonics|continent building]].

One of the world's largest tides occurs in [[Turnagain Arm]], just south of Anchorage&amp;nbsp;– tidal differences can be more than {{convert|35|ft|m|1}}. (Many sources say Turnagain has the second-greatest tides in North America, but several areas in Canada have larger tides.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Porco, Peter|date = June 23, 2003 | title = Long said to be second to Fundy, city tides aren't even close | journal=[[Anchorage Daily News]] | pages = A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|List of lakes in Alaska}}
Alaska has more than three million lakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Alaska Hydrology Survey | publisher=Division of Mining, Land, and Water; [[Alaska Department of Natural Resources]] | url=http://www.dnr.state.ak.us/mlw/water/hydro/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knls.org/English/akfact.htm |title=Alaska Facts |publisher=Knls.org |accessdate=June 2, 2010|archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20080228134807/http%3A//www.knls.org/English/akfact.htm |archivedate =February 28, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marshland]]s and wetland [[permafrost]] cover {{convert|188320|sqmi|km2|0}} (mostly in northern, western and southwest flatlands). Glacier ice covers some {{convert|16000|sqmi|km2|-1}} of land and {{convert|1200|sqmi|km2|-1}} of tidal zone. The [[Bering Glacier]] complex near the southeastern border with Yukon covers {{convert|2250|sqmi|km2|0}} alone. With over 100,000 glaciers, Alaska has half of all in the world.

===Land ownership===
[[File:Public-Lands-Western-US.png|thumb|Alaska has more public land owned by the federal government than any other state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildlandfire.com/docs/2007/western-states-data-public-land.htm |title=Western States Data Public Land Acreage |publisher=Wildlandfire.com |date=November 13, 2007 |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
According to an October 1998 report by the [[United States Bureau of Land Management]], approximately 65% of Alaska is owned and managed by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] as public lands, including a multitude of [[United States National Forest|national forests]], national parks, and [[national wildlife refuge]]s. Of these, the [[Bureau of Land Management]] manages {{convert|87|e6acre|e6ha|abbr=off}}, or 23.8% of the state. The [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] is managed by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]. It is the world's largest wildlife refuge, comprising {{convert|16|e6acre|e6ha|abbr=off}}.

Of the remaining land area, the state of Alaska owns {{convert|101|e6acre|e6ha|abbr=off}};  its entitlement under the [[Alaska Statehood Act]].  A portion of that acreage is occasionally ceded to organized boroughs, under the statutory provisions pertaining to newly formed boroughs.  Smaller portions are set aside for rural subdivisions and other homesteading-related opportunities. These are not very popular due to the often remote and roadless locations.  The [[University of Alaska]], as a [[land grant university]], also owns substantial acreage which it manages independently.

Another {{convert|44|e6acre|e6ha|abbr=off}} are owned by 12 regional, and scores of local, Native corporations created under the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]] (ANCSA) of 1971.  [[Alaska Native Regional Corporation|Regional Native corporation]] [[Doyon, Limited]] often promotes itself as the largest private landowner in Alaska in advertisements and other communications.  Provisions of ANCSA allowing the corporations' land holdings to be sold on the open market starting in 1991 were repealed before they could take effect. Effectively, the corporations hold title (including subsurface title in many cases, a privilege denied to individual Alaskans) but cannot sell the land. [[Alaska Native Allotment Act|Individual Native allotments]] can be and are sold on the open market, however.

Various private interests own the remaining land, totaling about one percent of the state.  Alaska is, by a large margin, the state with the smallest percentage of private land ownership when Native corporation holdings are excluded.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Alaska}}
[[File:Alaska climate regions USGS.gif|thumb|Map depicting the climate zones of Alaska.]]
The climate in Southeast Alaska is a mid-latitude [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Cfb'') in the southern sections and a subarctic oceanic climate (Köppen ''Cfc'') in the northern parts. On an annual basis, Southeast is both the wettest and warmest part of Alaska with milder temperatures in the winter and high precipitation throughout the year. Juneau averages over {{convert|50|in|cm|abbr=on}} of precipitation a year, and Ketchikan averages over {{convert|150|in|cm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Monthly Climate Summary, Ketchikan, Alaska | publisher= Western Regional Climate Center | url = http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?akketc | accessdate = February 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also the only region in Alaska in which the average daytime high temperature is above freezing during the winter months.

The climate of Anchorage and south central Alaska is mild by Alaskan standards due to the region's proximity to the seacoast. While the area gets less rain than southeast Alaska, it gets more snow, and days tend to be clearer. On average, Anchorage receives {{convert|16|in|cm|abbr=on}} of precipitation a year, with around {{convert|75|in|cm|abbr=on}} of snow, although there are areas in the south central which receive far more snow. It is a subarctic climate ([[Köppen climate classification#GROUP D: Continental.2Fmicrothermal climate|Köppen: ''Dfc'']]) due to its brief, cool summers.

The climate of Western Alaska is determined in large part by the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska. It is a subarctic oceanic climate in the southwest and a continental subarctic climate farther north. The temperature is somewhat moderate considering how far north the area is. This region has a tremendous amount of variety in precipitation. An area stretching from the northern side of the Seward Peninsula to the [[Kobuk River]] valley (i.&amp;nbsp;e., the region around [[Kotzebue Sound]]) is technically a desert, with portions receiving less than {{convert|10|in|cm|abbr=on}} of precipitation annually. On the other extreme, some locations between Dillingham and Bethel average around {{convert|100|in|cm|abbr=on}} of precipitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-YK Precip&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Mean Annual Precipitation, Alaska-Yukon|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~mabbott1/climate/mark/Images/AK-PPT-mm.gif|work=Spatial Climate Analysis Service|publisher=Oregon State University|accessdate=June 5, 2012|date=February 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate of the interior of Alaska is subarctic. Some of the highest and lowest temperatures in Alaska occur around the area near Fairbanks. The summers may have temperatures reaching into the 90s °F (the low-to-mid 30s °C), while in the winter, the temperature can fall below {{convert|-60|°F}}. Precipitation is sparse in the Interior, often less than {{convert|10|in|cm|abbr=on}} a year, but what precipitation falls in the winter tends to stay the entire winter.

The highest and lowest recorded temperatures in Alaska are both in the Interior. The highest is {{convert|100|°F}} in [[Fort Yukon, Alaska|Fort Yukon]] (which is just {{convert|8|mi|km|sp=us|disp=or|abbr=on}} inside the arctic circle) on June 27, 1915,&lt;ref name=&quot;NOAA-All Hazards&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards Information&amp;nbsp;— Alaska Weather Interesting Facts and Records | publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] | format = PDF | url = http://www.arh.noaa.gov/docs/AKWXfacts.pdf | accessdate = January 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DRI&gt;{{cite web | title = State Extremes | publisher=Western Regional Climate Center, [[Desert Research Institute]] | url = http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/htmlfiles/state.extremes.html | accessdate = January 3, 2007 | archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20070105015744/http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/htmlfiles/state.extremes.html| archivedate=January 5, 2007| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; making Alaska tied with Hawaii as the state with the lowest high temperature in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = SD Weather History and Trivia for May: May 1 | publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] | url = http://www.crh.noaa.gov/fsd/?n=fsdtrivia05 | accessdate = January 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = FAQ ALASKA&amp;nbsp;— Frequently Asked Questions About Alaska: Weather | publisher=Statewide Library Electronic Doorway, [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] | date= January 17, 2005 | url=http://sled.alaska.edu/akfaq/aksuper.html#wea | accessdate = January 3, 2007 | archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20070102180919/http://sled.alaska.edu/akfaq/aksuper.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; | archivedate=January 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest official Alaska temperature is {{convert|−80|°F}} in [[Prospect Creek, Alaska|Prospect Creek]] on January 23, 1971,&lt;ref name=&quot;NOAA-All Hazards&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=DRI/&gt; one degree above the lowest temperature recorded in continental North America (in [[Snag, Yukon|Snag, Yukon, Canada]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Ned Rozell | title = The Coldest Place in North America | publisher=Geophysical Institute of the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] | date= January 23, 2003 | url = http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF16/1630.html | accessdate = January 3, 2007 | archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20070202040955/http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF16/1630.html| archivedate=February 2, 2007| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate in the extreme north of Alaska is [[polar climate|Arctic]] ([[Köppen climate classification#GROUP E: Polar climates|Köppen: ''ET'']]) with long, very cold winters and short, cool summers. Even in July, the average low temperature in [[Barrow, Alaska|Barrow]] is {{convert|34|°F}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/PABR/2006/7/23/MonthlyHistory.html History for Barrow, Alaska.

===Alaska natives===
{{main|Alaska Natives}}
[[File:AlutiiqDancer.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A modern [[Alutiiq people|Alutiiq]] dancer in traditional festival garb.]]
Numerous indigenous peoples occupied Alaska for thousands of years before the arrival of European peoples to the area. The [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] people developed a society with a [[matrilineal]] kinship system of property inheritance and descent in what is today Southeast Alaska, along with parts of British Columbia and the Yukon. Also in Southeast were the [[Haida people|Haida]], now well known for their unique arts. The [[Tsimshian]] people came to Alaska from British Columbia in 1887, when President [[Grover Cleveland]], and later the U.S. Congress, granted them permission to settle on [[Annette Island]] and found the town of [[Metlakatla, Alaska|Metlakatla]]. All three of these peoples, as well as other [[indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]], experienced [[smallpox]] outbreaks from the late 18th through the mid-19th century, with the most devastating [[epidemics]] occurring in the 1830s and 1860s, resulting in high fatalities and social disruption.&lt;ref&gt;Brian C. Hosmer, ''American Indians in the Marketplace: Persistence and Innovation among the Menominees and Metlakatlans, 1870–1920'' (Lawrence, Kansas: University Press of Kansas, 1999), pp. 129–131, 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aleutian Islands are still home to the [[Aleut people|Aleut]] people's seafaring society, although they were the first Native Alaskans to be exploited by Russians. Western and Southwestern Alaska are home to the [[Yup'ik]], while their cousins the [[Alutiiq people|Alutiiq ~ Sugpiaq]] lived in what is now Southcentral Alaska. The [[Gwich'in people]] of the northern Interior region are [[Alaskan Athabaskans|Athabaskan]] and primarily known today for their dependence on the caribou within the much-contested [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]]. The North Slope and [[Little Diomede Island]] are occupied by the widespread [[Inupiat people]].

===Colonization===
{{see also|Russian America}}
Some researchers believe that the first Russian settlement in Alaska was established in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Свердлов Л. М. Русское поселение на Аляске в XVII в.? «Природа». М., 1992. № 4. С.67–69.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this hypothesis, in 1648 several [[Koch (boat)|koch]]es of [[Semyon Dezhnyov]]'s expedition came ashore in Alaska by storm and founded this settlement. This hypothesis is based on the testimony of [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]] geographer [[Nikolai Daurkin]], who had visited Alaska in 1764–1765 and who had reported on a village on the [[Kheuveren]] River, populated by &quot;bearded men&quot; who &quot;pray to the [[icons]]&quot;. Some modern researchers associate Kheuveren with [[Koyuk River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/4877141/ALEXEI-V-POSTNIKOV-nautical-charts-compiled-by-these-promyshlenniki|title=Outline of the History of Russian Cartography|work=Regions: a Prism to View the Slavic Eurasian World|year=2000|first=Alexey V. |last=Postnikov|authorlink=Alexey Postnikov|accessdate=June 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Russian Sloop-of-War Neva.jpg|thumb|The Russian settlement of St. Paul's Harbor (present-day [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak town]]), [[Kodiak Island]], 1814.]]
The first European vessel to reach Alaska is generally held to be the ''St. Gabriel'' under the authority of the surveyor [[Mikhail Gvozdev|M. S. Gvozdev]] and assistant navigator [[Ivan Fyodorov (navigator)|I. Fyodorov]] on August 21, 1732 during an expedition of Siberian cossak [[Afanasiy Shestakov|A. F. Shestakov]] and Belorussian explorer [[Dmitry Pavlutsky]] (1729—1735)&lt;ref&gt;Аронов В. Н. Патриарх Камчатского мореходства. // «Вопросы истории рыбной промышленности Камчатки»: Историко-краеведческий сб.&amp;nbsp;– Вып. 3.&amp;nbsp;– 2000. Вахрин С. Покорители великого океана. Петроп.-Камч.: Камштат, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another European contact with Alaska occurred in 1741, when [[Vitus Bering]] led an [[second Kamchatka expedition|expedition]] for the Russian Navy aboard the ''St. Peter''. After his crew returned to Russia with [[sea otter]] pelts judged to be the finest fur in the world, small associations of fur traders began to sail from the shores of Siberia toward the Aleutian Islands. The first permanent European settlement was founded in 1784.

Between 1774 and 1800, [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|Spain]] sent several [[Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest|expeditions to Alaska]] in order to assert its claim over the Pacific Northwest. In 1789 a Spanish settlement and [[Fort San Miguel|fort]] were built in [[Nootka Sound]]. These expeditions gave names to places such as [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]], [[Bucareli Sound]], and [[Cordova, Alaska|Cordova]]. Later, the [[Russian-American Company]] carried out an expanded colonization program during the early-to-mid-19th century.

[[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], renamed [[New Archangel]] from 1804 to 1867, on [[Baranof Island]] in the [[Alexander Archipelago]] in what is now [[Southeast Alaska]], became the capital of [[Russian America]]. It remained the capital after the colony was transferred to the United States. The Russians never fully colonized Alaska, and the colony was never very profitable. Evidence of Russian settlement in names and churches survive throughout southeast Alaska.

[[William H. Seward]], the [[United States Secretary of State]], negotiated the [[Alaska Purchase]] (also known as Seward's Folly) with the Russians in 1867 for $7.2&amp;nbsp;million. Alaska was loosely governed by the military initially, and was administered as a [[District of Alaska|district]] starting in 1884, with a governor appointed by the [[President of the United States]]. A federal [[United States territorial court|district court]] was headquartered in Sitka.
[[File:Miners climb Chilkoot.jpg|thumb|Miners and prospectors climb the [[Chilkoot Trail]] during the 1898 [[Klondike Gold Rush]].]]
For most of Alaska's first decade under the United States flag, Sitka was the only community inhabited by American settlers. They organized a &quot;provisional city government,&quot; which was Alaska's first municipal government, but not in a legal sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wheeler|first=Keith|chapter=Learning to cope with 'Seward's Icebox'|title=The Alaskans|year=1977|publisher=[[Time–Life Books]]|location=[[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]]|isbn=0-8094-1506-2|pages=57–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Legislation allowing Alaskan communities to legally incorporate as cities did not come about until 1900, and [[Home rule#Home rule in the United States|home rule]] for cities was extremely limited or unavailable until statehood took effect in 1959.

===U.S. Territory===
Starting in the 1890s and stretching in some places to the early 1910s, [[Alaska Gold Rush|gold rushes]] in Alaska and the nearby [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]] brought thousands of miners and settlers to Alaska.  Alaska was officially incorporated as an organized territory in 1912.  Alaska's capital, which had been in [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] until 1906, was moved north to [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]]. Construction of the [[Alaska Governor's Mansion]] that same year. European immigrants from Norway and Sweden also settled in southeast Alaska, where they entered the fishing and logging industries.

[[File:AttuSnow.jpg|thumb|U.S. troops negotiate snow and ice during the [[Battle of Attu]] in May 1943.]]
During World War II, the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]] focused on the three outer Aleutian Islands&amp;nbsp;– [[Attu Island|Attu]], [[Agattu]] and [[Kiska Island|Kiska]]&lt;ref&gt;these three Aleutian outer islands are about {{convert|460|mi|km}} away from continental USSR, {{convert|920|mi|km}} from continental Alaska (U.S.), {{convert|950|mi|km}} from Japan.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– that were invaded by Japanese troops and occupied between June 1942 and August 1943. [[Unalaska]]/Dutch Harbor became a significant base for the U.S. Army Air Corps and Navy submariners.

The U.S. [[Lend-Lease]] program involved the flying of American warplanes through Canada to Fairbanks and thence Nome; Soviet pilots took possession of these aircraft, ferrying them to fight the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The construction of military bases contributed to the population growth of some Alaskan cities.

===Statehood===
{{see also|Alaska Statehood Act}}
Statehood for Alaska was an important cause of [[James Wickersham]] early in his tenure as a congressional delegate.  Decades later, the statehood movement gained its first real momentum following a territorial referendum in 1946.  The Alaska Statehood Committee and Alaska's Constitutional Convention would soon follow.  Statehood supporters also found themselves fighting major battles against political foes, mostly in the U.S. Congress but also within Alaska.  Statehood was approved by Congress on July 7, 1958. Alaska was officially proclaimed a state on January 3, 1959.

[[File:1964 Alaska Quake Kodiak Before and After.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Kodiak, before and after the [[tsunami]] which followed the [[Good Friday]] earthquake, destroying much of the townsite.]]
In 1960, the Census Bureau reported Alaska's population as 77.2% White, 3% Black, and 18.8% American Indian and Alaska Native.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alaska – Race and Hispanic Origin: 1880 to 1990|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html|accessdate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 27, 1964, the massive &quot;[[Good Friday Earthquake]]&quot; killed 133 people and destroyed several villages and portions of large coastal communities, mainly by the resultant [[tsunamis]] and landslides. It was the [[List of earthquakes#Largest earthquakes by magnitude|third-most-powerful earthquake]] in the recorded history of the world, with a [[moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude]] of 9.2. It was over one thousand times more powerful than the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|1989 San Francisco earthquake]].  The time of day (5:36&amp;nbsp;pm), time of year and location of the epicenter were all cited as factors in potentially sparing thousands of lives, particularly in Anchorage.

The 1968 discovery of oil at [[Prudhoe Bay]] and the 1977 completion of the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline]] led to an oil boom.  Royalty revenues from oil have funded large state budgets from 1980 onward.  That same year, not coincidentally, Alaska repealed its state income tax.

In 1989, the ''[[Exxon Valdez]]'' hit a reef in the [[Prince William Sound]], spilling over {{convert|11|MUSgal|Ml|lk=out|abbr=off|sp=us}} of crude oil over {{convert|1,100|mi}} of coastline. Today, the battle between philosophies of development and conservation is seen in the contentious debate over oil drilling in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] and the proposed [[Pebble Mine]].

===Alaska Heritage Resources Survey===
The Alaska Heritage Resources Survey (AHRS) is a restricted [[inventory]] of all reported [[historic site|historic]] and [[prehistoric]] sites within the state of Alaska and is maintained by the Office of History and Archaeology. The survey's inventory of cultural resources includes objects, structures, buildings, sites, districts, and travel ways, with a general provision that they are over 50 years old. As of January 31, 2012 over 35,000 sites have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dnr.alaska.gov/parks/oha/ahrs/ahrsgeneraloverview.html Alaska Heritage Resources Survey – General Overview], Department of Natural Resources – Alaska.gov (retrieved February 22, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race and ancestry===
According to the [[2010 United States Census]], Alaska had a population of 710,231. In terms of race and ethnicity, the state was 66.7% [[White American|White]] (64.1% Non-Hispanic [[Non-Hispanic Whites|White]]), 14.8% [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] and Alaska Native, 5.4% [[Asian American|Asian]], 3.3% [[African American|Black]] or African American, 1.0% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 1.6% from Some Other Race, and 7.3% from Two or More Races.

===Languages===
According to the 2005–2007 American Community Survey, 84.7% of people over the age of five speak only English at home. About 3.5% speak Spanish at home. About 2.2% speak another [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] at home and about 4.3% speak an [[Languages of Asia|Asian language]] at home.

A total of 5.2% of Alaskans speak one of the state's 22 [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous languages]], known locally as &quot;native languages&quot;. These languages belong to two major language families: [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo–Aleut]] and [[Na-Dene languages|Na-Dene]]. As the homeland of these two major language families of North America, Alaska has been described as the crossroads of the continent. Linguistic and DNA studies done here have provided evidence for the settlement of North America by way of the [[Bering land bridge]].

According to statistics collected by the Association of Religion Data Archives from 2010, about 34% of Alaska residents were members of religious congregations. 100,960 people identified as [[Evangelical Protestant]]s, 50,866 as Roman Catholic, and 32,550 as mainline Protestants.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.thearda.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/s/02/rcms2010_02_state_adh_2010.asp |title=The Association of Religion Data Archives &amp;#124; State Membership Report |publisher=www.thearda.com |accessdate=November 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly 4% are Mormon, 0.5% are Jewish, 1% are Muslim, 0.5% are Buddhist, and 0.5% are Hindu.&lt;ref&gt;http://religions.pewforum.org/maps&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1795, the First [[Russian Orthodox Church]] was established in [[Kodiak Island Borough, Alaska|Kodiak]]. Intermarriage with Alaskan Natives helped the Russian immigrants integrate into society. As a result, an increasing number of Russian Orthodox churches&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vilda.alaska.edu/u?/cdmg11,4904 |title=An early Russian Orthodox Church |publisher=Vilda.alaska.edu |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; gradually became established within Alaska.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Alaska}}
{{See also|Alaska locations by per capita income}}
[[File:Prudhoe Bay aerial FWS.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of infrastructure at the [[Prudhoe Bay Oil Field]].]]
The 2007 [[gross state product]] was $44.9&amp;nbsp;billion, 45th in the nation. Its [[List of U.S. states by GDP per capita (nominal)|per capita personal income]] for 2007 was $40,042, ranking 15th in the nation. According to a 2013 study by Phoenix Marketing International, Alaska had the fifth-largest number of millionaires per capita in the United States, with a ratio of 6.75 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frank|first=Robert|title=Top states for millionaires per capita|url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/101338309|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oil and gas industry dominates the Alaskan economy, with more than 80% of the state's revenues derived from petroleum extraction. Alaska's main export product (excluding oil and natural gas) is seafood, primarily salmon, cod, Pollock and crab.

Agriculture represents a very small fraction of the Alaskan economy. Agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock, dairy products, vegetables, and livestock. Manufacturing is limited, with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere.

Employment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction, shipping, and transportation. Military bases are a significant component of the economy in both Fairbanks and Anchorage. Federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy, allowing the state to keep taxes low. Its industrial outputs are crude petroleum, natural gas, coal, gold, precious metals, zinc and other mining, seafood processing, timber and wood products. There is also a growing service and tourism sector. Tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging.

===Energy===
{{See also|Natural gas in Alaska|Energy law#Alaska law}}
[[File:Alaska Pipeline Closeup Underneath.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline]] transports oil, Alaska's most financially important export, from the [[Alaska North Slope|North Slope]] to [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]]. Pertinent are the [[heat pipe]]s in the column mounts, which disperse heat upwards and prevent melting of [[permafrost]].]]
Alaska has vast energy resources. Major oil and gas reserves are found in the [[Alaska North Slope]] (ANS) and Cook Inlet basins. According to the [[Energy Information Administration]], Alaska ranks second in the nation in crude oil production. Prudhoe Bay on Alaska's North Slope is the highest-yielding oil field in the United States and on North America, typically producing about {{convert|400000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}.

The [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline]] can transport and pump up to {{convert|2.1|Moilbbl|m3}} of crude oil per day, more than any other crude oil pipeline in the United States. Additionally, substantial coal deposits are found in Alaska's bituminous, sub-bituminous, and lignite coal basins.  The [[United States Geological Survey]] estimates that there are {{convert|85.4|Tcuft|km3}} of undiscovered, technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the Alaskan North Slope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgs.gov/corecast/details.asp?ep=74 |title=Gas Hydrates on Alaska's North Slope |publisher=Usgs.gov |accessdate=June 2, 2010| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20100601170523/http://www.usgs.gov/corecast/details.asp?ep=74| archivedate=June 1, 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alaska also offers some of the highest hydroelectric power potential in the country from its numerous rivers. Large swaths of the Alaskan coastline offer wind and geothermal energy potential as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/state/state_energy_profiles.cfm?sid=AK |title=EIA State Energy Profiles: Alaska |publisher=Tonto.eia.doe.gov |date=August 27, 2009 |accessdate=November 7, 2010| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20101103203218/http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/state/state_energy_profiles.cfm?sid=AK| archivedate=November 3, 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alaska's economy depends heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating, transportation, electric power and light. Though wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped, proposals for state-wide energy systems (e.g. with special [[single-wire earth return#Use in interties|low-cost electric interties]]) were judged uneconomical (at the time of the report, 2001) due to low (less than 50¢/gal) fuel prices, long distances and low population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080216014031/http://www.dced.state.ak.us/dca/AEIS/PDF_Files/AIDEA_Energy_Screening.pdf |archivedate=February 16, 2008 |url=http://www.dced.state.ak.us/dca/AEIS/PDF_Files/AIDEA_Energy_Screening.pdf |title=Screening Report for Alaska Rural Energy Plan |date=April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of a gallon of gas in urban Alaska today is usually 30–60¢ higher than the national average; prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on transportation costs, seasonal usage peaks, nearby petroleum development infrastructure and many other factors.

{{double image|left|Alaska Crude Oil Reserves.PNG|190|Alaska Crude Oil Production.PNG|240|Alaska oil reserves peaked in 1978 and have declined 60% thereafter.|Alaska oil production peaked in 1988 and has declined 65% since.}}
Alaska accounts for 9.5% of domestically produced United States oil production in February 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rankings: Crude Oil Production, February 2013|url=http://www.eia.gov/state/rankings/?sid=US&amp;CFID=11011948&amp;CFTOKEN=1da5d5e517e7a485-37ABEB4E-25B3-1C83-549C71EE21A56018&amp;jsessionid=84305d8fd0e59a4565705d1e106846494687#/series/46|publisher=United States Energy Information Administration|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Permanent Fund====
The [[Alaska Permanent Fund]] is a constitutionally authorized appropriation of oil revenues, established by voters in 1976 to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil, largely in anticipation of same from the recently constructed [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]].  The fund was originally proposed by Governor [[Keith Harvey Miller|Keith Miller]] on the eve of the 1969 Prudhoe Bay lease sale, out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale (which amounted to $900 million) at once. It was later championed by Governor [[Jay Hammond]] and [[Kenai, Alaska|Kenai]] [[Alaska House of Representatives|state representative]] Hugh Malone.  It has served as an attractive political prospect ever since, diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund.

The [[Alaska Constitution]] was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose.  The Permanent Fund has become the rare exception to this, mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation.  From its initial principal of $734,000, the fund has grown to $40&amp;nbsp;billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apfc.org/ Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation]&lt;/ref&gt;  Most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside Alaska.  This has led to frequent calls by Alaskan politicians for the Fund to make investments within Alaska, though such a stance has never really gained momentum.

Starting in 1982, dividends from the fund's annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible Alaskans, ranging from an initial $1,000 in 1982 (equal to three years' payout, as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over the distribution scheme) to $3,269 in 2008 (which included a one-time $1,200 &quot;Resource Rebate&quot;). Every year, the state legislature takes out 8% from the earnings, puts 3% back into the principal for inflation proofing, and the remaining 5% is distributed to all qualifying Alaskans. To qualify for the Permanent Fund Dividend, one must have lived in the state for a minimum of 12 months, maintain constant residency subject to allowable absences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pfd.state.ak.us/dividendamounts/index.aspx |title=State of Alaska Permanent Fund Division |publisher=Pfd.state.ak.us |accessdate=June 2, 2010| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20100420014117/http://www.pfd.state.ak.us/dividendamounts/index.aspx| archivedate=April 20, 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not be subject to court judgments or criminal convictions which fall under various disqualifying classifications or may subject the payment amount to civil garnishment.

===Cost of living===
The cost of goods in Alaska has long been higher than in the contiguous 48 states. Federal government employees, particularly [[United States Postal Service]] (USPS) workers and active-duty military members, receive a Cost of Living Allowance usually set at 25% of base pay because, while the cost of living has gone down, it is still one of the highest in the country.

The introduction of [[big-box store]]s in Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau also did much to lower prices. [[Wal-Mart]] opened their first Anchorage store in 1993, and debuted in Fairbanks in 2004. The company currently has locations covering most of the population centers of Alaska, including Juneau, Ketchikan and Kodiak.  However, rural Alaska suffers from extremely high prices for food and consumer goods compared to the rest of the country, due to the relatively limited transportation infrastructure. Many rural residents come into these cities and purchase food and goods in bulk from warehouse clubs like [[Costco]] and [[Sam's Club]]. Some have embraced the free shipping offers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freeshipping.org/category/alaska-free-shipping-coupons/ FreeShipping.org] for examples of companies offering free shipping to Alaska&lt;/ref&gt; of some online retailers to purchase items much more cheaply than they could in their own communities, if they are available at all.

===Agriculture and fishing===
{{expand section | more information on fishing|date=February 2013}}
[[File:Pacific Halibut Fileting.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Halibut]] is important to the state's economy as both a commercial and sport-caught fish.]]
Due to the northern climate and short growing season, relatively little farming occurs in Alaska. Most farms are in either the [[Matanuska Valley]], about {{convert|40|mi|km}} northeast of [[Anchorage]], or on the [[Kenai Peninsula]], about {{convert|60|mi|km}} southwest of Anchorage. The short 100-day growing season limits the crops that can be grown, but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons. The primary crops are potatoes, carrots, lettuce, and cabbage.

The Tanana Valley is another notable agricultural locus, especially [[Delta Junction, Alaska|Delta Junction]] area, about {{convert|100|mi|km}} southeast of Fairbanks, with a sizable concentration of farms growing agronomic crops; these farms mostly lie north and east of [[Fort Greely]].  This area was largely set aside and developed under a state program spearheaded by Hammond during his second term as governor. Delta-area crops consist predominately of barley and hay. West of Fairbanks lies another concentration of small farms catering to restaurants, the hotel and tourist industry, and [[community-supported agriculture]].

Alaskan agriculture has experienced a surge in growth of [[market gardener]]s, small farms and [[farmers' market]]s in recent years, with the highest percentage increase (46%) in the nation in growth in farmers' markets in 2011, compared to 17% nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdamediafb?contentid=2011/08/0338.xml&amp;printable=true&amp;contentidonly=true |title=More than 1,000 New Farmers Markets Recorded Across Country as USDA Directory Reveals 17 Percent Growth &amp;#124; USDA Newsroom |publisher=Usda.gov |date= August 5, 2011|accessdate=June 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[peony]] industry has also taken off, as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during a gap in supply elsewhere in the world, thereby filling a niche in the flower market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alaskapeonies.org/ |title=Welcome to The Alaska Peony Growers Association |publisher=Alaskapeonies.org|accessdate=June 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{double image|left|Heavy-lift melon .jpg|190|Monster vegetable display at the Tanana Valley State Fair 2010.jpg|200|Oversized vegetables on display at the [[Alaska State Fair]] (left) and the [[Tanana Valley State Fair]] (right).}}
Alaska, with no counties, lacks county fairs.  However, a small assortment of state and local fairs (with the [[Alaska State Fair]] in [[Palmer, Alaska|Palmer]] the largest), are held mostly in the late summer.  The fairs are mostly located in communities with historic or current agricultural activity, and feature local farmers exhibiting produce in addition to more high-profile commercial activities such as carnival rides, concerts and food.  &quot;Alaska Grown&quot; is used as an agricultural slogan.

Alaska has an abundance of seafood, with the primary fisheries in the Bering Sea and the North Pacific. Seafood is one of the few food items that is often cheaper within the state than outside it.  Many Alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their household diet while fishing for subsistence, as well as sport.  This includes fish taken by hook, net or wheel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=fishingPersonalUse.main |title=Alaska Department of Fish and Game |publisher=Adfg.alaska.gov |accessdate=May 29, 2011| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20110624202032/http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=fishingPersonalUse.main| archivedate=June 24, 2011| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunting for subsistence, primarily [[caribou]], [[moose]], and [[Dall sheep]] is still common in the state, particularly in remote [[The Bush (Alaska)|Bush]] communities. An example of a traditional native food is [[Akutaq]], the Eskimo ice cream, which can consist of reindeer fat, seal oil, dried fish meat and local berries.

Alaska's reindeer herding is concentrated on [[Seward Peninsula]], where wild caribou can be prevented from mingling and migrating with the domesticated reindeer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reindeer.salrm.uaf.edu/about_reindeer/seward_peninsula.php |title=Reindeer Herding |publisher=Reindeer.salrm.uaf.edu |accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most food in Alaska is transported into the state from [[Outside (Alaska)|&quot;Outside&quot;]], and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive. In rural areas, subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive. Though most small towns and villages in Alaska lie along the coastline, the cost of importing food to remote villages can be high, because of the terrain and difficult road conditions, which change dramatically, due to varying climate and precipitation changes. The cost of transport can reach as high as 50¢ per pound ($1.10/kg) or more in some remote areas, during the most difficult times, if these locations can be reached at all during such inclement weather and terrain conditions. The cost of delivering a {{convert|1|USgal|L}} of milk is about $3.50 in many villages where per capita income can be $20,000 or less. Fuel cost per gallon is routinely 20–30¢ higher than the continental United States average, with only Hawaii having higher prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daily Fuel Gauge Report|url=http://fuelgaugereport.aaa.com/?redirectto=http://fuelgaugereport.opisnet.com/index.asp|publisher=Automobile Association of America|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Retail Fuel Pricing and News|url=http://www.opisnet.com/retail-fuel-prices.aspx|publisher=Oil Price Information Service|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alaska has few road connections compared to the rest of the U.S. The state's road system covers a relatively small area of the state, linking the central population centers and the [[Alaska Highway]], the principal route out of the state through Canada. The state capital, Juneau, is not accessible by road, only a car ferry, which has spurred several debates over the decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system, or building a road connection from [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]]. The western part of Alaska has no road system connecting the communities with the rest of Alaska.

One unique feature of the Alaska Highway system is the [[Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel]], an active [[Alaska Railroad]] tunnel recently upgraded to provide a paved roadway link with the isolated community of [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]] on [[Prince William Sound]] to the [[Seward Highway]] about {{convert|50|mi|km}} southeast of Anchorage at [[Portage, Alaska|Portage]]. At {{convert|2.5|mi|km|1}}, the tunnel was the longest road tunnel in North America until 2007.&lt;ref&gt;completion of the {{convert|3.5|mi|km|adj=on|1}} [[Interstate 93]] tunnel as part of the &quot;[[Big Dig]]&quot; project in Boston, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt; The tunnel is the longest combination [[List of road-rail tunnels|road and rail tunnel]] in North America.

===Rail===
[[File:Alaska Railroad.jpg|thumb|An Alaska Railroad locomotive and tanker cars crossing the [[George Parks Highway]] in 1994.]]
[[File:Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area, In to the Tunnel.jpg|thumb|The [[White Pass and Yukon Route]] traverses rugged terrain north of [[Skagway]] near the [[Canada–United States border|Canadian border]].]]
Built around 1915, the [[Alaska Railroad]] (ARR) played a key role in the development of Alaska through the 20th century. It links north Pacific shipping through providing critical infrastructure with tracks that run from [[Seward, Alaska|Seward]] to [[Interior Alaska]] by way of [[South Central Alaska]], passing through Anchorage, [[Eklutna]], Wasilla, [[Talkeetna, Alaska|Talkeetna]], [[Denali]], and Fairbanks, with spurs to [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]], [[Palmer, Alaska|Palmer]] and [[North Pole, Alaska|North Pole]]. The cities, towns, villages, and region served by ARR tracks are known statewide as &quot;The Railbelt&quot;. In recent years, the ever-improving paved highway system began to eclipse the railroad's importance in Alaska's economy.

The railroad played a vital role in Alaska's development, moving freight into Alaska while transporting natural resources southward (i.e., coal from the Usibelli coal mine near [[Healy, Alaska|Healy]] to Seward and gravel from the Matanuska Valley to Anchorage). It is well known for its summertime tour passenger service.

The Alaska Railroad was one of the last railroads in North America to use [[caboose]]s in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains. It continues to offer one of the last [[Request stop|flag stop]] routes in the country. A stretch of about {{convert|60|mi|km|-1}} of track along an area north of Talkeetna remains inaccessible by road; the railroad provides the only transportation to rural homes and cabins in the area. Until construction of the Parks Highway in the 1970s, the railroad provided the only land access to most of the region along its entire route.

In northern Southeast Alaska, the [[White Pass and Yukon Route]] also partly runs through the state from [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]] northwards into Canada (British Columbia and Yukon Territory), crossing the border at [[White Pass]] Summit. This line is now mainly used by tourists, often arriving by cruise liner at Skagway. It was featured in the 1983 [[BBC]] television series ''[[Great Little Railways]].''

The Alaska Rail network is not connected to Outside. In 2000, the U.S. Congress authorized $6&amp;nbsp;million to study the feasibility of a rail link between Alaska, Canada, and the lower 48.&lt;ref name=&quot;RailLink1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url= http://communities.canada.com/vancouversun/blogs/powerplay/archive/2010/12/13/transporting-oil-across-b-c.aspx | title=Alaska Oil / BC Tar sands via rail | author=Barbara Yaffe | date=January 2, 2011 | accessdate=January 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RailLink2&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2138860820070622| title= Economic study touts Alaska-Canada rail link| author=Allan Dowd   | date=June 27, 2007 | accessdate=January 2, 2011 |agency=Reuters  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RailLink3&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://alaskacanadarail.com/index.html| title=Alaska Canada Rail Link | author=AlaskaCanadaRail.org | date=January 2, 2005 | accessdate=January 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alaska Rail Marine]] provides [[car float]] service between [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]] and [[Seattle]].

===Marine transport===
Many cities, towns and villages in the state do not have road or highway access; the only modes of access involve travel by air, river, or the sea.
[[File:Tustumena, Alaska Marine Highway.jpg|thumb|The {{MV|Tustumena}} (named after [[Tustumena Glacier]]) is one of the state's many ferries, providing service between the [[Kenai Peninsula]], [[Kodiak Island]] and the [[Aleutian Chain]].]]
Alaska's well-developed state-owned ferry system (known as the [[Alaska Marine Highway]]) serves the cities of [[Southeast Alaska|southeast]], the Gulf Coast and the Alaska Peninsula. The ferries transport vehicles as well as passengers. The system also operates a ferry service from [[Bellingham, Washington]] and [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia]] in Canada through the [[Inside Passage]] to [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]]. The [[Inter-Island Ferry Authority]] also serves as an important marine link for many communities in the [[Prince of Wales Island (Alaska)|Prince of Wales Island]] region of Southeast and works in concert with the Alaska Marine Highway.

In recent years, cruise lines have created a summertime tourism market, mainly connecting the Pacific Northwest to Southeast Alaska and, to a lesser degree, towns along Alaska's gulf coast. The population of [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]] may rise by over 10,000 people on many days during the summer, as up to four large cruise ships at a time can dock, debarking thousands of passengers.

===Air transport===
Cities not served by road, sea, or river can be reached only by air, foot, dogsled, or snowmachine, accounting for Alaska's extremely well developed [[Alaskan Bush|bush]] air services—an Alaskan novelty. Anchorage and, to a lesser extent Fairbanks, is served by [[Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport#Airlines and destinations|many major airlines]]. Because of limited highway access, air travel remains the most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state. Anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at [[Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport]] to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism (in 2000–2001, the latest year for which data is available, 2.4&amp;nbsp;million total arrivals to Alaska were counted, 1.7&amp;nbsp;million by air travel; 1.4&amp;nbsp;million were visitors).&lt;ref&gt;State of Alaska Office of Economic Development. ''[http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/toubus/pub/AVSPSummerArrival111402.pdf Alaska Visitor Arrivals and Profile-Summer 2001]''. November 2002. Retrieved September 11, 2006. {{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;State of Alaska Office of Economic Development. ''[http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/oed/toubus/pub/AVSPWinterArrival111402.pdf Alaska Visitor Arrivals and Profile-Fall/Winter 2001]''. November 2002. Retrieved September 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regular flights to most villages and towns within the state that are commercially viable are challenging to provide, so they are heavily subsidized by the federal government through the [[Essential Air Service]] program. [[Alaska Airlines]] is the only major airline offering in-state travel with jet service (sometimes in combination cargo and passenger [[Boeing 737]]-400s) from Anchorage and Fairbanks to regional hubs like [[Bethel, Alaska|Bethel]], [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]], [[Kotzebue, Alaska|Kotzebue]], [[Dillingham, Alaska|Dillingham]], [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak]], and other larger communities as well as to major Southeast and Alaska Peninsula communities.

[[File:ERA Aviation prop plane landing at ANC (6194226738).jpg|thumb|A [[Bombardier Dash 8]], operated by [[Era Alaska]], on approach to [[Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport]].]]
The bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines such as [[Era Aviation]], [[PenAir]], and [[Frontier Flying Service]]. The smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the [[Cessna Caravan]], the most popular aircraft in use in the state. Much of this service can be attributed to the Alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to Alaskan rural communities. The program requires 70% of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities.

Many communities have small air taxi services.  These operations originated from the demand for customized transport to remote areas.  Perhaps the most quintessentially Alaskan plane is the bush seaplane. The world's busiest seaplane base is [[Lake Hood Seaplane Base|Lake Hood]], located next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers, cargo, and many items from stores and warehouse clubs. Alaska has the highest number of pilots per capita of any U.S. state: out of the estimated 663,661 residents, 8,550 are pilots, or about one in 78.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Aviation Administration. ''[http://www.faa.gov/data_research/aviation_data_statistics/civil_airmen_statistics/2005/ 2005 U.S. Civil Airman Statistics]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other transport===
Another Alaskan transportation method is the [[dogsled]]. In modern times (that is, any time after the mid-late 1920s), dog [[mushing]] is more of a sport than a true means of transportation. Various races are held around the state, but the best known is the [[Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race]], a {{convert|1150|mi|adj=on}} trail from Anchorage to Nome (although the distance varies from year to year, the official distance is set at {{convert|1049|mi|km|disp=or|abbr=out}}). The race commemorates the famous [[1925 serum run to Nome]] in which mushers and dogs like [[Togo (dog)|Togo]] and [[Balto]] took much-needed medicine to the [[diphtheria]]-stricken community of [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] when all other means of transportation had failed. Mushers from all over the world come to Anchorage each March to compete for cash, prizes, and prestige. The &quot;Serum Run&quot; is another sled dog race that more accurately follows the route of the famous 1925 relay, leaving from the community of [[Nenana, Alaska|Nenana]] (southwest of Fairbanks) to Nome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.serumrun.org/ |title=Norman Vaughan Serum Run |publisher=United Nations  |date=April 15, 2010 |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In areas not served by road or rail, primary transportation in summer is by [[all-terrain vehicle]] and in winter by [[snowmobile]] or &quot;snow machine,&quot; as it is commonly referred to in Alaska.

===Data transport===
Alaska's internet and other data transport systems are provided largely through the two major telecommunications companies: [[GCI (company)|GCI]] and [[Alaska Communications]]. GCI owns and operates what it calls the Alaska United Fiber Optic system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alaskaunited.com/description.htm |title=Alaska United Fiber Optic System homepage |publisher=Alaskaunited.com |accessdate=July 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of late 2011 Alaska Communications advertised that it has &quot;two fiber optic paths to the lower 48 and two more across Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alaskacommunications.com/Personal/Wireless/Coverage-Map.aspx Alaska Communications Coverage Map]. Alaska Communications.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, it was reported that a $1 billion project to run connect Asia and rural Alaska was being planned, aided in part by $350 million in stimulus from the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adn.com/2010/01/13/1091946/arctic-fiber-optic-cable-could.html Arctic fiber-optic cable could benefit far-flung Alaskans]. ''Anchorage Daily News''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law and government==

===State government===
[[File:Juneau, Alaska Downtown.jpg|thumb|The center of state government in [[Juneau]].  The large buildings in the background are, from left to right: the Court Plaza Building (known colloquially as the &quot;[[Spam (food)|Spam Can]]&quot;), the State Office Building (behind), the Alaska Office Building, the [[List of Justices of the Alaska Supreme Court|John H. Dimond]] State Courthouse, and the [[Alaska State Capitol]].  Many of the smaller buildings in the foreground are also occupied by state government agencies.]]
{{Main|Government of Alaska}}

Like all other U.S. states, Alaska is governed as a republic, with three [[separation of powers|branches of government]]: an [[executive branch]] consisting of the [[Governor of Alaska]] and the other independently elected constitutional officers; a [[legislative branch]] consisting of the [[Alaska House of Representatives]] and [[Alaska Senate]]; and a [[judicial branch]] consisting of the [[Alaska Supreme Court]] and lower courts.

The state of Alaska employs approximately 15,000 people statewide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dop.state.ak.us/employeeOrientation/introduction |title=State of Alaska |publisher=Dop.state.ak.us |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Alaska Legislature]] consists of a 40-member [[Alaska House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and a 20-member [[Alaska Senate|Senate]]. Senators serve four-year terms and House members two. The [[Governor of Alaska]] serves four-year terms. The [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Alaska|lieutenant governor]] runs separately from the governor in the [[Primary election|primaries]], but during the general election, the nominee for governor and nominee for lieutenant governor run together on the same ticket.

Alaska's court system has four levels: the [[Alaska Supreme Court]], the [[Alaska Court of Appeals]], the superior courts and the district courts.&lt;ref name=&quot;cts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.ak.us/courts/ctinfo.htm |title=About the Alaska Court System |publisher=State.ak.us |accessdate=June 2, 2010| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20100613094049/http://www.state.ak.us/courts/ctinfo.htm| archivedate=June 13, 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The superior and district courts are [[trial court]]s. Superior courts are courts of general jurisdiction, while district courts only hear certain types of cases, including misdemeanor criminal cases and civil cases valued up to $100,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;cts&quot;/&gt;

The Supreme Court and the Court Of Appeals are [[appellate court]]s. The Court Of Appeals is required to hear appeals from certain lower-court decisions, including those regarding criminal prosecutions, juvenile delinquency, and [[habeas corpus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cts&quot;/&gt; The Supreme Court hears civil appeals and may in its discretion hear criminal appeals.&lt;ref name=&quot;cts&quot;/&gt;

===State politics===
{{main|Politics of Alaska}}
{{Further2|[[Political party strength in Alaska]], [[Alaska political corruption probe]]}}

Although in its early years of statehood Alaska was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] state, since the early 1970s it has been characterized as [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-leaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://election.nationaljournal.com/states/ak.htm |title=National Journal Alaska State Profile |publisher=Election.nationaljournal.com |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local political communities have often worked on issues related to land use development, fishing, tourism, and individual rights. [[Alaska Natives]], while organized in and around their communities, have been active within the [[Alaska Native Regional Corporations|Native corporations]]. These have been given ownership over large tracts of land, which require stewardship.

Alaska was formerly the only state in which possession of one ounce or less of marijuana in one's home was completely legal under state law, though the federal law remains in force.&lt;ref name=seattle_times&gt;{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003118645_webpot10.html |title=Judge rules against Alaska marijuana law |accessdate=May 22, 2008 |last=Volz |first=Matt |date=July 11, 2006 |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |publisher=Frank A. Blethen| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20080617044034/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003118645_webpot10.html| archivedate=June 17, 2008| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state has an independence movement favoring a vote on secession from the United States, with the [[Alaskan Independence Party]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AIPqa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akip.org/faqs.html|title=Questions And Answers&amp;nbsp;— About Alaskan Independence |year=2006|publisher=Alaskan Independence Party}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and four [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] have served as governor of Alaska.  In addition, Republican Governor [[Walter Joseph Hickel|Wally Hickel]] was elected to the office for a second term in 1990 after leaving the Republican party and briefly joining the Alaskan Independence Party ticket just long enough to be reelected. He subsequently officially rejoined the Republican party in 1994.

===Taxes===
To finance state government operations, Alaska depends primarily on petroleum revenues and federal subsidies. This allows it to have the lowest individual tax burden in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;CNN Money (2005). &quot;How tax friendly is your state?&quot; Retrieved from [http://money.cnn.com/pf/features/lists/taxesbystate2005/index.html CNN website].&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of five states with no state [[sales tax]], one of seven states that do not levy an individual [[income tax]], and one of the two states that has neither. The Department of Revenue Tax Division&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tax.state.ak.us/ |title=Department of Revenue Tax Division |publisher=Tax.state.ak.us |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; reports regularly on the state's revenue sources. The Department also issues an annual summary of its operations, including new state laws that directly affect the tax division.

While Alaska has no state sales tax, 89 municipalities collect a local sales tax, from 1.0–7.5%, typically 3–5%. Other local taxes levied include raw fish taxes, hotel, motel, and bed-and-breakfast 'bed' taxes, [[severance tax]]es, liquor and tobacco taxes, gaming (pull tabs) taxes, tire taxes and fuel transfer taxes. A part of the revenue collected from certain state taxes and license fees (such as petroleum, aviation motor fuel, telephone cooperative) is shared with municipalities in Alaska.

[[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]] has one of the highest property taxes in the state as no sales or income taxes are assessed in the [[Fairbanks North Star Borough]] (FNSB). A sales tax for the FNSB has been voted on many times, but has yet to be approved, leading law makers to increase taxes dramatically on goods such as liquor and tobacco.

In 2008 the [[Tax Foundation]] ranked Alaska as having the fourth most &quot;business friendly&quot; tax policy, behind only [[Wyoming]], [[Nevada]], and [[South Dakota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taxfoundation.org/research/topic/11.html |title=Educating Taxpayers Since 1937 |publisher=The Tax Foundation |accessdate=June 2, 2010| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20100712120414/http://www.taxfoundation.org/research/topic/11.html| archivedate=July 12, 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alaska regularly supports [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] in presidential elections and has done so since statehood. Republicans have won the state’s [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral college]] votes in all but one election that it has participated in ([[United States presidential election, 1964|1964]]). No state has voted for a Democratic presidential candidate fewer times. Alaska was carried by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] during his landslide election in [[U.S. presidential election, 1964|1964]], while the [[U.S. presidential election, 1960|1960]] and [[U.S. presidential election, 1968|1968]] elections were close. Since [[U.S. presidential election, 1972|1972]], however, Republicans have carried the state by large margins. In [[U.S. presidential election, 2008|2008]], Republican [[John McCain]] defeated Democrat [[Barack Obama]] in Alaska, 59.49% to 37.83%. McCain's running mate was [[Sarah Palin]], the state's governor and the first Alaskan on a major party ticket. Obama lost Alaska again in [[U.S. presidential election, 2012|2012]], but he captured 40% of the state’s vote in that election, making him the first Democrat to do so since 1968.

The [[The Bush (Alaska)|Alaska Bush]], central Juneau, midtown and downtown Anchorage, and the areas surrounding the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] campus and Ester have been strongholds of the Democratic Party. The Matanuska-Susitna Borough, the majority of Fairbanks (including North Pole and the military base), and South Anchorage typically have the strongest Republican showing. As of 2004, well over half of all registered voters have chosen &quot;Non-Partisan&quot; or &quot;Undeclared&quot; as their affiliation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.state.ak.us/ltgov/elections/regbypty.htm|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080225223222/http://www.gov.state.ak.us/ltgov/elections/regbypty.htm|archivedate=February 25, 2008 |title=State of Alaska |publisher=Gov.state.ak.us |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite recent attempts to close primaries to unaffiliated voters.

Because of its population relative to other U.S. states, Alaska has only one member in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]. This seat is  held by Republican [[Don Young]], who was re-elected to his 21st consecutive term in 2012.  [[Alaska's At-large congressional district]] is one of the largest parliamentary constituencies in the world.

In 2008, Governor [[Sarah Palin]] became the first Republican woman to run on a national ticket when she became [[John McCain]]'s running mate.  She continued to be a prominent national figure even after resigning from the governor's job in July 2009.{{citation needed|date= January 2014}}

[[List of United States Senators from Alaska|Alaska's United States Senators]] belong to [[Classes of United States Senators|Class 2 and Class 3]].  In 2008, Democrat [[Mark Begich]], mayor of Anchorage, defeated long-time Republican senator [[Ted Stevens]]. Stevens had been convicted on seven felony counts of failing to report gifts on Senate financial discloser forms one week before the election. The conviction was set aside in April 2009 after evidence of prosecutorial misconduct emerged.

Republican [[Frank Murkowski]] held the state's other senatorial position. After being elected governor in 2002, he resigned from the Senate and appointed his daughter, State Representative [[Lisa Murkowski]] as his successor. She won full six-year terms in 2004 and 2010.

Alaska is not divided into [[County (United States)|counties]], as most of the other U.S. states, but it is divided into ''[[List of boroughs and census areas in Alaska|boroughs]]''. Many of the more densely populated parts of the state are part of Alaska's 16 boroughs, which function somewhat similarly to counties in other states. However, unlike county-equivalents in the other 49 states, the boroughs do not cover the entire land area of the state. The area not part of any borough is referred to as the [[Unorganized Borough, Alaska|Unorganized Borough]].

The Unorganized Borough has no government of its own, but the [[U.S. Census Bureau]] in cooperation with the state divided the Unorganized Borough into 11 [[census area]]s solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation. A ''recording district'' is a mechanism for administration of the [[public record]] in Alaska. The state is divided into 34 recording districts which are centrally administered under a State [[recorder of deeds|Recorder]]. All recording districts use the same acceptance criteria, fee schedule, etc., for accepting documents into the public record.

Whereas many U.S. states use a three-tiered system of decentralization—state/county/township—most of Alaska uses only two tiers—state/borough. Owing to the low population density, most of the land is located in the [[Unorganized Borough]]. As the name implies, it has no intermediate borough government but is administered directly by the state government. /in 2000, 57.71% of Alaska's area has this status, with 13.05% of the population.

For statistical purposes, the [[United States Census Bureau]] divides this territory into [[census area]]s. Anchorage merged the city government with the Greater Anchorage Area Borough in 1975 to form the Municipality of Anchorage, containing the city proper and the communities of Eagle River, Chugiak, Peters Creek, Girdwood, Bird, and Indian. Fairbanks has a separate borough (the [[Fairbanks North Star Borough]]) and municipality (the City of Fairbanks).

The state's most populous city is [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], home to 278,700 people in 2006, 225,744 of whom live in the urbanized area. The richest [[Alaska locations by per capita income|location in Alaska by per capita income]] is [[Halibut Cove, Alaska|Halibut Cove]] ($89,895). [[Yakutat City]], Sitka, Juneau, and Anchorage are the four [[List of U.S. cities by area|largest cities in the U.S. by area]].

===Cities and census-designated places (by population)===
As reflected in the [[2010 United States Census]], Alaska has a total of 355 incorporated cities and [[census-designated place]]s (CDPs).  The tally of cities includes four unified municipalities, essentially the equivalent of a [[consolidated city–county]].  The majority of these communities are located in the rural expanse of Alaska known as &quot;[[The Bush (Alaska)|The Bush]]&quot; and are unconnected to the contiguous North American road network.  The table at the bottom of this section lists the 100 largest cities and census-designated places in Alaska, in population order.

Of Alaska's 2010 Census population figure of 710,231, 20,429 people, or 2.88% of the population, did not live in an incorporated city or census-designated place.  Approximately three-quarters of that figure were people who live in urban and suburban neighborhoods on the outskirts of the city limits of Ketchikan, Kodiak, Palmer and Wasilla.  CDPs have not been established for these areas by the [[United States Census Bureau]], except that six CDPs were established for the Ketchikan-area neighborhoods in the [[1980 United States Census|1980 Census]] (Clover Pass, Herring Cove, Ketchikan East, Mountain Point, North [[Tongass Highway]], [[Pennock Island]] and [[Saxman, Alaska|Saxman]] East), but have not been used since.  The remaining population was scattered throughout Alaska, both within organized boroughs and in the [[Unorganized Borough]], in largely remote areas.

The [[Alaska Department of Education and Early Development]] administers many [[List of school districts in Alaska|school districts]] in Alaska. In addition, the state operates a boarding school, [[Mt. Edgecumbe High School]] in [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]]; and provides partial funding for other boarding schools, including [[Nenana Student Living Center]] in [[Nenana, Alaska|Nenana]] and The Galena Interior Learning Academy in [[Galena, Alaska|Galena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=//web.archive.org/web/20071009144551/http://www.alaskaice.org/material.php?matID=138|title=Asset Building in Residence Life|publisher=Alaska ICE |date=April 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are more than a dozen [[List of colleges and universities in Alaska|colleges and universities in Alaska]]. Accredited universities in Alaska include the [[University of Alaska Anchorage]], [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]], [[University of Alaska Southeast]], and [[Alaska Pacific University]].&lt;ref&gt;These are the only three universities in the state ranked by [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]. [http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/rankindex_brief.php]&lt;/ref&gt; Alaska is the only state that has no institutions that are part of the [[NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] program.

The Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development operates AVTEC, Alaska's Institute of Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avtec.labor.state.ak.us/ |title=AVTEC – Home Page |publisher=Avtec.labor.state.ak.us|accessdate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Campuses in Seward and Anchorage offer 1 week to 11-month training programs in areas as diverse as Information Technology, Welding, Nursing, and Mechanics.

Alaska has had a problem with a &quot;[[brain drain]]&quot;. Many of its young people, including most of the highest academic achievers, leave the state after high school graduation and do not return. As of 2013, Alaska did not have a [[Legal education in Alaska|law school]] or medical school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publication-date=February 5, 2013 |title=House Bill 43 &quot;University Institutes Of Law And Medicine&quot; |work= States News Service |url= http://akdemocrats.org/?bill=hb43|accessdate=December 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Alaska]] has attempted to combat this by offering partial four-year scholarships to the top 10% of Alaska high school graduates, via the Alaska Scholars Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alaska.edu/scholars/faq.xml#scholars_award |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080309023826/http://www.alaska.edu/scholars/faq.xml |archivedate=March 9, 2008 |title=UA Scholars Program&amp;nbsp;– Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=December 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public health and public safety==
{{See also|Dentistry in rural Alaska}}
The [[Alaska State Troopers]] are Alaska's statewide police force. They have a long and storied history, but were not an official organization until 1941. Before the force was officially organized, law enforcement in Alaska was handled by various federal agencies. Larger towns usually have their own local police and some villages rely on &quot;Public Safety Officers&quot; who have police training but do not carry firearms. In much of the state, the troopers serve as the only police force available. In addition to enforcing traffic and criminal law, wildlife Troopers enforce hunting and fishing regulations. Due to the varied terrain and wide scope of the Troopers' duties, they employ a wide variety of land, air, and water patrol vehicles.

Many rural communities in Alaska are considered &quot;dry,&quot; having outlawed the importation of alcoholic beverages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dps.state.ak.us/abc/restrictions.aspx |title=AK Dept. of Public Safety Alcoholic Beverage Control Board |publisher=Dps.state.ak.us |accessdate=June 2, 2010| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20100528103944/http://www.dps.state.ak.us/abc/restrictions.aspx| archivedate=May 28, 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Suicide rates for rural residents are higher than urban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hss.state.ak.us/suicideprevention/statistics_pages_sspc/AKsuiciderate_rural_urban_90-00.htm |title=State of Alaska |publisher=Hss.state.ak.us |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Iditarod Ceremonial start in Anchorage, Alaska.jpg|thumb|A dog team in the [[Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race]], arguably the most popular winter event in Alaska.]]
Some of Alaska's popular annual events are the [[Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race]] that starts in Anchorage and ends in Nome, World Ice Art Championships in Fairbanks, the Blueberry Festival and Alaska Hummingbird Festival in [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]], the [[Sitka Whale Fest]], and the Stikine River Garnet Fest in [[Wrangell, Alaska|Wrangell]]. The [[Stikine River]] attracts the largest springtime concentration of [[American Bald Eagle]]s in the world.

The [[Alaska Native Heritage Center]] celebrates the rich heritage of Alaska's 11 cultural groups. Their purpose is to encourage cross-cultural exchanges among all people and enhance enhance self-esteem among Native people. The [[Alaska Native Arts Foundation]] promotes and markets Native art from all regions and cultures in the State, using the internet; its gallery in Anchorage, 500 West Sixth Avenue, and at the [http://www.alaskahouseny.org/index.aspx?ModuleID=1 Alaska House New York], 109 Mercer Street in SoHo.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alaskanativearts.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Alaska}}
Influences on music in Alaska include the traditional music of Alaska Natives as well as folk music brought by later immigrants from Russia and Europe. Prominent musicians from Alaska include singer [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]], traditional Aleut flautist [[Mary Youngblood]], folk singer-songwriter [[Libby Roderick]], Christian music singer/songwriter [[Lincoln Brewster]], metal/post hardcore band [[36 Crazyfists]] and the groups [[Pamyua]] and [[Portugal. The Man]].

There are many established music festivals in Alaska, including the [[Alaska Folk Festival]], the [[Fairbanks Summer Arts Festival]], the [http://anchoragefolkfestival.org/ Anchorage Folk Festival], the [[Athabascan Old-Time Fiddling Festival]], the Sitka Jazz Festival, and the [[Sitka Summer Music Festival]]. The most prominent orchestra in Alaska is the [[Anchorage Symphony Orchestra]], though the [[Fairbanks Symphony Orchestra]] and [[Juneau Symphony]] are also notable. The [[Anchorage Opera]] is currently the state's only professional opera company, though there are several volunteer and semi-professional organizations in the state as well.

The official [[List of U.S. state songs|state song]] of Alaska is &quot;[[Alaska's Flag]]&quot;, which was adopted in 1955; it celebrates the [[flag of Alaska]].

===Alaska in film and on television===
{{see also|List of films set in Alaska}}
[[File:Bow bow.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Films featuring Alaskan wolves usually employ domesticated [[wolf-dog hybrid]]s to stand in for wild wolves.]]&lt;!--That's because Hollywood starlets are crunchy and good with ketchup?--&gt;
Alaska's first independent picture all made on location was during the silent years.  ''[[The Chechahcos]]'' was produced by Alaskan businessman [[Austin E. Lathrop]] and filmed in and around Anchorage. Released in 1924 by the Alaska Moving Picture Corporation, it was the only film the company made.

One of the most prominent movies filmed in Alaska is [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]'s ''[[Eskimo/Mala The Magnificent]]'', starring Alaska Native [[Ray Mala]]. In 1932 an expedition set out from [[MGM]]'s studios in Hollywood to Alaska to film what was then billed as &quot;The Biggest Picture Ever Made.&quot;  Upon arriving in Alaska, they set up &quot;Camp Hollywood&quot; in Northwest Alaska, where they lived during the duration of the filming.  [[Louis B. Mayer]] spared no expense in spite of the remote location, going so far as to hire the chef from the [[Roosevelt Hotel (Hollywood)|Hotel Roosevelt]] in Hollywood to prepare meals.

When ''Eskimo'' premiered at the [[Astor Theatre]] in New York City, the studio received the largest amount of feedback in its history to that point. ''Eskimo'' was critically acclaimed and released worldwide; as a result, Mala became an international movie star. ''Eskimo'' won the first Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] at the Academy Awards, and showcased and preserved aspects of [[Inupiat people|Inupiat]] culture on film.

The 1983 Disney movie ''[[Never Cry Wolf (film)|Never Cry Wolf]]'' was at least partially shot in Alaska. The 1991 film ''[[White Fang (1991 film)|White Fang]]'', based on [[Jack London]]'s novel and starring [[Ethan Hawke]], was filmed in and around [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]]. [[Steven Seagal]]'s 1994 ''[[On Deadly Ground]]'', starring [[Michael Caine]], was filmed in part at the [[Worthington Glacier]] near [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filminamerica.com/Movies/OnDeadlyGround/ |title=On Deadly Ground |publisher=Filminamerica.com |accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1999 [[John Sayles]] film ''[[Limbo (1999 film)|Limbo]]'', starring [[David Strathairn]], [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]], and [[Kris Kristofferson]], was filmed in Juneau.

The psychological thriller ''[[Insomnia (2002 film)|Insomnia]]'', starring [[Al Pacino]] and [[Robin Williams]], was shot in Canada, but was set in Alaska. The 2007 film directed by Sean Penn, ''[[Into the Wild (film)|Into The Wild]]'', was partially filmed and set in Alaska. The film, which is based on the novel of the same name, follows the adventures of [[Christopher McCandless]], who died in a remote abandoned bus along the [[Stampede Trail]] west of [[Healy, Alaska|Healy]] in 1992.

Many films and television shows set in Alaska are not filmed there; for example, ''[[Northern Exposure]]'', set in the fictional town of Cicely, Alaska, was filmed in [[Roslyn, Washington]]. The 2007 horror feature ''[[30 Days of Night (film)|30 Days of Night]]'' is set in [[Barrow, Alaska|Barrow]], but was filmed in New Zealand.

Many [[reality television]] shows are filmed in Alaska. In 2011 the ''Anchorage Daily News'' found ten set in the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;hopkins20110214&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.adn.com/2011/02/14/1699528/alaska-based-shows-what-do-the.html | title=Rating the Alaska reality shows: The best and the worst | work=Anchorage Daily News | date=February 14, 2011 | accessdate=March 2, 2013 | author=Hopkins, Kyle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Agriculture}}

'''Agriculture''', also called '''farming''' or '''husbandry''', is the cultivation of [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[Fungus|fungi]], and other life forms for [[food]], [[fiber]], [[biofuel]], [[medicinal]]s and other products used to sustain and enhance human life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Office1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author= |title=Safety and health in agriculture |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GtBa6XIW_aQC&amp;pg=PA77 |year=1999 |publisher=International Labour Organization |isbn=978-92-2-111517-5 |pages=77– |accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture was the key development in the rise of [[sedentism|sedentary]] [[human civilization]], whereby farming of [[domestication|domesticated]] species created food [[economic surplus|surpluses]] that nurtured the development of [[civilization]]. The study of agriculture is known as [[agricultural science]]. The [[history of agriculture]] dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different [[climate]]s, cultures, and technologies. However, all farming generally relies on techniques to expand and maintain the lands that are suitable for raising domesticated species. For plants, this usually requires some form of [[irrigation]], although there are methods of [[dryland farming]]. [[Livestock]] are raised in a combination of grassland-based and landless systems, in an industry that covers almost one-third of the world's ice- and water-free area. In the developed world, [[industrial agriculture]] based on large-scale [[monoculture]] has become the dominant system of modern farming, although there is growing support for [[sustainable agriculture]], including [[permaculture]] and [[organic farming|organic agriculture]].

Until the [[Industrial Revolution]], the vast majority of the human population labored in agriculture. Pre-industrial agriculture was typically [[subsistence agriculture]]/[[self-sufficiency]] in which farmers raised most of their crops for their own consumption instead of [[cash crop]]s for trade. A remarkable shift in agricultural practices has occurred over the past century in response to new technologies, and the development of world markets. This also has led to technological improvements in agricultural techniques, such as the [[Haber-Bosch]] method for synthesizing [[ammonium nitrate]] which made the traditional practice of recycling [[nutrient]]s with [[crop rotation]] and animal [[manure]] less important.

Modern [[agronomy]], [[plant breeding]], [[agrochemical]]s such as [[pesticide]]s and [[fertilizers]], and technological improvements have sharply increased yields from cultivation, but at the same time have caused widespread ecological damage and negative human health effects. [[Selective breeding]] and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat, but have raised concerns about [[animal welfare]] and the health effects of the [[antibiotics]], [[growth hormones]], and other chemicals commonly used in industrial meat production. [[Genetically modified organisms]] are an increasing component of agriculture, although they are banned in several countries. Agricultural food production and water management are increasingly becoming global issues that are fostering debate on a number of fronts. Significant degradation of land and water resources, including the depletion of [[aquifer]]s, has been observed in recent decades, and the effects of global warming on agriculture and of agriculture on global warming are still not fully understood.

The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers, [[fuel]]s, and [[raw material]]s. Specific foods include [[cereal]]s (grains), [[vegetable]]s, [[fruit]]s, [[cooking oil|oils]], [[meat]]s and [[spice]]s. Fibers include [[cotton]], [[wool]], [[hemp]], [[silk]] and [[flax]]. Raw materials include [[lumber]] and [[bamboo]]. Other useful materials are produced by plants, such as [[resin]]s, [[natural dye|dyes]], [[drug]]s, [[perfume]]s, [[biofuel]]s and ornamental products such as [[Floriculture|cut flowers]] and [[nursery (horticulture)|nursery plants]]. Over one third of the world's workers are employed in agriculture, second only to the services sector, although the percentages of agricultural workers in developed countries has decreased significantly over the past several centuries.

==Etymology and terminology==
The word ''agriculture'' is a late [[Middle English]] adaptation of Latin ''agricultūra'', from ''ager'', &quot;field&quot;, and ''cultūra'', &quot;[[Tillage|cultivation]]&quot; or &quot;growing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=14|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Word Histories|editor=Chantrell, Glynnis|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=0-19-863121-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture usually refers to human activities, although it is also observed in certain species of [[ant]], [[termite]] and [[ambrosia beetle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.36.102003.152626|title=The Evolution of Agriculture in Insects|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|volume=36|pages=563–595|date=December 2005|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.36.102003.152626|author=Ulrich G. Mueller, Nicole M. Gerardo, Duur K. Aanen, Diana L. Six, and Ted R. Schultz}}&lt;/ref&gt; To practice agriculture means to use natural resources to &quot;produce commodities which maintain life, including food, fiber, forest products, horticultural crops, and their related services.&quot;&lt;ref name=Maine/&gt; This definition includes [[arable farming]] or [[agronomy]], and [[horticulture]], all terms for the growing of plants, [[animal husbandry]] and [[forestry]].&lt;ref name=Maine&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maine.gov/education/aged/definition.html|title=Definition of Agriculture|publisher=State of Maine|accessdate=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction is sometimes made between forestry and agriculture, based on the former's longer management rotations, extensive versus intensive management practices and development mainly by nature, rather than by man. Even then, it is acknowledged that there is a large amount of knowledge transfer and overlap between [[silviculture]] (the management of forests) and agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=15–16|url=http://books.google.com/?id=VMw9VcLT-FYC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=differences+between+forestry+and+agriculture#v=onepage&amp;q=differences%20between%20forestry%20and%20agriculture&amp;f=false|title=Forestry Research: A Mandate for Change|author=Committee on Forestry Research, National Research Council|publisher=National Academies Press|year=1990|isbn=0-309-04248-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In traditional farming, the two are often combined even on small landholdings, leading to the term [[agroforestry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/80364e/80364E04.htm#Agro-forestry%20and%20forest%20laws,%20policies,%20and%20customs|chapter=Applicability of agro-forestry systems|author=Budowski, Gerardo|publisher=United Nations University|title=Agro-forestry in the African Humid Tropics|editor=MacDonald, L.H.|year=1982|isbn=92-808-0364-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ClaySumerianSickle.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Sumer]]ian harvester's sickle made from baked clay (ca. 3000&amp;nbsp;BC).]]
Agricultural practices such as [[irrigation]], [[crop rotation]], application of [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s, and the [[domestication]] of livestock were developed long ago, but have made great progress in the past century. The [[history of agriculture]] has played a major role in [[history of the world|human history]], as agricultural progress has been a crucial factor in worldwide [[social change|socio-economic change]]. [[Division of labour]] in agricultural societies made commonplace specializations rarely seen in [[hunter-gatherer]] cultures, which allowed the growth of towns and cities, and the complex societies we call [[civilization]]s. When farmers became capable of producing food beyond the needs of their own families, others in their society were free to devote themselves to projects other than food acquisition. Historians and anthropologists have long argued that the development of agriculture made civilization possible. The total [[world population]] probably never exceeded 15 million inhabitants before the development of agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tellier, Luc-Normand|year=2009|url=http://books.google.com/?id=cXuCjDbxC1YC&amp;pg=&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=Urban world history: an economic and geographical perspective|publisher=PUQ|page=26|isbn=2-7605-1588-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to geographer [[Jared Diamond]], the costs of agriculture were: &quot;the average daily number of work hours increased, nutrition deteriorated, infectious disease and body wear increased, and lifespan shortened.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The World Until Yesterday|author=Jared Diamond|page=353|isbn=978-0-670-02481-0|publisher=Viking|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prehistoric origins===
[[Forest gardening]], a plant-based food production system, is thought to be the world's oldest [[agroecosystem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Forest Farms of Kandy: And Other Gardens of Complete Design|author=Douglas John McConnell|year=2003|page=1|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QYBSfUJPQXcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=the%20forest%20farms%20of%20kandy%20and%20other%20gardens%20of%20complete%20design&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-7546-0958-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forest gardens originated in [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] times along jungle-clad river banks and in the wet foothills of [[monsoon]] regions. In the gradual process of a family improving their immediate environment, useful tree and vine species were identified, protected and improved whilst undesirable species were eliminated. Eventually superior foreign species were selected and incorporated into the family's garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The forest-garden farms of Kandy, Sri Lanka|author=Douglas John McConnell|year=1992|page=1|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=G3QPo7lThXsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=The%20forest-garden%20farms%20of%20Kandy%2C%20Sri%20Lanka.&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=978-92-5-102898-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neolithic===
{{Further|Neolithic Revolution}}
[[File:Trilla del trigo en el Antiguo Egipto.jpg|thumb|Threshing of grain in ancient Egypt]]
The [[Fertile Crescent]] of [[Western Asia]] first saw the domestication of animals, starting the Neolithic Revolution. Between 10,000 and 13,000 years ago, the ancestors of modern cattle, sheep, goats and pigs were domesticated in this area. The gradual transition from wild harvesting to deliberate cultivation happened independently in several areas around the globe.&lt;ref name=NatGeo/&gt; Agriculture allowed for the support of an increased population, leading to larger societies and eventually the development of cities. It also created the need for greater organization of political power (and the creation of [[social stratification]]), as decisions had to be made regarding labor and harvest allocation and access rights to water and land. Agriculture bred immobility, as populations settled down for long periods of time, which led to the accumulation of material goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anthro.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/arch/neolithic/Neo3-LivRev.html|title= Living the Revolution|author=DK Jordan|date=24 November 2012|work=The Neolithic|publisher=University of California – San Diego|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early [[Neolithic]] villages show evidence of the ability to process grain, and the Near East is the ancient home of the ancestors of [[wheat]], [[barley]] and [[pea]]s. There is evidence of the cultivation of [[Common fig|fig]]s in the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]] as long as 11,300 years ago, and [[cereal]] (grain) production in Syria approximately 9,000 years ago. During the same period, farmers in China began to farm [[rice]] and [[millet]], using man-made floods and fires as part of their cultivation regimen.&lt;ref name=NatGeo&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/development-of-agriculture/|title=The Development of Agriculture|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiber crops were domesticated as early as food crops, with China domesticating [[hemp]], [[cotton]] being developed independently in Africa and South America, and the Near East domesticating [[flax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Plant evolution and the origin of crop species|page=119|author=Hancock, James F.|url=http://books.google.com/?id=j_O9ZnFRNngC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=domestication+of+fiber+crops#v=onepage&amp;q=domestication%20of%20fiber%20crops&amp;f=false|publisher=CABI|year=2012|isbn=1-84593-801-1|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of soil amendments, including manure, fish, compost and ashes, appears to have begun early, and developed independently in several areas of the world, including [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Nile Valley]] and Eastern Asia.&lt;ref name=FertMan&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=qPkoOU4BvEsC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=history+of+fertilizer#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20of%20fertilizer&amp;f=false|page=46|author=UN Industrial Development Organization, [[International Fertilizer Development Center]]|title=The Fertilizer Manual|publisher=Springer|year=1998|edition=3rd|isbn=0-7923-5032-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Harvester.jpg|thumb|Roman harvesting machine|left]]
[[Squash (plant)|Squash]] was grown in Mexico nearly 10,000 years ago, while [[maize]]-like plants, derived from the wild [[teosinte]], began to be seen at around 9,000 years ago. The derivation of teosinte into modern corn was slow, however, and it took until 5,500&lt;ref name=NatGeo/&gt; to 6,000 years ago to turn into what we know today as maize. It then gradually spread across North America and was the major crop of Native Americans at the time of European exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=S. Johannessen and C. A. Hastorf (eds.) |title=Corn and Culture in the Prehistoric New World|publisher= Westview Press|location=Boulder, Colorado|year=1994|isbn=0-8133-8375-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bean]]s were domesticated around the same time, and together these three plants formed the [[Three Sisters (agriculture)|Three Sisters]] nutritional foundation of many native populations in North and Central America. Combined with peppers, these crops provided a balanced diet for much of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anthro.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/arch/neolithic/Neo2-Beyond.html|title= Beyond Wheat|author=DK Jordan|date=24 November 2012|work=The Neolithic|publisher=University of California – San Diego|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grape]]s were first grown for [[wine]] approximately 8,000 years ago, in the [[Southern Caucasus]], and by 3000 BC had spread to the Fertile Crescent, the Jordan Valley and Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/sciencefair/post/2011/01/domestics-grape-genome-sequenced/1#.UYWuIcrEl-A|title=Grapes domesticated 8,000 years ago|author=Vergano, Dan|date=19 January 2011|accessdate=4 May 2013|journal=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From about 5,000 years ago, nomads spread westward of East Asian and Southwest Asian crops eastward. They incorporated regional crops into their economy and farmed them, so moving several strains of ancient grains and peas across Eurasia. &lt;ref&gt;http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/281/1783/20133382&lt;/ref&gt;

Agriculture advanced to Europe slightly later, reaching the northeast of the continent from the east around 4000 BC. The idea that agriculture spread to Europe, rather than independently developing there, has led to two main hypotheses. The first is a &quot;wave of advance&quot;, which holds that agriculture traveled slowly and steadily across the continent, while the second, &quot;population pulse&quot; theory, holds that it moved in jumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anthro.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/arch/neolithic/Neo1-AgRev.html|title= The &quot;Agricultural Revolution&quot;|author=DK Jordan|date=24 November 2012|work=The Neolithic|publisher=University of California – San Diego|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also around 6000 years ago, horses first began to be domesticated in the Eurasian [[steppe]]s. Initially used for food, it was quickly discovered that they were useful for field work and carrying goods and people.&lt;ref name=Horse&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/pubs/HorseHistory/intro.shtml|title=Horses in History: A Bibliography|publisher=USDA National Agricultural Library|accessdate=24 May 2013|author=Adams, Kristina}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 5,000 years ago, [[sunflower]]s were first cultivated in North America, while South America's [[Andes|Andes region]] was developing the [[potato]].&lt;ref name=NatGeo/&gt; A minor center of domestication, the indigenous peoples of the eastern United States appear to have domesticated numerous crops, including [[tobacco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Heiser, Carl B., Jr.|year=1992|title= On Possible Sources of the Tobacco of Prehistoric Eastern North America|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=33|pages=54–56|doi=10.1086/204032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bronze and Iron Ages===
Beginning around 3000 BC, nomadic [[pastoralism]], with societies focused on the care of livestock for subsistence, appeared independently in several areas in Europe and Asia. The main region was the [[steppe]]s stretching from the [[Hungarian Plain]] to [[Manchuria]], where cattle, sheep, horses, and to a lesser extent [[yak]]s and [[bactrian camel]]s provided sustenance. The second was in [[Arabia]], where [[dromedary|one-humped camels]] were the main animal, with sheep, goats and horses also seen. The third area was a band of societies in areas of eastern and central Africa with a [[tropical savannah]] climate. Cattle and goats were found most often in this area, with smaller numbers of sheep, horses and camels. A fourth area, more minor than the others, was found in northern Europe and Asia and was focused on [[reindeer]] herding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/Richerson/BooksOnline/101text.htm Principles of Human Ecology]|pages=79–80|url=http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/Richerson/BooksOnline/He5-95.pdf|title=Chapter 5: Pastoral Societies|author=Richerson, Peter J.|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2500 and 2000 BC, the simplest form of the [[plough]], called the [[ard (plough)|ard]], spread throughout Europe, replacing the [[hoe (tool)|hoe]]. This change in equipment significantly increased cultivation ability, and affected the demand for land, as well as ideas about property, inheritance and family rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=cHRvtwTLcMAC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=ard+plough+3500+BC#v=onepage&amp;q=ard%20plough%203500%20BC&amp;f=false|page=28|title=Cambridge Economic History of Europe: Vol. 2: Trade and Industry in the Middle Ages|editor=Michael Moïssey Postan, H.

These tools would have also been easier to transport, which was a benefit as people only stayed until the soil's nutrients were depleted. However, as the continuous cultivating of smaller pieces of land became a sustaining practice throughout the world, ards were much more efficient than digging sticks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Seventy Great Inventions of the Ancient World|author=Brian M.

Agricultural technology continued to improve, allowing the expansion of available crop varieties, including a wide range of fruits, vegetables, oil crops, spices and other products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/empires/egypt/newkingdom/farming.html|title=Farming|work=Egypt's Golden Empire|publisher=PBS|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/hort_306/text/lec18.pdf|title=Roman Agricultural History|author=Janick, Jules|year=2008|publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; China was also an important center for agricultural technology development during this period. During the [[Zhou dynasty]] (1666–221 BC), the first canals were built, and irrigation was used extensively. The later [[Three Kingdoms]] and [[Northern dynasty|Northern]] and [[Southern dynasty|Southern dynasties]] (221–581 AD) brought the first biological pest control, extensive writings on agricultural topics and technological innovations such as [[steel]] and the [[wheelbarrow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/hort_306/text/lec12.pdf|format=PDF|title=History of Agricultural and Horticultural Technology in Asia|author=Janick, Jules|publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=23 May 2013|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ancient world, fresh products, such as meats, dairy products and fresh fruits and vegetables, were likely consumed relatively close to where they were produced. Less perishable products, such as grains, preserved foods, olive oil and wine, were often traded over an extensive network of land and sea routes. The ancient trade in agricultural goods was well established, with wine traded in the Mediterranean region in the 6th century BC and Rome receiving extensive shipments of grain as tax payments by the 2nd century BC. Huge amounts of grain were transported, mainly by sea, and it was during this period that the subsidization of grain farming began, for the prevention of famine. Ancient Rome was a major center for agricultural trade. Trade routes stretched from Britain and Scandinavia in the west to India and China in the east, and included major crops, such as grain, wine and olive oil (also a fuel for [[oil lamp]]s), as well as additional products, including spices, fabrics and drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=194–196|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome|url=http://books.google.com/?id=9JJdqJ8YGH8C&amp;pg=PA195&amp;lpg=PA195&amp;dq=ancient+grain+trade#v=onepage&amp;q=ancient%20grain%20trade&amp;f=false|author=Lesley Adkins, Roy A.

In [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], many scholars documented farming techniques, including the use of fertilizers.&lt;ref name=FertMan/&gt; Much of what was believed about farming and plant nutrition at this time was later found to be incorrect, but their theories provided the scientific foundation for the development of agricultural theories through the [[Middle Ages]]. Ideas about soil fertility and fertilization remained much the same from the time of Greco-Roman scholars until the 19th century, with correspondingly low crop yields.&lt;ref name=FertMan/&gt; By the time of [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquests (330–323 BC), the role of horses had developed, and they played a huge role in warfare and agriculture. Innovations continued to be developed which allowed them to work longer, harder and more efficiently. By medieval times they became the primary source of power for agriculture, transport and warfare, a position they held until the development of the [[steam engine|steam]] and [[internal combustion]] engines.&lt;ref name=Horse/&gt; The [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] culture developed several innovations in agriculture during its peak, which ranged from 400 BC to 900 AD and was heavily dependent upon agriculture to support its population.

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Crescenzi calendar.jpg|thumb|Agricultural calendar from a manuscript of [[Pietro de Crescenzi]].]]
The Middle Ages saw significant improvements in the agricultural techniques and technology. During this time period, monasteries spread throughout Europe and became important centers for the collection of knowledge related to agriculture and forestry. The [[manorial system]], which existed under different names throughout Europe and Asia, allowed large landowners significant control over both their land and its laborers, in the form of peasants or [[serf]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/hcs/TMI/HCS210/HortOrigins/MiddleAges.html|title=Medieval Horticulture/Agriculture|publisher=Ohio State University|accessdate=24 April 2013|author=Jourdan, Pablo}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the medieval period, the [[Arab world]] was critical in the exchange of crops and technology between the European, Asia and African continents. Besides transporting numerous crops, they introduced the concept of summer irrigation to Europe and developed the beginnings of the [[plantation]] system of [[sugarcane]] growing through the use of slaves for intensive cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/hort_306/text/lec22.pdf|title=Islamic Influences on Western Agriculture|author=Janick, Jules|year=2008|publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Population continued to increase along with land use.

By 900 AD in Europe, developments in [[smelting|iron smelting]] allowed for increased production, leading to developments in the production of agricultural implements such as ploughs, hand tools and [[horse shoe]]s. The plough was significantly improved, developing into the [[mouldboard plough#Mouldboard plough|mouldboard plough]], capable of turning over the heavy, wet soils of northern Europe. This led to the clearing of forests in that area and a significant increase in agricultural production, which in turn led to an increase in population.&lt;ref name=Backer/&gt; A similar plough, which may have developed independently, was also found in China as early as the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=SaJlbWK_-FcC&amp;pg=PA270&amp;lpg=PA270&amp;dq=medieval+china+agriculture#v=onepage&amp;q=medieval%20china%20agriculture&amp;f=false|author=Glick, Thomas F.|page=270|title=Medieval Science, Technology And Medicine: An Encyclopedia|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2005|isbn=0-415-96930-1|series=Volume 11 of The Routledge Encyclopedias of the Middle Ages Series}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, farmers in Europe moved from a two field [[crop rotation]] to a three field crop rotation in which one field of three was left fallow every year. This resulted in increased productivity and nutrition, as the change in rotations led to different crops being planted, including [[legumes]] such as peas, lentils and beans. Inventions such as improved [[horse harness]]es and the [[whippletree (mechanism)|whippletree]] also changed methods of cultivation.&lt;ref name=Backer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engr.sjsu.edu/pabacker/history/middle.htm|title=Part 1 – Medieval European history |author= Backer, Patricia|publisher=San Jose State University|accessdate=24 April 2013|work=History of Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Watermill]]s were initially developed by the Romans, but were improved throughout the Middle Ages, along with [[windmill]]s, and used to grind grains into flour, cut wood and process flax and wool, among other uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=1-mss7-OStgC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=development+of+watermills+and+windmills#v=onepage&amp;q=development%20of%20watermills%20and%20windmills&amp;f=false|title=Daily Life in the Middle Ages|author=Newman, Paul B.|pages=88–89|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-7864-5052-5|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greenland]] and [[Iceland]] were settled by Europeans during this period, and supported agricultural activities. The long-term warming period is generally thought to have occurred mainly in Europe, but other areas of the world experienced shorter warming periods at different times during this period, including China in the 11th and 12th centuries, with similar effects on agriculture. The climate variations found in Europe during the Medieval Warm Period returned to more moderate levels in the 15th century, and terminated in the [[Little Ice Age]] of the 16th-mid 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.meteo.psu.edu/holocene/public_html/Mann/articles/articles/medclimopt.pdf|chapter=Medieval Climactic Optimum|author=Mann, Michael E.|title=Encyclopedia of Global Environmental Change|volume=1|editor=Munn, Ted|year=2002|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|pages=514–516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder- The Harvesters - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The Harvesters (painting)|The Harvesters]]''. [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]] – 1565]]
After 1492, a [[Columbian exchange|global exchange]] of previously local crops and livestock breeds occurred. Key crops involved in this exchange included [[maize]], potatoes, [[sweet potatoes]] and [[manioc]] traveling from the New World to the Old, and several varieties of wheat, barley, rice and [[turnip]]s going from the Old World to the New. There were very few livestock species in the New World, with horses, cattle, sheep and goats being completely unknown before their arrival with Old World settlers. Crops moving in both directions across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] caused population growth around the world, and had a lasting effect on many cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/american-indians/essays/columbian-exchange|title=The Columbian Exchange|publisher=The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History|author=Crosby, Alfred|accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since being introduced by Portuguese in the 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/suprtubr.htm |title=Super-Sized Cassava Plants May Help Fight Hunger In Africa|publisher=The Ohio State University|author=Wagner, Holly|accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; maize and manioc have replaced traditional African crops as the continent's most important staple food crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/briefs/16/default.html|title=Advances in Maize Streak Virus Disease Research in Eastern and Southern Africa|editor=Florence Wambugu and John Wafula|year=2000|publisher=International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications|accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After its introduction from South America to Spain in the late 1500s, the potato became an important staple crop throughout Europe by the late 1700s. The potato allowed farmers to produce more food, and initially added variety to the European diet. The nutrition boost caused by increased potato consumption resulted in lower disease rates, higher birth rates and lower mortality rates, causing a population boom throughout the [[British Empire]], the US and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.history-magazine.com/potato.html |title=The Impact of the Potato|journal=History Magazine|author=Chapman, Jeff|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of the potato also brought about the first intensive use of fertilizer, in the form of [[guano]] imported to Europe from Peru, and the first artificial pesticide, in the form of an [[arsenic]] compound used to fight [[Colorado potato beetle]]s. Before the adoption of the potato as a major crop, the dependence on grain caused repetitive regional and national [[famine]]s when the crops failed: 17 major famines in England alone between 1523 and 1623. Although initially almost eliminating the danger of famine, the resulting dependence on the potato eventually caused the [[European Potato Failure]], a disastrous crop failure from [[potato blight|disease]] resulting in widespread famine, and the death of over one million people in Ireland alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/How-the-Potato-Changed-the-World.html|title=How the Potato Changed History|author=Mann, Charles C.|journal=Smithsonian|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Agricultural Revolution, with its massive increases in agricultural productivity and net output, is a topic of ongoing debate among historians and agricultural scholars. The changes in agriculture in Britain between the 16th and 19th centuries would subsequently affect agriculture around the world. Major points of development included [[enclosure]], [[mechanization]], [[crop rotation]] and [[selective breeding]]. Prior to the 1960s, historians viewed the British Agricultural Revolution of having been &quot;largely facilitated by a small number of key innovators,&quot; including [[Robert Bakewell (farmer)|Robert Bakewell]],&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://lra.le.ac.uk/handle/2381/1407|title=Zooarchaeology, improvement and the British agricultural revolution|author=Thomas, Richard M.|journal=International Journal of Historical Archaeology|date= June 2005|volume=9|issue=2|pages=71–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester of Holkham|Thomas Coke]] and [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Charles Townshend]]. However, modern historians disperse much of the importance surrounding these individual men, and instead point to them holding a smaller position within a major societal shift regarding agriculture in Britain.

The agricultural changes, along with industrialization and migration, allowed the population of Britain, as well as other countries who followed its model, such as the US, Germany and Belgium, to escape from the [[Malthusian trap]] and increase both their population and their [[standard of living]]. It is estimated that the productivity of wheat in England went up from about 19 bushels per acre in 1720 to 21–22 bushels by the middle of the century and finally stabilized at around 30 bushels by 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Snell|first=K.D.M|title=Annals of the Labouring Poor, Social Change and Agrarian England 1660–1900|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0-521-24548-6}} Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kingsbury&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Noel Kingsbury|year=2009|title=Hybrid: The History and Science of Plant Breeding|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=doItXV8UN1oC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=Malthusian+trap+and+British+Agricultural+Revolution&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WUQC5GLeAe&amp;sig=ztY4ANuKHDcN9JL73JEzGZ1MsqU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=92jYUsH5FcH42QX3tIDwAQ&amp;ved=0CGIQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Malthusian%20trap%20and%20British%20Agricultural%20Revolution&amp;f=false|title=Preparing for the 21st century|author=Kennedy, Paul|page=11|publisher=Random House|year=2011|isbn=0-307-77357-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Premodern agriculture across [[Europe]] was characterized by the [[feudal]] [[open field system]], where farmers worked on strips of land in fields that were held in common; this was inefficient and reduced the incentive to improve productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=J. M.|last=Neeson|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2CqhjjiwLtEC|title=Commoners: Common Right, Enclosure and Social Change in England, 1700–1820|isbn=0-521-56774-2|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1996|pages=11–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many farms began to be [[enclosure movement|enclosed]] by [[yeomen]] who improved the use of their land. This process of [[land reform]] accelerated in the 18th century with special acts of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] to expedite the legal process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaw-Taylor 2001&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|first=Leigh|last=Shaw-Taylor|title=Parliamentary Enclosure and the Emergence of an English Agricultural Proletariat|journal=[[Journal of Economic History]]|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consolidation of large, privately owned holdings, encouraged the improvement of productivity through experimentation by enterprising landowners. By the 1750s, the market for agriculture was substantially commercialized - crop surpluses were routinely sold by the producers on the market or exported elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaw-Taylor 2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gregory&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5liCbG4J9LYC|title=The Dictionary of Human Geography|editor=Derek Gregory, Ron Johnston, Geraldine Pratt, Michael Watts, Sarah Whatmore|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These social changes were coupled with technical improvements. New methods of crop rotation and land use resulted in large additions to the amount of [[arable land]]. The [[four-field crop rotation]] was popularized by [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Charles Townshend]] in the 18th century. The system ([[wheat]], [[turnip]]s, [[barley]] and [[clover]]), opened up a fodder crop and grazing crop allowing [[livestock]] to be bred year-round. Yields of [[cereal]] crops increased as farmers utilized [[nitrogen]]-rich manure and [[nitrogen fixing]]-crops such as [[clover]], increasing the available nitrogen in the soil and removing the limiting factor on cereal productions that had existed prior to the early 19th century. This improved production per farmer led to an increase in population and in the available workforce, creating the labor force needed for the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/agricultural_revolution_01.shtml|title=Agricultural Revolution in England 1500–1850|author=Overton, Mark|date=2 February 2011|accessdate=16 January 2014|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of agriculture into its modern form was made possible through a continuing process of [[mechanised agriculture|mechanization]].&lt;ref name=ASRM/&gt; Prior to this, basic agricultural tools had slowly been improved over centuries of use. The plough, for example, was a heavy implement with wheels in the 1500s. By the 1600s it was lighter, and by 1730, the [[Plough#History#Heavy ploughs|Rotherham plough]] dramatically changed farming with no wheels, [[interchangeable parts]], stronger construction and less weight. During the early 1800s, [[cast iron]] replaced wood for many parts, leading to longer-lasting implements. [[Seed drill]]s had been under development since the early 1500s, but it was [[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Jethro Tull]]'s 1731 invention of a horse-drawn seed drill and horse hoe (a small plough to hoe between crop rows) that would eventually revolutionize planting in Britain, although they would not become popular until the early 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nj8ixXhFgLAC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=seed+drill+invention&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YnbYUtCJKIaTyQG_g4GYBg&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=seed%20drill%20invention&amp;f=false|title=Agricultural Revolution in England: The Transformation of the Agrarian Economy 1500–1850|pages=121–122|author=Overton, Mark|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1996|isbn=0-521-56859-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Meikle]] patented the first practical [[threshing machine]] in 1784.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tityMquMYUsC|title=Scottish Agricultural Implements|author=Bob Powell|year=1988|publisher=Osprey Publishing|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Industrial Revolution]] caused a boom in international trade and shipping. Increased production caused a rise in the need for raw materials, with European merchants purchasing the majority of the goods. The value of goods traded worldwide increased by five times between 1750 and 1914, with annual shipping tonnages increasing from 4 million to 30 million tons between 1800 and 1900. In the second half of the 19th century, trade also expanded in the food (including grain and meat) and wool markets, and England (with the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] in 1846) began to trade quantities of industrial products for wheat from around the world. The vast expansion of [[railroad]]s that followed the invention of the [[steam engine]] further revolutionized world trade, especially in the Americas and East Asia, as goods could now be more easily traded across vast land distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackstudies.ucsb.edu/antillians/trade2.html|title=European Trade|publisher=University of California, Santa Barbara|accessdate=13 September 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602065501/http://www.blackstudies.ucsb.edu/antillians/trade2.html|archivedate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The developments of [[food processing|heat processing]] and [[refrigeration]] in the 19th century led to a similar revolution in the meat industry, as they allowed meat to be shipped long distances without spoiling.

[[File:Agriculture (Plowing) CNE-v1-p58-H.jpg|thumb|Early 20th century image of a tractor ploughing an [[alfalfa]] field.]]
In the mid-1800s, horse drawn machinery, such as the [[McCormick reaper]], revolutionized harvesting, while inventions such as the [[cotton gin]] made possible the processing of large amounts of crops. During this same period, farmers began to use [[Traction engine|steam-powered]] [[threshing machine|threshers]] and [[tractor]]s, although they were found to be expensive, dangerous and a fire hazard. The first [[gasoline engine|gasoline-powered]] tractors were successfully developed around 1900, and in 1923, the [[International Harvester]] [[Farmall]] tractor became the first all-purpose tractor, and marked a major point in the replacement of draft animals (particularly horses) with machines. Since that time, self-propelled mechanical harvesters ([[combine harvester|combines]]), planters, transplanters and other equipment have been developed, further revolutionizing agriculture.&lt;ref name=ASRM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/hort_306/text/lec32.pdf|title=Agricultural Scientific Revolution: Mechanical|author=Janick, Jules|publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These inventions allowed farming tasks to be done with a speed and on a scale previously impossible, leading modern farms to output much greater volumes of high-quality produce per land unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nae.edu/Publications/Bridge/52548/52645.aspx|title=The Impact of Mechanization on Agriculture|journal=The Bridge on Agriculture and Information Technology|date=Fall 2011|volume=41|author=Reid, John F.|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific investigation of fertilization began at the [[Rothamsted Experimental Station]] in 1843 by [[John Bennet Lawes]]. He developed the first commercial process for fertilizer production - the obtaining of ''[[super phosphate|phosphate]]'' from the dissolution of [[coprolite]]s in [[sulphuric acid]].&lt;ref&gt;Coprolite Fertilizer Industry in Britain [http://www.pdmhs.com/PDFs/ScannedBulletinArticles/Bulletin%2014-5%20-%20The%20Origins%20and%20Development%20of%20the%20British%20.pdf] Accessed 3 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909 the revolutionary [[Haber-Bosch]] method to synthesize [[ammonium nitrate]] was first demonstrated; it represented a major breakthrough and allowed [[crop yields]] to overcome previous constraints. In the years after [[World War II]], the use of synthetic fertilizer increased rapidly, in sync with the increasing world population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fertilizer.org/ifa/HomePage/SUSTAINABILITY/Climate-change/A-historical-perspective.html|title=A Historical Perspective|publisher=International Fertilizer Industry Association|accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the tremendous gains in agricultural productivity, famines continued to sweep the globe through the 20th century. Through the effects of climactic events, government policy, war and crop failure, millions of people died in each of at least ten famines between the 1920s and the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/ten-worst-famines-of-the-20th-century-20110815-1iu2w.html|title=Ten worst famines of the 20th century|journal=Sydney Morning Herald|date=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Green Revolution refers to a series of research, development, and [[technology transfer]] initiatives, occurring between the 1940s and the late 1970s, that increased agriculture production around the world, beginning most markedly in the late 1960s. It involved the development of high-yielding varieties of cereal grains, expansion of irrigation infrastructure, modernization of management techniques, distribution of hybridized seeds, synthetic fertilizers, and [[pesticide]]s to farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter B.R. |last=Hazell |title=The Asian Green Revolution |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=frNfVx-KZOcC&amp;pg=PA1 |year=2009 |work=IFPRI Discussion Paper |publisher=Intl Food Policy Res Inst |id=GGKEY:HS2UT4LADZD}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiatives, led by [[Norman Borlaug]], the &quot;Father of the Green Revolution&quot;, are credited with saving hundreds of millions of people from starvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB125281643150406425?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB125281643150406425.html|title=Father of 'Green Revolution' Dies|journal=Wall Street Journal|date=13 September 2009|author=Kilman, Scott and Thurow, Roger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demographer [[Thomas Malthus]] in 1798 famously predicted that the Earth would not be able to support its growing population, but technologies such as those promoted by the Green Revolution have thus far allowed the world to produce a surplus of food.&lt;ref name=&quot;BumperCrop&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/08/business/worldbusiness/08farmers.html |newspaper= The New York Times |title=Sometimes a Bumper Crop Is Too Much of a Good Thing |last=Barrionuevo |first=Alexei |author2=Bradsher, Keith |date=8 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Green Revolution significantly increased rice yields in Asia, yield increases have not occurred in the past 15–20 years. The genetic &quot;yield potential&quot; has increased for wheat, but the yield potential for rice has not increased since 1966, and the yield potential for maize has &quot;barely increased in 35 years&quot;.&lt;ref name=Tilman2002&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tilman D, Cassman KG, Matson PA, Naylor R, Polasky S |title=Agricultural sustainability and intensive production practices |journal=Nature |volume=418 |issue=6898 |pages=671–7 |date=August 2002 |pmid=12167873 |doi=10.1038/nature01014 |url=http://cedarcreek.umn.edu/biblio/fulltext/t1860.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It takes a decade or two for herbicide-resistant weeds to emerge, and insects become resistant to insecticides within about a decade.

In the past century agriculture has been characterized by increased productivity, the substitution of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for labor, [[water pollution]], and [[farm subsidies]].

Disease and land degradation are two of the major concerns in agriculture today.

==Workforce==
As of 2011, the [[International Labour Organization]] states that approximately one billion people, or over 1/3 of the available work force, are employed in the global agricultural sector. Agriculture constitutes approximately 70% of the global employment of children, and in many countries employs the largest percentage of women of any industry.&lt;ref name=ILO/&gt; The [[service sector]] only overtook the agricultural sector as the largest global employer in 2007. Between 1997 and 2007, the percentage of people employed in agriculture fell by over four percentage points, a trend that is expected to continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/story/191279|title=Services sector overtakes farming as world's biggest employer: ILO|author=AP|date=26 January 2007|accessdate=24 April 2013|publisher=''The Financial Express''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of people employed in agriculture varies widely on a per-country basis, ranging from less than 2% in countries like the US and Canada to over 80% in many African nations.&lt;ref name=LaborForce&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2048.html|title=Labor Force – By Occupation|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|work=The World Factbook|accessdate=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In developed countries, these figures are significantly lower than in previous centuries.

===Safety===
[[Image:Ford Tractor with ROPS bar fitted.JPG|right|thumb|[[Rollover protection system|Rollover protection bar]] on a [[Fordson tractor|Fordson]] tractor]]

Agriculture remains a hazardous industry, and farmers worldwide remain at high risk of work-related injuries, lung disease, noise-induced hearing loss, skin diseases, as well as certain cancers related to chemical use and prolonged sun exposure. On [[industrial agriculture|industrialized farms]], injuries frequently involve the use of [[agricultural machinery]], and a common cause of fatal agricultural injuries in developed countries is tractor rollovers.&lt;ref name=&quot;aginjury&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/aginjury/ |title=NIOSH Workplace Safety &amp; Health Topic: Agricultural Injuries|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pesticides and other chemicals used in farming can also be hazardous to worker health, and workers exposed to pesticides may experience illness or have children with birth defects.&lt;ref name=NIOSH_pest&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2012-108/ |title=NIOSH Pesticide Poisoning Monitoring Program Protects Farmworkers|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an industry in which families commonly share in work and live on the farm itself, entire families can be at risk for injuries, illness, and death.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIOSH Agri&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/agriculture/ |title=NIOSH Workplace Safety &amp; Health Topic: Agriculture|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common causes of fatal injuries among young farm workers include drowning, machinery and motor vehicle-related accidents.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIOSH Agri&quot; /&gt;

The International Labour Organization considers agriculture &quot;one of the most hazardous of all economic sectors.&quot;&lt;ref name=ILO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/safework/info/standards-and-instruments/codes/WCMS_161135/lang--en/index.htm|title=Safety and health in agriculture|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=24 April 2013|date=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It estimates that the annual work-related death toll among agricultural employees is at least 170,000, twice the average rate of other jobs. In addition, incidences of death, injury and illness related to agricultural activities often go unreported.&lt;ref name=ILO2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/safework/areasofwork/hazardous-work/WCMS_110188/lang--en/index.htm|title=Agriculture: A hazardous work|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=24 April 2013|date=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has developed the [[Safety and Health in Agriculture Convention, 2001]], which covers the range of risks in the agriculture occupation, the prevention of these risks and the role that individuals and organizations engaged in agriculture should play.&lt;ref name=ILO/&gt;

==Agricultural production systems==

===Crop cultivation systems===
[[File:Paddy fields in India.jpg|thumb|Rice cultivation at a paddy field in [[Bihar]] state of India]]
[[File:Rice terraces.png|thumb|The [[Banaue Rice Terraces]] in [[Ifugao]], Philippines]]
Cropping systems vary among farms depending on the available resources and constraints; geography and climate of the farm; government policy; economic, social and political pressures; and the philosophy and culture of the farmer.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAO FS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization|url=http://www.fao.org/farmingsystems/description_en.htm|title=Analysis of farming systems|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCP APS&quot;&gt;Acquaah, G. 2002. Agricultural Production Systems. pp. 283–317 in &quot;Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology&quot;. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shifting cultivation]] (or [[slash and burn]]) is a system in which forests are burnt, releasing nutrients to support cultivation of annual and then [[perennial plant|perennial]] crops for a period of several years.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot;&gt;Chrispeels, M.J.; Sadava, D.E. 1994. &quot;Farming Systems: Development, Productivity, and Sustainability&quot;. pp. 25–57 in ''Plants, Genes, and Agriculture''. Jones and Bartlett, Boston, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; Then the plot is left fallow to regrow forest, and the farmer moves to a new plot, returning after many more years (10–20). This fallow period is shortened if population density grows, requiring the input of nutrients (fertilizer or [[manure]]) and some manual [[pest control]]. Annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity in which there is no fallow period. This requires even greater nutrient and pest control inputs.

Further industrialization led to the use of [[monoculture]]s, when one [[cultivar]] is planted on a large acreage. Because of the low [[biodiversity]], nutrient use is uniform and pests tend to build up, necessitating the greater use of [[pesticide]]s and fertilizers.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCP APS&quot;/&gt; Multiple cropping, in which several crops are grown sequentially in one year, and [[intercropping]], when several crops are grown at the same time, are other kinds of annual cropping systems known as [[polyculture]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot; /&gt;

In [[subtropics|subtropical]] and [[arid]] environments, the timing and extent of agriculture may be limited by rainfall, either not allowing multiple annual crops in a year, or requiring [[irrigation]]. In all of these environments perennial crops are grown (coffee, chocolate) and systems are practiced such as [[agroforestry]]. In [[Temperateness|temperate]] environments, where ecosystems were predominantly [[grassland]] or [[prairie]], highly productive annual cropping is the dominant farming system.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot;/&gt;

[[File:KerbauJawa.jpg|thumb|right|Ploughing rice paddies with [[water buffalo]], in Indonesia]]
Animals, including horses, [[mule]]s, [[ox]]en, [[water buffalo]], [[camel]]s, [[llama]]s, [[alpaca]]s, [[donkey]]s, and dogs, are often used to help [[Tillage|cultivate]] fields, [[harvest]] crops, wrangle other animals, and transport farm products to buyers. [[Animal husbandry]] not only refers to the breeding and raising of animals for meat or to harvest animal products (like milk, [[egg (food)|eggs]], or [[wool]]) on a continual basis, but also to the breeding and care of species for work and companionship.

Livestock production systems can be defined based on feed source, as [[grassland]]-based, mixed, and landless.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAO lps&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Sere, C.; Steinfeld, H.; Groeneweld, J.|year=1995|url=http://www.fao.org/WAIRDOCS/LEAD/X6101E/x6101e00.htm#Contents|title=Description of Systems in World Livestock Systems – Current status issues and trends|publisher=U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization|accessdate=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, 30% of Earth's ice- and water-free area was used for producing livestock, with the sector employing approximately 1.3 billion people. Between the 1960s and the 2000s, there was a significant increase in livestock production, both by numbers and by carcass weight, especially among beef, pigs and chickens, the latter of which had production increased by almost a factor of 10. Non-meat animals, such as milk cows and egg-producing chickens, also showed significant production increases. Global cattle, sheep and goat populations are expected to continue to increase sharply through 2050.&lt;ref name=LP&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/365/1554/2853.full|title=Livestock production: recent trends, future prospects|author=Thornton, Philip K.|doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0134|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B|date=27 September 2010|volume=365|number= 1554}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aquaculture]] or fish farming, the production of fish for human consumption in confined operations, is one of the fastest growing sectors of food production, growing at an average of 9% a year between 1975 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1663604,00.html|title=Fish Farming's Growing Dangers|journal=Time|author=Stier, Ken|date=19 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second half of the 20th century, producers using [[selective breeding]] focused on creating livestock [[breed]]s and [[crossbreed]]s that increased production, while mostly disregarding the need to preserve [[genetic diversity]]. This trend has led to a significant decrease in genetic diversity and resources among livestock breeds, leading to a corresponding decrease in disease resistance and local adaptations previously found among traditional breeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A global view of livestock biodiversity and conservation – GLOBALDIV|author=P.

Grassland based livestock production relies upon plant material such as [[shrubland]], [[rangeland]], and [[managed intensive rotational grazing|pastures]] for feeding [[ruminant]] animals. Outside nutrient inputs may be used, however manure is returned directly to the grassland as a major nutrient source. This system is particularly important in areas where crop production is not feasible because of climate or soil, representing 30–40 million pastoralists.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot;/&gt; Mixed production systems use grassland, [[fodder]] crops and grain feed crops as feed for ruminant and monogastric (one stomach; mainly chickens and pigs) livestock. Manure is typically recycled in mixed systems as a fertilizer for crops.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAO lps&quot;/&gt;

Landless systems rely upon feed from outside the farm, representing the de-linking of crop and livestock production found more prevalently in [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]](OECD) member countries. Synthetic fertilizers are more heavily relied upon for crop production and manure utilization becomes a challenge as well as a source for pollution.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAO lps&quot;/&gt; Industrialized countries use these operations to produce much of the global supplies of poultry and pork. Scientists estimate that 75% of the growth in livestock production between 2003 and 2030 will be in [[confined animal feeding operations]], sometimes called [[factory farming]]. Much of this growth is happening in developing countries in Asia, with much smaller amounts of growth in Africa.&lt;ref name=LP/&gt; Some of the practices used in commercial livestock production, including the usage of [[growth hormone]]s, are controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-02-604_en.pdf |title=Growth Promoting Hormones Pose Health Risk to Consumers, Confirms EU Scientific Committee|date=23 April 2002|accessdate=6 April 2013|publisher=European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production practices==
[[File:Mt Uluguru and Sisal plantations.jpg|thumb|300px|Road leading across the farm allows machinery access to the farm for production practices.]]
[[Tillage]] is the practice of plowing soil to prepare for planting or for nutrient incorporation or for pest control. Tillage varies in intensity from conventional to [[no-till farming|no-till]]. It may improve productivity by warming the soil, incorporating fertilizer and controlling weeds, but also renders soil more prone to erosion, triggers the decomposition of organic matter releasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and reduces the abundance and diversity of soil organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soil&quot;&gt;Brady, N.C. and R.R.

Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pest control]] includes the management of weeds, [[insect]]s, [[mite]]s, and diseases. Chemical ([[pesticide]]s), biological ([[biocontrol]]), mechanical (tillage), and cultural practices are used. Cultural practices include [[crop rotation]], [[culling]], [[cover crop]]s, [[intercropping]], [[composting]], avoidance, and [[Disease resistance in fruit and vegetables|resistance]]. [[Integrated pest management]] attempts to use all of these methods to keep pest populations below the number which would cause economic loss, and recommends pesticides as a last resort.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCP Pest&quot;&gt;Acquaah, G. 2002. &quot;Pesticide Use in U.S. Crop Production&quot; pp.240–282 in ''Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology''. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nutrient management]] includes both the source of nutrient inputs for crop and livestock production, and the method of utilization of [[manure]] produced by livestock. Nutrient inputs can be chemical inorganic fertilizers, [[manure]], [[green manure]], [[compost]] and mined [[minerals]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PCP Soil&quot;&gt;Acquaah, G. 2002. &quot;Soil and Land&quot; pp.165–210 in ''Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology''.

[[Water management]] is needed where rainfall is insufficient or variable, which occurs to some degree in most regions of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot;/&gt; Some farmers use [[irrigation]] to supplement rainfall. In other areas such as the [[Great Plains]] in the U.S. and Canada, farmers use a [[fallow]] year to conserve soil moisture to use for growing a crop in the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCP Water&quot;&gt;Acquaah, G. 2002. &quot;Plants and Soil Water&quot; pp.211–239 in ''Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology''.

==Crop alteration and biotechnology==
{{Main|Plant breeding}}
[[File:Ueberladewagen (jha).jpg|thumb|[[Tractor]] and [[chaser bin]]]]
Crop alteration has been practiced by humankind for thousands of years, since the beginning of civilization. Altering crops through breeding practices changes the genetic make-up of a plant to develop crops with more beneficial characteristics for humans, for example, larger fruits or seeds, drought-tolerance, or resistance to pests. Significant advances in plant breeding ensued after the work of geneticist [[Gregor Mendel]]. His work on [[dominant allele|dominant]] and [[recessive allele]]s, although initially largely ignored for almost 50 years, gave plant breeders a better understanding of genetics and breeding techniques. Crop breeding includes techniques such as plant selection with desirable traits, [[self-pollination]] and [[cross-pollination]], and molecular techniques that genetically modify the organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cls.casa.colostate.edu/TransgenicCrops/history.html |title=History of Plant Breeding|date=29 January 2004|publisher=Colorado State University|accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestication of plants has, over the centuries increased yield, improved [[disease resistance in fruit and vegetables|disease resistance]] and [[drought tolerance]], eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional value of crop plants. Careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. Plant selection and breeding in the 1920s and 1930s improved pasture (grasses and clover) in [[New Zealand]]. Extensive X-ray and ultraviolet induced mutagenesis efforts (i.e. primitive genetic engineering) during the 1950s produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat, corn (maize) and barley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Stadler |first= L.

The [[Green Revolution]] popularized the use of conventional [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] to sharply increase yield by creating &quot;high-yielding varieties&quot;. For example, average yields of corn (maize) in the USA have increased from around 2.5 tons per hectare (t/ha) (40 bushels per acre) in 1900 to about 9.4 t/ha (150 bushels per acre) in 2001. Similarly, worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than 1 t/ha in 1900 to more than 2.5 t/ha in 1990. South American average wheat yields are around 2 t/ha, African under 1 t/ha, and Egypt and Arabia up to 3.5 to 4 t/ha with irrigation. In contrast, the average wheat yield in countries such as France is over 8 t/ha. Variations in yields are due mainly to variation in climate, genetics, and the level of intensive farming techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical [[pest control]], growth control to avoid lodging).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Ruttan |first= Vernon W. |title= Biotechnology and Agriculture: A Skeptical Perspective |journal= AgBioForum |volume= 2 |issue= 1 |pages= 54–60 |date=December 1999 |url= http://www.agbioforum.org/v2n1/v2n1a10-ruttan.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Cassman |first= K.

[[Genetically Modified Organism]]s (GMO) are [[organism]]s whose [[Genetics|genetic]] material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as [[recombinant DNA technology]]. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/biotech/20questions/en/index.html|title=20 Questions on Genetically Modified Foods|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some, GMO crops cause [[food safety]] and [[food labeling regulations|food labeling]] concerns.

Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including [[glyphosate]]s. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/y5031e/y5031e0i.htm|title=Benefits and risks of the use of herbicide-resistant crops|author=Kathrine Hauge Madsen and Jens Carl Streibig|publisher=FAO|accessdate=4 May 2013|work=Weed Management for Developing Countries}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays.

Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops protect plants from damage by insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aces.uiuc.edu/vista/html_pubs/biotech/insect.htm|title=Insect-resistant Crops Through Genetic Engineering|publisher=University of Illinois|accessdate=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination with wild species. In some cases, wild species are the primary source of resistance traits; some tomato cultivars that have gained resistance to at least 19 diseases did so through crossing with wild populations of tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kimbrell, A.|title=Fatal Harvest: The Tragedy of Industrial Agriculture|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agriculture imposes [[externality|external costs]] upon society through pesticides, nutrient runoff, excessive water usage, loss of natural environment and assorted other problems.

It is one of the largest sources of [[greenhouse gas]]es, responsible for 18% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions as measured in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalents. By comparison, all transportation emits 13.5% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It produces 65% of human-related [[nitrous oxide]] (which has 296 times the global warming potential of CO&lt;sub&gt;2,&lt;/sub&gt;) and 37% of all human-induced [[methane]] (which is 23 times as warming as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.) It also generates 64% of the [[ammonia]] emission. Livestock expansion is cited as a key factor driving [[deforestation]]; in the Amazon basin 70% of [[Deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest|previously forested area]] is now occupied by pastures and the remainder used for feedcrops.&lt;ref name=&quot;LEAD&quot;&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080625012113/http://www.virtualcentre.org/en/library/key_pub/longshad/A0701E00.pdf |archivedate=25 June 2008 |last1=Steinfeld |first1=H. |last2=Gerber |first2=P. |last3=Wassenaar |first3=T. |last4=Castel |first4=V. |last5=Rosales |first5=M. |last6=de Haan |first6=C. |year=2006 |publisher=U.N.

An alternative argument is that the way to 'save the environment' and prevent famine is by using pesticides and intensive high yield farming, a view exemplified by a quote heading the Center for Global Food Issues website: 'Growing more per acre leaves more land for nature'.&lt;ref name=&quot;DAvery&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Avery, D.T.|year=2000|title=Saving the Planet with Pesticides and Plastic: The Environmental Triumph of High-Yield Farming|publisher=Hudson Institute|location=Indianapolis, IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Center for Global Food Issues|url=http://www.cgfi.org/ |title=Home|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics argue that a trade-off between the environment and a need for food is not inevitable,&lt;ref name=&quot;WH&quot;&gt;Lappe, F.M., J.

===Climate change===
{{see also|Climate change and agriculture}}
[[Climate change]] has the potential to affect agriculture through changes in temperature, rainfall (timing and quantity), [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[solar radiation]] and the interaction of these elements.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot;/&gt; Extreme events, such as droughts and floods, are forecast to increase as climate change takes hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Harvey, Fiona|date=18 November 2011|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/nov/18/extreme-weather-climate-change-ipcc|title=Extreme weather will strike as climate change takes hold, IPCC warns|journal=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture is among sectors most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change; water supply for example, will be critical to sustain agricultural production and provide the increase in food output required to sustain the world's growing population. Fluctuations in the flow of rivers are likely to increase in the twenty-first century. Based on the experience of countries in the Nile river basin (Ethiopia, Kenya and Sudan) and other developing countries, depletion of water resources during seasons crucial for agriculture can lead to a decline in yield by up to 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/11374Nile%20concise.pdf|title=Report: Blue Peace for the Nile|publisher=Strategic Foresight Group|accessdate=20 August 2013|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transformational approaches will be needed to manage natural resources in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bs-agro.com/index.php/20152-pessimism-about-future-grows-in-agribusiness|title=World: Pessimism about future grows in agribusiness}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, policies, practices and tools promoting climate-smart agriculture will be important, as will better use of scientific information on climate for assessing risks and vulnerability. Planners and policy-makers will need to help create suitable policies that encourage funding for such agricultural transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network]]|url=http://cdkn.org/resource/srex-lessons-for-the-agricultural-sector/?loclang=en_gb|title=SREX: Lessons for the agricultural sector|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agriculture can both mitigate or worsen [[global warming]]. Some of the increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] comes from the [[decomposition]] of [[organic matter]] in the soil, and much of the methane emitted into the atmosphere is caused by the decomposition of organic matter in wet soils such as [[rice paddy|rice paddies]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Soils OM&quot;&gt;Brady, N.C. and R.R. Weil. 2002. &quot;Soil Organic Matter&quot; pp. 353–385 in ''Elements of the Nature and Properties of Soils''. Pearson Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the normal digestive activities of farm animals. Further, wet or [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] soils also lose nitrogen through [[denitrification]], releasing the greenhouse gases [[nitric oxide]] and nitrous oxide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soils N&quot;&gt;Brady, N.C. and R.R. Weil. 2002. &quot;Nitrogen and Sulfur Economy of Soils&quot; pp. 386–421 in ''Elements of the Nature and Properties of Soils''. Pearson Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in management can reduce the release of these greenhouse gases, and soil can further be used to [[carbon capture and storage|sequester]] some of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soils OM&quot;/&gt;

There are several factors within the field of agriculture that contribute to the large amount of CO2 emissions. The diversity of the sources ranges from the production of farming tools to the transport of harvested produce. Approximately 8% of the national carbon footprint is due to agricultural sources. Of that, 75% is of the carbon emissions released from the production of crop assisting chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hillier|first=Jonathon|author2=C. Hawes|author3=G. Squire|author4=A. Hilton|title=The carbon footprints of food crop production|journal=International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability|year=2009|volume=7|issue=2|pages=107–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Factories producing insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and fertilizers are a major culprit of the greenhouse gas. Productivity on the farm itself and the use of machinery is another source of the carbon emission. Almost all the industrial machines used in modern farming are powered by fossil fuels. These instruments are burning fossil fuels from the beginning of the process to the end. Tractors are the root of this source. The tractor is going to burn fuel and release CO2 just to run. The amount of emissions from the machinery increase with the attachment of different units and need for more power. During the soil preparation stage tillers and plows will be used to disrupt the soil. During growth watering pumps and sprayers are used to keep the crops hydrated. And when the crops are ready for picking a forage or combine harvester is used. These types of machinery all require additional energy which leads to increased carbon dioxide emissions from the basic tractors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lal|first=Rattan|title=Carbon emission from farm operations|journal=Environmental International|year=2004|volume=30|issue=7|pages=981–990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final major contribution to CO2 emissions in agriculture is in the final transport of produce. Local farming suffered a decline over the past century due to large amounts of farm subsidies. The majority of crops are shipped hundreds of miles to various processing plants before ending up in the grocery store. This shipments are made using fossil fuel burning modes of transportation. Inevitably these transport adds to carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=West|first=T.O.|author2=G. Marland|title=Net carbon flux from agricultural ecosystems: methodology for full carbon cycle analyses|journal=Environmental Pollution|year=2002|volume=116|issue=3|pages=439–444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainability===
{{See also|List of sustainable agriculture topics}}
Some major organisations are hailing farming within [[agroecosystems]] as the way forward for mainstream agriculture. Current farming methods have resulted in over-stretched water resources, high levels of erosion and reduced soil fertility. According to a report by the [[International Water Management Institute]] and [[UNEP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Boelee, E. (Ed)|url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/topics/ecosystems/|title=Ecosystems for water and food security|year=2011|publisher=IWMI/UNEP|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is not enough water to continue farming using current practices; therefore how critical water, land, and [[ecosystem]] resources are used to boost crop yields must be reconsidered. The report suggested assigning value to ecosystems, recognizing environmental and livelihood tradeoffs, and balancing the rights of a variety of users and interests. Inequities that result when such measures are adopted would need to be addressed, such as the reallocation of water from poor to rich, the clearing of land to make way for
more productive farmland, or the preservation of a wetland system that limits fishing rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Molden, D.|url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/news_room/pdf/The-scientist_com-Opinion_The%20Water_Deficit.pdf |title=Opinion: The Water Deficit|format=PDF|publisher=''The Scientist''|accessdate=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technological advancements help provide farmers with tools and resources to make farming more sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://croplife.intraspin.com/pesticides/paper.asp?id=461|author=Safefood Consulting, Inc.|title=Benefits of Crop Protection Technologies on Canadian Food Production, Nutrition, Economy and the Environment|year=2005|publisher=CropLife International|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; New technologies have given rise to innovations like [[Tillage#Conservation tillage|conservation tillage]], a farming process which helps prevent land loss to erosion, water pollution and enhances carbon sequestration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Trewavas, Anthony|title=A critical assessment of organic farming-and-food assertions with particular respect to the UK and the potential environmental benefits of no-till agriculture|journal=Crop Protection |year=2004|pages=757–781|doi=10.1016/j.cropro.2004.01.009|volume=23|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is related to the greater efficiency of farming, combined with the increased level of [[value added|value addition]] (e.g. more highly processed products) provided by the supply chain. [[Market concentration]] has increased in the sector as well, and although the total effect of the increased market concentration is likely increased efficiency, the changes redistribute [[economic surplus]] from producers (farmers) and consumers, and may have negative implications for rural communities.&lt;ref name=Sexton2000&gt;{{cite journal |author= Sexton, R.J. |year= 2000 |title= Industrialization and Consolidation in the US Food Sector: Implications for Competition and Welfare |journal= American Journal of Agricultural Economics |volume= 82 |issue= 5 |pages= 1087–1104 |doi= 10.1111/0002-9092.00106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National government policies can significantly change the economic marketplace for agricultural products, in the form of taxation, [[subsidies]], [[tariffs]] and other measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/4101/WPS4864.pdf?sequence=1|title=How Do Agricultural Policy Restrictions to Global Trade and Welfare Differ across Commodities?|author=Peter J.

In the 1980s, it was clear that non-subsidized farmers in developing countries were experiencing adverse affects from national policies that created artificially low global prices for farm products. Between the mid-1980s and the early 2000s, several international agreements were put into place that limited agricultural tariffs, subsidies and other trade restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/8699/wps3901.pdf?sequence=1|title=Do Global Trade Distortions Still Harm Developing Country Farmers?|author=Kym Anderson and Ernesto Valenzuela|work=World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 3901|date=April 2006|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=16 April 2013|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as of 2009, there was still a significant amount of policy-driven distortion in global agricultural product prices. The three agricultural products with the greatest amount of trade distortion were sugar, milk and rice, mainly due to taxation. Among the [[oilseed]]s, sesame had the greatest amount of taxation, but overall, feed grains and oilseeds had much lower levels of taxation than livestock products. Since the 1980s, policy-driven distortions have seen a greater decrease among livestock products than crops during the worldwide reforms in agricultural policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/4101/WPS4864.pdf?sequence=1|title=How Do Agricultural Policy Restrictions to Global Trade and Welfare Differ across Commodities?|author=Peter J.

== Energy and agriculture ==
Since the 1940s, agricultural productivity has increased dramatically, due largely to the increased use of energy-intensive mechanization, fertilizers and pesticides. The vast majority of this energy input comes from [[fossil fuel]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/world-oil-supplies-are-set-to-run-out-faster-than-expected-warn-scientists-453068.html World oil supplies are set to run out faster than expected, warn scientists]&quot;. ''The Independent''. 14 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Between the 1960–65 measuring cycle and the cycle from 1986 to 1990, the [[Green Revolution]] transformed agriculture around the globe, with world grain production increasing significantly (between 70% and 390% for wheat and 60% to 150% for rice, depending on geographic area)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Future of the Green Revolution: Implications for International Grain Markets|author=Robert W.

Modern or industrialized agriculture is dependent on fossil fuels in two fundamental ways: 1) direct consumption on the farm and 2) indirect consumption to manufacture inputs used on the farm. Direct consumption includes the use of lubricants and fuels to operate farm vehicles and machinery; and use of gasoline, liquid [[propane]], and electricity to power dryers, pumps, lights, heaters, and coolers. American farms directly consumed about 1.2 exajoules (1.1 quadrillion BTU) in 2002, or just over 1% of the nation's total energy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncseonline.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Schnepf, Randy|date=19 November 2004|title=Energy use in Agriculture: Background and Issues|work=CRS Report for Congress|url=http://www.nationalaglawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/crs/RL32677.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]]|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indirect consumption is mainly oil and [[natural gas]] used to manufacture fertilizers and pesticides, which accounted for 0.6 exajoules (0.6 quadrillion BTU) in 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncseonline.org&quot;/&gt; The natural gas and coal consumed by the production of [[nitrogen fertilizer]] can account for over half of the agricultural energy usage. China utilizes mostly coal in the production of nitrogen fertilizer, while most of Europe uses large amounts of natural gas and small amounts of coal. According to a 2010 report published by [[The Royal Society]], agriculture is increasingly dependent on the direct and indirect input of fossil fuels. Overall, the fuels used in agriculture vary based on several factors, including crop, production system and location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/365/1554/2991.full|title=Energy and the food system|author=Jeremy Woods, Adrian Williams, John K.

Together, direct and indirect consumption by US farms accounts for about 2% of the nation's energy use. Direct and indirect energy consumption by U.S. farms peaked in 1979, and has gradually declined over the past 30 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncseonline.org&quot;/&gt; [[Food systems]] encompass not just agricultural production, but also off-farm processing, packaging, transporting, marketing, consumption, and disposal of food and food-related items. Agriculture accounts for less than one-fifth of food system energy use in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;css.snre.umich.edu&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ers.usda.gov&quot;/&gt;

===Mitigation of effects of petroleum shortages===
[[Image:Hubbert peak oil plot.svg|right|thumb|250px|[[M. King Hubbert]]'s prediction of world petroleum production rates.

In the event of a petroleum shortage (see [[peak oil]] for global concerns), organic agriculture can be more attractive than conventional practices that use petroleum-based pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers.

==Policy==
{{Main|Agricultural policy}}
[[Agricultural policy]] is the set of government decisions and actions relating to domestic agriculture and imports of foreign agricultural products. Governments usually implement agricultural policies with the goal of achieving a specific outcome in the domestic agricultural product markets. Some overarching themes include risk management and adjustment (including policies related to climate change, [[food safety]] and natural disasters), [[economic stability]] (including policies related to taxes), natural resources and [[environmental sustainability]] (especially [[water resource management|water policy]]), research and development, and market access for domestic commodities (including relations with global organizations and agreements with other countries).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|page=13|title=Agricultural and food policy choices in Australia|journal=Sustainable agriculture and food policy in the 21st century: challenges and solutions|publisher=Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics – Bureau of Rural Sciences|date=October 2010|accessdate=22 April 2013|author=Lindsay Hogan and Paul Morris|url=http://adl.brs.gov.au/data/warehouse/pe_abarebrs99001749/CP10.15_Agric_food_policy_CONFERENCE_PAPER.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural policy can also touch on [[food quality]], ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality, [[food security]], ensuring that the food supply meets the population's needs, and [[Conservation biology|conservation]]. Policy programs can range from financial programs, such as subsidies, to encouraging producers to enroll in voluntary quality assurance programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/pol/agr/|title=Agriculture: Not Just Farming&amp;nbsp;... |publisher=European Union|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many influences on the creation of agricultural policy, including consumers, agribusiness, trade lobbies and other groups. [[Agribusiness]] interests hold a large amount of influence over policy making, in the form of [[lobbying]] and [[campaign contribution]]s. Political action groups, including those interested in environmental issues and [[labor union]]s, also provide influence, as do lobbying organizations representing individual agricultural commodities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://web.missouri.edu/ikerdj/papers/SFT-Corporatization%20of%20Fm%20Pol%20%289-10%29.htm|title=Corporatization of Agricultural Policy|author=Ikerd, John|journal=Small Farm Today Magazine|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) leads international efforts to defeat hunger and provides a forum for the negotiation of global agricultural regulations and agreements. Dr. Samuel Jutzi, director of FAO's animal production and health division, states that lobbying by large corporations has stopped reforms that would improve human health and the environment. For example, proposals in 2010 for a voluntary code of conduct for the livestock industry that would have provided incentives for improving standards for health, and environmental regulations, such as the number of animals an area of land can support without long-term damage, were successfully defeated due to large food company pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/sep/22/food-firms-lobbying-samuel-jutzi |title=Corporate Lobbying Is Blocking Food Reforms, Senior UN Official Warns: Farming Summit Told of Delaying Tactics by Large Agribusiness and Food Producers on Decisions that Would Improve Human Health and the Environment |location=London |first=Juliette |last=Jowit |date= 22 September 2010 |newspaper= The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aldous Leonard Huxley''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ʌ|k|s|l|i}} (26 July 1894 – 22 November 1963) was an English writer and a prominent member of the [[Huxley family]]. Best known for his novels including ''[[Brave New World]]'', set in a [[dystopian]] London, ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'', which recalls experiences when taking a psychedelic drug, and a wide-ranging output of essays. Huxley also edited the magazine ''[[Oxford Poetry]]'', and published short stories, poetry, travel writing, film stories and scripts. He spent the later part of his life in the United States, living in Los Angeles from 1937 until his death.

Huxley was a [[Humanism|humanist]], [[pacifist]], and [[Satire|satirist]]. He became deeply concerned that human beings might become subjugated through the sophisticated use of the mass media or mood-altering drugs, or tragically impacted by misunderstanding or the misapplication of increasingly sophisticated technology.

Huxley later became interested in spiritual subjects such as [[parapsychology]] and philosophical [[mysticism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Thody| first = Philipe| title = Huxley: A Biographical Introduction| year = 1973| publisher = Scribner| isbn = 978-0-289-70188-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = David K.

By the end of his life Huxley was widely acknowledged as one of the pre-eminent intellectuals of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Thody, Philipe (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
{{See also|Huxley family}}

Aldous Huxley was born in [[Godalming]], Surrey, England, in 1894. He was the third son of the writer and schoolmaster [[Leonard Huxley (writer)|Leonard Huxley]] and his first wife, [[Julia Arnold]], who founded [[Prior's Field School]]. Julia was the niece of poet and critic [[Matthew Arnold]] and the sister of [[Mary Augusta Ward|Mrs. Humphrey Ward]]. Aldous was the grandson of [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], the [[zoologist]], agnostic and controversialist (&quot;Darwin's Bulldog&quot;). His brother [[Julian Huxley]] and half-brother [[Andrew Huxley]] also became outstanding biologists. Aldous had another brother, Noel Trevelyan Huxley (1891–1914), who committed suicide after a period of [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Charles Mason (1978) ''Aldous Huxley and the Way to Reality.'' Greenwood Press, 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;5&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley began his learning in his father's well-equipped botanical laboratory, then went to [[Hillside School, Malvern]]. His teacher was his mother, who supervised him for several years until she became terminally ill. After Hillside, he was educated at [[Eton College]]. Huxley's mother died in 1908 when he was 14. In 1911, he suffered an illness ([[Keratitis|keratitis punctata]]) which &quot;left [him] practically blind for two to three years&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huxley|first=Aldous|year=1939|chapter=biography and bibliography (appendix)|title=After Many A Summer Dies The Swan (1st Perennial Classic Ed.)|page=243|publisher=Harper &amp; Row, Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aldous volunteered to join the army at the outbreak of the [[First World War]], but was rejected on health grounds: he was half-blind in one eye. Once his eyesight recovered sufficiently, he was able to study English literature at [[Balliol College, Oxford]]. In 1916 he edited ''[[Oxford Poetry]]'' and later graduated (B.A.) with first class honours. His brother Julian wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;I believe his blindness was a blessing in disguise. For one thing, it put paid to his idea of taking up medicine as a career&amp;nbsp;... His uniqueness lay in his universalism. He was able to take all knowledge for his province.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Huxley 1965. ''Aldous Huxley 1894–1963: a Memorial Volume''. Chatto &amp; Windus, London. p.&amp;nbsp;22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following his education at Balliol, Huxley was financially indebted to his father and had to earn a living. He taught French for a year at [[Eton College|Eton]], where [[Eric Blair]] (later to become [[George Orwell]]) and [[Steven Runciman]] were among his pupils, but was remembered as an incompetent and hopeless teacher who couldn't keep discipline. Nevertheless, Blair and others were impressed by his use of words.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crick&quot;&gt;
{{cite book| last = Crick| first = Bernard| title = George Orwell: A Life| year = 1992| publisher = Penguin Books| location = London| isbn = 978-0-14-014563-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For a short while in 1918, he was employed acquiring provisions at the [[Air Ministry]].

Significantly, Huxley also worked for a time in the 1920s at the technologically advanced [[Brunner Mond|Brunner and Mond]] chemical plant in [[Billingham]], Teesside, and the most recent introduction to his famous science fiction novel ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1932) states that this experience of &quot;an ordered universe in a world of planless incoherence&quot; was one source for the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Baggini| first = Julian| title = Atheism| url = http://books.google.com/?id=DUal7eYmEnEC&amp;pg=PA86| year = 2009| publisher = Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.| isbn = 978-1-4027-6882-8| page = 86 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Huxley-Arnold family tree}}

==Career==
Huxley completed his first (unpublished) novel at the age of 17 and began writing seriously in his early 20s. His first published novels were social satires, beginning with ''[[Crome Yellow]]'' (1921).

=== Bloomsbury set ===
[[File:SomeBloomsburymembers.jpg|thumb|right|Left to right: [[Bloomsbury Group]] members – [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]], Maria Nys, [[Lytton Strachey]], [[Duncan Grant]], and [[Vanessa Bell]].]]
During the First World War, Huxley spent much of his time at [[Garsington Manor]], home of Lady [[Ottoline Morrell]], working as a farm labourer. Here he met several [[Bloomsbury Group|Bloomsbury]] figures including [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Clive Bell]]. Later, in ''[[Crome Yellow]]'' (1921) he caricatured the Garsington lifestyle. Jobs were very scarce, but in 1919 Middleton Murray was reorganising the [[Athenaeum (magazine)|Athenaeum]] and invited Huxley to join the staff. He accepted immediately, and quickly married the Belgian refugee Maria Nys, also at Garsington.&lt;ref&gt;''The Huxleys'', Ronald W. Clark, William Heinemann Ltd, London, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; They lived with their young son in Italy part of the time in the 1920s, where Huxley would visit his friend [[D. H. Lawrence]]. Following Lawrence's death in 1930, Huxley edited Lawrence's letters (1933).

Works of this period included important novels on the dehumanising aspects of scientific progress, most famously ''[[Brave New World]]'', and on pacifist themes (for example, ''[[Eyeless in Gaza]]''). In ''Brave New World'' Huxley portrays a society operating on the principles of mass production and [[Pavlovian conditioning]]. Huxley was strongly influenced by [[F. Matthias Alexander]] and included him as a character in ''Eyeless in Gaza''.

Starting from this period, Huxley began to write and edit non-fiction works on pacifist issues, including ''[[Ends and Means]]'', ''An Encyclopedia of Pacifism'', and ''Pacifism and Philosophy'', and was an active member of the [[Peace Pledge Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/people/huxley.html |publisher=Peace Pledge Union |title=Aldous Huxley|accessdate=15 May 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110606072731/http://www.ppu.org.uk/people/huxley.html| archivedate= 6 June 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
In 1937, Huxley moved to Hollywood, with his wife Maria, son Matthew, and friend [[Gerald Heard]]. He lived in the US, mainly in southern California, until his death, but also for a time in [[Taos, New Mexico]], where he wrote ''[[Ends and Means]]'' (published in 1937). In this work he examines the fact that although most people in modern civilisation agree that they want a world of &quot;liberty, peace, justice, and brotherly love&quot;, they have not been able to agree on how to achieve it.

Heard introduced Huxley to [[Vedanta]] ([[Upanishads|Upanishad-centered philosophy]]), meditation, and vegetarianism through the principle of [[ahimsa]]. In 1938 Huxley befriended [[J. Krishnamurti]], whose teachings he greatly admired. He also became a Vedantist in the circle of Hindu [[Swami]] [[Swami Prabhavananda|Prabhavananda]], and introduced [[Christopher Isherwood]] to this circle. Not long after, Huxley wrote his book on widely held spiritual values and ideas, ''[[The Perennial Philosophy]]'', which discussed the teachings of renowned mystics of the world. Huxley's book affirmed a sensibility that insists there are realities beyond the generally accepted &quot;five senses&quot; and that there is genuine meaning for humans beyond both sensual satisfactions and sentimentalities.

Huxley became a close friend of Remsen Bird, president of [[Occidental College]]. He spent much time at the college, which is in the [[Eagle Rock, Los Angeles|Eagle Rock]] neighbourhood of Los Angeles. The college appears as &quot;Tarzana College&quot; in his satirical novel ''[[After Many a Summer]]'' (1939). The novel won Huxley that year's [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Haugrud Reiff, Raychel (2003) ''Aldous Huxley: Brave New World'' p.103. Marshall Cavendish, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley also incorporated Bird into the novel.

During this period Huxley earned some Hollywood income as a writer. In March 1938, his friend [[Anita Loos]], a novelist and screenwriter, put him in touch with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] who hired Huxley for ''[[Madame Curie (1943 film)|Madame Curie]]'' which was originally to star [[Greta Garbo]] and be directed by [[George Cukor]]. (The film was eventually completed by MGM in 1943 with a different director and cast.) Huxley received screen credit for ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)|Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1940) and was paid for his work on a number of other films, including ''[[Jane Eyre (1944 film)|Jane Eyre]]'' (1944).

However, his success in Hollywood was minimal. When he wrote a synopsis of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', [[Walt Disney]] rejected it on the grounds that &quot;he could only understand every third word&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Huxleys p. 295&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last = Clark |first = Ronald William |title=The Huxleys |year=1968 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location = New York |page=295 |isbn = 978-0-434-13580-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley's leisurely development of ideas, it seemed, was not suitable for the movie moguls, who demanded fast, dynamic dialogue above all else. For Dick Huemer, during the 1940s, Huxley went to the first of a five meetings' session to elaborate the script of ''Alice in Wonderland'' but never came again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mouse Under Glass p82&quot;&gt;David Koenig, ''Mouse Under Glass'', p.82&lt;/ref&gt; For author John Grant, although the movie's character the Caterpillar displays some characteristics familiar from Huxley's discussion of his experiments with [[hallucinogens]], Huxley's contribution to the movie is nonexistent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Animated Characters 233&quot;&gt;John Grant, ''The Encyclopedia of Walt Disney's Animated Characters'', p.233.&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley wrote an introduction to the posthumous publication of J.D. Unwin's 1940 book ''Hopousia or The Sexual and Economic Foundations of a New Society''.&lt;ref&gt;J.D. Unwin, ''Hopousia OR The Sexual and Economic Foundations of a New Society'' (1940), Oscar Piest, NY&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 October 1949, Huxley wrote to [[George Orwell]], author of ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', congratulating him on &quot;how fine and how profoundly important the book is&quot;. In his letter to Orwell, he predicted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Within the next generation I believe that the world's leaders will discover that infant conditioning and narco-hypnosis are more efficient, as instruments of government, than clubs and prisons, and that the lust for power can be just as completely satisfied by suggesting people into loving their servitude as by flogging them and kicking them into obedience.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last = Huxley |first = Aldous |editor = Grover Smith |title=Letters of Aldous Huxley |year=1969 |publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus |location = London |isbn= 978-0-7011-1312-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Huxley had deeply felt apprehensions about the future the developed world might make for itself. From these he put forward some warnings in his writings and talks. In a 1958 televised interview conducted by journalist [[Mike Wallace]], Huxley outlined several major concerns: the difficulties and dangers of world overpopulation; the tendency toward distinctly hierarchical social organisation; the crucial importance of evaluating the use of technology in mass societies susceptible to wily persuasion; the tendency to promote modern politicians, to a naive public, as well-marketed commodities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePNGa0m3XA |title=The Mike Wallace Interview: Aldous Huxley (18 May 1958) |publisher=YouTube |date=25 July 2011 |accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post World War II ===
After the Second World War, Huxley applied for United States citizenship. His application was continuously deferred on the grounds that he would not say he would take up arms to defend the US He claimed a philosophical, rather than a religious objection, and therefore was not exempt under the [[McCarran Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.charlestonvt.com/Holly/BCL/MCV%20Aldous%20Huxley/Originals/Derbyshire_WhatHappened.ORG.pdf|title=What Happened to Aldous Huxley?|author=J Derbyshire|publisher=The New Criterion|year=2003|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He withdrew his application. Nevertheless, he remained in the country; and in 1959 he turned down an offer of a [[Knight Bachelor]] by the [[Harold Macmillan#Prime Minister (1957–1963)|Macmillan government]]. During the 1950s, Huxley's interest in the field of [[psychical research]] grew keener, and his later works are strongly influenced by both [[mysticism]] and his experiences with [[psychedelic drug]]s.

In October 1930, the English occultist [[Aleister Crowley]] had dined with Huxley in [[Berlin]], and to this day rumours persist that Crowley introduced Huxley to [[peyote]] on that occasion.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} He was introduced to [[mescaline]] (the key active ingredient of peyote) by the psychiatrist [[Humphry Osmond]] in 1953, taking it for the first time in the afternoon of 5 May.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Douglas. Friday, 22 August 2008 &quot;Humphry Osmond, 86, Who Sought Medicinal Value in Psychedelic Drugs, Dies&quot;. New York: ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; Through Dr. Osmond, Huxley met millionaire [[Alfred Matthew Hubbard]], who was by this point introducing creative and influential people to [[LSD]] on a wide-ranging basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Stevens| first = Jay| title = Storming heaven: LSD and the American dream| url = http://books.google.com/?id=WWmAE3kiNzsC&amp;pg=PA47| year = 1987| publisher = Grove Press| isbn = 978-0-8021-3587-2| id = ISBN 0802135870| pages = 47–64| year=1998 |publisher=Grove Press |quote=All sorts of crazy things started happening... }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 December 1955, Huxley took his first dose of LSD. Indeed, Huxley was a pioneer of self-directed psychedelic drug use &quot;in a search for enlightenment&quot;. According to a letter written by his wife Laura, Huxley requested and received two intramuscular injections of 100 micrograms of LSD as he lay dying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2010/03/most-beautiful-death.html|title=Letters of Note: The most beautiful death |date=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His psychedelic drug experiences are described in the essays ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'' (the title deriving from some lines in the book ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'' by [[William Blake]]), and ''[[Heaven and Hell (essay)|Heaven and Hell]]''. Some of his writings on psychedelics became frequent reading among early [[hippies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Cain| first = Chelsea| title = The Hippie Handbook: How to Tie-Dye a T-Shirt, Flash a Peace Sign, and Other Essential Skills for the Carefree Life| year = 2004| publisher = Chronicle Books| isbn = 978-0-8118-4320-1| page = 167 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While living in Los Angeles, Huxley was a friend of [[Ray Bradbury]]. According to Sam Weller's biography of Bradbury, the latter was dissatisfied with Huxley, especially after Huxley encouraged Bradbury to take psychedelic drugs.

== Association with Vedanta ==
Beginning in 1939 and continuing until his death in 1963, Huxley had an extensive association with the [[Vedanta Society of Southern California]], founded and headed by [[Swami Prabhavananda]]. Together with [[Gerald Heard]], [[Christopher Isherwood]], and other followers he was initiated by the Swami and was taught meditation and spiritual practices.{{sfn|Roy|2003}}

In 1944 Huxley wrote the introduction to the &quot;Bhagavad Gita: The Song of God&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;IsherwoodSwami Prabhavananda1987&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Isherwood| first1 = Christopher| last2 = Swami Prabhavananda| last3 = Aldous| first3 = Huxley| title = Bhagavad Gita: The Song of God| year = 1987| publisher = Vedanta Press| location = Hollywood, Calif| isbn = 978-0-87481-043-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; translated by Swami Prabhavanada and Christopher Isherwood, which was published by The Vedanta Society of Southern California.

From 1941 through 1960 Huxley contributed 48 articles to ''Vedanta and the West'', published by the Society. He also served on the editorial board with Isherwood, Heard, and playwright John van Druten from 1951 through 1962.

Huxley also occasionally lectured at the Hollywood and Santa Barbara Vedanta temples. Two of those lectures have been released on CD: ''Knowledge and Understanding'' and ''Who Are We'' from 1955.

After the publication of ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'', Huxley and the Swami disagreed about the meaning and importance of the LSD drug experience, which may have caused the relationship to cool, but Huxley continued to write articles for the Society's journal, lecture at the temple, and attend social functions.

== Eyesight ==
With respect to details about the true quality of Huxley's eyesight at specific points in his life, there are differing accounts. Around 1939, Huxley encountered the [[Bates Method]] for better eyesight, and a teacher, [[Margaret Corbett]], who was able to teach him in the method. In 1940, Huxley relocated from Hollywood to a {{convert|40|acre|ha|adj=on}} ''ranchito'' in the high desert hamlet of [[Llano, California]], in northernmost Los Angeles County. Huxley then said that his sight improved dramatically with the Bates Method and the extreme and pure natural lighting of the southwestern American desert. He reported that for the first time in over 25 years, he was able to read without glasses and without strain. He even tried driving a car along the dirt road beside the ranch. He wrote a book about his successes with the Bates Method, ''[[The Art of Seeing]]'', which was published in 1942 (US), 1943 (UK). It was from this period, with the publication of the generally disputed theories contained in the latter book, that a growing degree of popular controversy arose over the subject of Huxley's eyesight.

It was, and to a noticeable extent still is, widely held that, for most of his life, since the illness in his teens which left Huxley nearly blind, that his eyesight was exceedingly poor (despite the partial recovery which had enabled him to study at Oxford). For instance, some ten years after publication of ''The Art of Seeing'', in 1952, [[Bennett Cerf]] was present when Huxley spoke at a Hollywood banquet, wearing no glasses and apparently reading his paper from the lectern without difficulty: &quot;Then suddenly he faltered—and the disturbing truth became obvious. He wasn't reading his address at all. He had learned it by heart. To refresh his memory he brought the paper closer and closer to his eyes. When it was only an inch or so away he still couldn't read it, and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him. It was an agonising moment.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardner&quot;&gt;From Bennet Cerf’s column in ''The Saturday Review'', 12 April 1952, quoted in
{{cite book| last = Gardner| first = Martin| authorlink = Martin Gardner| title = [[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]| year = 1957| publisher = Dover Publications| isbn = 978-0-486-20394-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Huxley's second wife, [[Laura Archera Huxley]], would later emphasise in her biographical account, ''This Timeless Moment'': &quot;One of the great achievements of his life: that of having regained his sight.&quot; After revealing a letter she wrote to the ''Los Angeles Times'' disclaiming the label of Huxley as a &quot;poor fellow who can hardly see&quot; by [[Walter C. Alvarez]], she tempers this: &quot;Although I feel it was an injustice to treat Aldous as though he were blind, it is true there were many indications of his impaired vision. For instance, although Aldous did not wear glasses, he would quite often use a magnifying lens.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Huxley&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Huxley| first = Laura| title = This Timeless Moment| year = 1968| publisher = Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux| location = New York| isbn = 978-0-89087-968-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Laura Huxley proceeds to elaborate a few nuances of inconsistency peculiar to Huxley's vision. Her account, in this respect, is discernibly congruent with the following sample of Huxley's own words from ''The Art of Seeing''. &quot;The most characteristic fact about the functioning of the total organism, or any part of the organism, is that it is not constant, but highly variable.&quot; Nevertheless, the topic of Huxley's eyesight continues to endure similar, significant controversy, regardless of how trivial a subject matter it might initially appear.&lt;ref&gt;Rolfe, Lionel (1981) ''Literary L.A.'' p.50. Chronicle Books, 1981. University of California&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He married Maria Nys (10 September 1899 – 12 February 1955), a Belgian he met at Garsington, in 1919. They had one child, [[Matthew Huxley]] (19 April 1920 – 10 February 2005), who had a career as an author, anthropologist, and prominent [[epidemiology|epidemiologist]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A31009-2005Feb16.html &quot;Author, NIMH Epidemiologist Matthew Huxley Dies at 84&quot;.] 17 February 2005 ''[[Washington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, Maria died of breast cancer.

In 1956 he married [[Laura Huxley|Laura Archera]] (1911–2007), also an author. She wrote ''This Timeless Moment'', a biography of Huxley. Laura felt inspired to illuminate the story of their provocative marriage through Mary Ann Braubach's 2010 documentary, &quot;Huxley on Huxley&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://huxleyonhuxley.com/about/synopsis/ |title= Huxley on Huxley. |others= Dir. Mary Ann Braubach. Cinedigm, 2010. DVD.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960 Aldous Huxley was diagnosed with [[laryngeal cancer]], and in the years that followed, with his health deteriorating, he wrote the Utopian novel ''[[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bowering ''Aldous Huxley: A Study of the Major Novels'', p. 197, Oxford University Press, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; and gave lectures on &quot;Human Potentialities&quot; at the [[Esalen Institute]], which were fundamental to the forming of the [[Human Potential Movement]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Despite his interest in spirituality and mysticism, Huxley called himself an agnostic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Aldous Huxley| year = 2003| publisher = Infobase Publishing| isbn = 978-0-7910-7040-6| page = 27| quote = As late as 1962 he wrote to Reid Gardner, &quot;I remain an agnostic who aspires to be a gnostic&quot; (Letters 935).| editor = Harold Bloom }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most substantial collection of Huxley's few remaining papers (following the destruction of most in a fire) is at the Library of the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt1489q14s/ |title= Finding Aid for the Aldous and Laura Huxley papers, 1925–2007 |publisher= Special Collections, [[Charles E. Young Research Library]], UCLA |accessdate= 4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some are also at the [[Stanford University]] Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://findingaids.stanford.edu/xtf/view?docId=ead/mss/m0107.xml |title= Guide to the Aldous Huxley Collection, 1922–1934 |publisher= Dept. of Special Collections and University Archives |accessdate= 4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
On his deathbed, unable to speak, Huxley made a written request to his wife Laura for &quot;LSD, 100 µg, intramuscular&quot;. According to her account of his death&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2010/03/most-beautiful-death.html |title=Account of Huxley's death on Letters of Note |publisher=Lettersofnote.com |date=25 March 2010 |accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''This Timeless Moment'', she obliged with an injection at 11:45&amp;nbsp;am and a second one a few hours later; Huxley died aged 69, at 5:20&amp;nbsp;pm on 22 November 1963.
Media coverage of Huxley's passing was overshadowed by the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination of President John F. Kennedy]], on the same day, as was the death of the British author [[C. S. Lewis]], who also died on 22 November. This coincidence was the inspiration for [[Peter Kreeft]]'s book ''[[Between Heaven and Hell (novel)|Between Heaven and Hell: A Dialog Somewhere Beyond Death with John F. Kennedy, C. S. Lewis, &amp; Aldous Huxley]]''.

Huxley's ashes were interred in the family grave at the Watts Cemetery, home of the [[Watts Mortuary Chapel]] in Compton, a village near [[Guildford]], Surrey, England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|8707127}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 July 2013 a commemorative bench was unveiled there, donated by the Aldous and Laura Huxley Literary Trust and the International Aldous Huxley Society.

Huxley had been a long-time friend of famous Russian composer [[Igor Stravinsky]], who later dedicated his last orchestral composition to Huxley. Stravinsky began 'Variations' in Santa Fé, New Mexico in July 1963, and completed the composition in Hollywood on 28 October 1964. It was first performed in Chicago on 17 April 1965, by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra conducted by Robert Craft (Spies 1965, 62; White 1979, 534). The score is dedicated to the memory of Stravinsky's close friend Aldous Huxley, who died on 22 November 1963, when composition of the Variations was in progress (White 1979, 536–37).

Although not composed for the purpose, Stravinsky's music was twice choreographed for the New York City Ballet by George Balanchine, a first version in 1966, and a second version in 1982, both times under the title &quot;Variations&quot; (Barnes 1966; Anderson 1982).

Huxley's literary legacy continues to be represented by the literary agency headed by [[Georges Borchardt]].

These types include the endosymbiotic events of [[cyanobacteria]], [[red algae]] and [[green algae]], leading to the hypothesis of the supergroups [[Archaeplastida]], [[Chromalveolata]] and [[Cabozoa]] respectively. However, the monophyly of Cabozoa has been refuted and the monophylies of Archaeplastida and Chromalveolata are currently strongly challenged.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Endosymbiotic events are noted by dotted lines.]]

'''Algae''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|dʒ|iː}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|ɡ|iː}}; singular ''alga'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|ɡ|ə}}, [[Latin language|Latin]] for &quot;seaweed&quot;) are a very large and diverse group of simple, typically [[autotrophic]] organisms, ranging from [[unicellular]] to [[multicellular]] forms, such as the [[Macrocystis pyrifera|giant kelp]] (large brown alga), that may grow up to 50&amp;nbsp;meters in length. Most are [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] and &quot;simple&quot; because they lack many of the distinct cell [[organelles]]{{which|date=March 2014}} and cell types found in [[embryophyte|land plants]]. The largest and most complex marine forms are called [[seaweed]]s.

There is no clear definition of algae. One definition is that algae &quot;have chlorophyll as a their primary photosynthetic pigment and lack a sterile covering of cells around their reproductive cells&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lee, R. E. |year=2008 |title=Phycology |publisher=Cambridge University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors exclude all prokaryotes&lt;ref name=&quot;IntroBot&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Nabors| first = Murray W.| title = Introduction to Botany| year = 2004| publisher = Pearson Education, Inc| location = San Francisco, CA| isbn = 978-0-8053-4416-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus do not consider [[cyanobacteria]] (blue-green algae) as algae.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allaby 92&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Allaby|first=M ed.|year=1992|encyclopedia=The Concise Dictionary of Botany|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|title=Algae}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algae constitute a [[polyphyletic]] group&lt;ref name=&quot;IntroBot&quot;/&gt; since they do not include a common ancestor, and although their plastids seem to have a single origin, from [[cyanobacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;keeling&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title = Diversity and evolutionary history of plastids and their hosts | author = Patrick J.

Algae exhibit a wide range of reproductive strategies, from simple [[asexual reproduction|asexual]] cell division to complex forms of [[sexual reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History; Department of Botany. http://botany.si.edu/projects/algae/introduction.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Algae lack the various structures that characterize land plants, such as the phyllids (leaf-like structures) of [[bryophytes]], [[rhizoid]]s in [[nonvascular plants]], and the [[root]]s, [[leaf|leaves]], and other [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] that are found in [[tracheophyte]]s ([[vascular plants]]). Most are [[phototroph]]ic, although some groups contain members that are [[mixotroph]]ic, deriving energy both from photosynthesis and uptake of organic carbon either by [[osmotrophy]], [[myzocytosis|myzotrophy]], or [[phagocytosis|phagotrophy]]. Some unicellular [[species]] such as the green algae ''[[Prototheca]]'' and ''[[Helicosporidium]]'', and many [[euglenids]] and [[dinoflagellates]], have become [[heterotroph]]s, sometimes parasitic, relying entirely on external energy sources and have limited or no photosynthetic apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tartar, A., Boucias, D. G., Becnel, J. J., and Adams, B.

Algae have photosynthetic machinery ultimately derived from [[cyanobacteria]] that produce [[oxygen]] as a by-product of photosynthesis, unlike other photosynthetic bacteria such as [[Purple sulfur bacteria|purple]] and [[green sulfur bacteria]]. Fossilized filamentous algae from the [[Vindhya]] basin have been dated back to 1.6 to 1.7 billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19416859|year=2009|last1=Bengtson|first1=S|last2=Belivanova|first2=V|last3=Rasmussen|first3=B|last4=Whitehouse|first4=M|title=The controversial &quot;Cambrian&quot; fossils of the Vindhyan are real but more than a billion years older|volume=106|issue=19|pages=7729–34|doi=10.1073/pnas.0812460106|pmc=2683128|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and study==
[[File:Gmelin - Historia Fucorum (Titelblatt).png|thumb|left|190px|Title page of [[Samuel Gottlieb Gmelin]], ''Historia Fucorum'', dated 1768.]] The singular ''alga'' is the Latin word for a particular seaweed and retains that meaning in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=alga, algae|encyclopedia=Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged with Seven Language Dictionary|volume=1|year=1986|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[etymology]] is obscure. Although some speculate that it is related to Latin ''algēre'', &quot;be cold&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Eric|last=Partridge|title=algae|encyclopedia=Origins|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is no known reason to associate seaweed with temperature. A more likely source is ''alliga'', &quot;binding, entwining.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=alga|first=Charlton T.|last=Lewis|author2=Charles Short|location=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1879|isbn=978-0-19-864201-5|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?layout.reflang=la;layout.refdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059;layout.reflookup=Alga;layout.refcit=;doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%231812}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Greek]] word for seaweed was ''φῦκος'' (fūkos or phykos), which could mean either the seaweed (probably red algae) or a red dye derived from it. The Latinization, ''fūcus'', meant primarily the cosmetic rouge. The etymology is uncertain, but a strong candidate has long been some word related to the Biblical ''פוך'' (pūk), &quot;paint&quot; (if not that word itself), a cosmetic eye-shadow used by the ancient Egyptians and other inhabitants of the eastern Mediterranean. It could be any color: black, red, green, blue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Thomas Kelly Cheyne|author2= John Sutherland Black| title = Encyclopædia biblica: a critical dictionary of the literary, political and religious history, the archæology, geography, and natural history of the Bible| url = http://books.google.com/?id=GccVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA3525| year = 1902| publisher = Macmillan Company| isbn = | page = 3525 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly the modern study of marine and freshwater algae is called either [[phycology]] or algology, depending on whether the Greek or Latin root is used. The name ''Fucus'' appears in a number of [[taxon|taxa]].

==Classification==
[[File:Gephyrocapsa oceanica color.jpg|thumb|300px|False-color [[Scanning electron micrograph]] of the unicellular [[coccolithophore]] ''[[Gephyrocapsa]] oceanica''.]]

Most algae except cyanobacteria contain chloroplasts. Chloroplasts contain circular [[DNA]] and are similar in structure to cyanobacteria, presumably representing reduced cyanobacterial [[endosymbiotic theory|endosymbionts]]. The exact nature of the chloroplasts is different among separate lineages of algae, reflecting different endosymbiotic events. The table below describes the composition of the three major groups of algae. Their lineage relationships are shown in the figure in the upper right. Many of these groups contain some members that are no longer photosynthetic. Some retain [[plastid]]s, but not chloroplasts, while others have lost plastids entirely.

|These algae have ''primary'' [[chloroplast]]s, i.e. the chloroplasts are surrounded by ''two membranes'' and probably developed through a single endosymbiotic event. The chloroplasts of red algae have [[chlorophyll]]s ''a'' and ''c'' (often), and [[phycobilin]]s, while those of green algae have chloroplasts with chlorophyll ''a'' and ''b''. Higher plants are pigmented similarly to green algae and probably developed from them, and thus [[Chlorophyta]] is a sister [[taxon]] to the plants; sometimes they are grouped as [[Viridiplantae]].

'''Chlorarachniophytes''', which belong to the phylum [[Cercozoa]], contain a small [[nucleomorph]], which is a [[relict]] of the algae's [[cell nucleus|nucleus]].

'''Euglenids''', which belong to the phylum [[Euglenozoa]], live primarily in freshwater and have chloroplasts with only three membranes. It has been suggested that the endosymbiotic green algae were acquired through [[myzocytosis]] rather than [[phagocytosis]].

These groups have chloroplasts containing chlorophylls ''a'' and ''c'', and phycobilins.The shape varies from plant to plant. they may be of discoid, plate-like, reticulate, cup-shaped, spiral or ribbon shaped. They have one or more pyrenoids to preserve protein and starch. The latter chlorophyll type is not known from any prokaryotes or primary chloroplasts, but genetic similarities with red algae suggest a relationship there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Janson|first=Sven|author2=Graneli, Edna|title=Genetic analysis of the psbA gene from single cells indicates a cryptomonad origin of the plastid in Dinophysis (Dinophyceae)|journal=Phycologia|date=September 2003|volume=42|issue=5|pages=473–477|publisher=Allen Press Publishing Services|issn=00318884|doi=10.2216/i0031-8884-42-5-473.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first three of these groups ('''Chromista'''), the chloroplast has four membranes, retaining a [[nucleomorph]] in [[Cryptomonad]]s, and they likely share a common pigmented ancestor, although other evidence casts doubt on whether the [[Heterokonts]], [[Haptophyta]], and [[Cryptomonad]]s are in fact more closely related to each other than to other groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;parfrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title = Evaluating Support for the Current Classification of Eukaryotic Diversity | author = Laura Wegener Parfrey, Erika Barbero, Elyse Lasser, Micah Dunthorn, Debashish Bhattacharya, David J Patterson, and Laura A Katz | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.0020220 | journal = PLoS Genet. |date=December 2006| volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = e220 | pmid = 17194223 | pmc = 1713255 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Burki F, Shalchian-Tabrizi K, Minge M, Skjæveland Å, Nikolaev SI, et al. | year = 2007 | title = Phylogenomics Reshuffles the Eukaryotic Supergroups | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 2 | issue = 8: e790 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0000790 | pages = e790 | pmid = 17726520 | pmc = 1949142 | editor1-last = Butler | editor1-first = Geraldine|bibcode = 2007PLoSO...2..790B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[W.H.Harvey]] (1811—1866) was the first to divide algae into four divisions based on their pigmentation. This is the first use of a biochemical criterion in plant systematics. Harvey's four divisions are: red algae (Rhodophyta), brown algae (Heteromontophyta), green algae (Chlorophyta) and Diatomaceae.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dixon 73&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Dixon| first = P S| title = Biology of the Rhodophyta| year = 1973| publisher = Oliver &amp; Boyd| location = Edinburgh| isbn = 978-0-05-002485-0| page = 232 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to higher plants==
The first plants on earth probably evolved from shallow freshwater algae much like ''[[Chara (alga)|Chara]]'' almost 500 million years ago. These probably had an isomorphic [[alternation of generations]] and were probably filamentous. Fossils of isolated land plant spores suggest land plants may have been around as long as 475 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = When plants conquered land | author = Ivan Noble | date = 18 September 2003 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3117034.stm | publisher = BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wellman2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Most of the simpler algae are [[unicellular]] [[flagellate]]s or [[amoeboid]]s, but colonial and non-motile forms have developed independently among several of the groups. Some of the more common organizational levels, more than one of which may occur in the [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] of a species, are
* ''[[Colony (biology)|Colonial]]'': small, regular groups of motile cells
* ''Capsoid'': individual non-motile cells embedded in [[mucilage]]
* ''Coccoid'': individual non-motile cells with cell walls
* ''Palmelloid'': non-motile cells embedded in mucilage
* ''Filamentous'': a string of non-motile cells connected together, sometimes branching
* ''Parenchymatous'': cells forming a [[thallus (tissue)|thallus]] with partial differentiation of tissues

The point where these non-algal plants begin and algae stop is usually taken to be the presence of reproductive organs with protective cell layers, a characteristic not found in the other alga groups.

==Physiology==
Many algae, particularly members of the [[Characeae]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Tazawa| first = Masashi| title = Sixty Years Research with Characean Cells: Fascinating Material for Plant Cell Biology| url = http://books.google.com/?id=iMxH0-q42PkC&amp;pg=PA31| accessdate = 7 October 2012| volume = 72| year = 2010| publisher = Springer| isbn = 978-3-642-13145-5| pages = 5–34| journal = Progress in Botany| doi = 10.1007/978-3-642-13145-5_1| series = Progress in Botany }}&lt;/ref&gt; have served as model experimental organisms to understand the mechanisms of the water permeability of membranes, [[osmoregulation]], [[turgor regulation]], [[salt tolerance]], [[cytoplasmic streaming]], and the generation of [[action potentials]].

[[Phytohormone]]s are found not only in higher plants, but in algae too.&lt;ref&gt;[Tarakhovskaya, E. R.; Maslov, Yu, I.; Shishova, M. F., 200: Phytohormones in algae. Russian Journal of Plant Physiology 54(2): 163–170]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbiotic algae==
Some species of algae form [[symbiosis|symbiotic relationships]] with other organisms. In these [[symbioses]], the algae supply photosynthates (organic substances) to the host organism providing protection to the algal cells. The host organism derives some or all of its energy requirements from the algae. Examples are as follows.

===Lichens===
{{Main|Lichens}}
[[File:Lichens near Clogher Head (stevefe).jpg|thumb|left|Rock lichens in Ireland.]]''[[Lichen]]s'' are defined by the International Association for Lichenology to be &quot;an association of a fungus and a photosynthetic [[symbiont]] resulting in a stable vegetative body having a specific structure.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Brodo| first = Irwin M| last2 = Sharnoff| first2 = Sylvia Duran| last3 = Sharnoff| first3 = Stephen| last4 = Laurie-Bourque| first4 = Susan| title = Lichens of North America| year = 2001| publisher = Yale University Press| location = New Haven| isbn = 978-0-300-08249-4| page = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fungi, or mycobionts, are mainly from the [[Ascomycota]] with a few from the [[Basidiomycota]]. They are not found alone in nature but when they began to associate is not known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Pearson| first = Lorentz C| title = The Diversity and Evolution of Plants| year = 1995| publisher = CRC Press| isbn = 978-0-8493-2483-3| page = 221 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One mycobiont associates with the same phycobiont species, rarely two, from the [[green algae]], except that alternatively the mycobiont may associate with a species of [[cyanobacteria]] (hence &quot;photobiont&quot; is the more accurate term). A photobiont may be associated with many different mycobionts or may live independently; accordingly, lichens are named and classified as fungal species.&lt;ref&gt;Brodo et al. (2001), page 6: &quot;A species of lichen collected anywhere in its range has the same lichen-forming fungus and, generally, the same photobiont. (A particular photobiont, on the other hand, may associate with scores of different lichen fungi).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The association is termed a morphogenesis because the lichen has a form and capabilities not possessed by the symbiont species alone (they can be experimentally isolated). It is possible that the photobiont triggers otherwise latent genes in the mycobiont.&lt;ref&gt;Brodo et al. (2001), page 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coral reefs===
{{Main|Coral|Coral reef|Symbiodinium}}
[[File:Coral Reef.jpg|thumb|left|Floridian coral reef]] [[Coral reef]]s are accumulated from the [[calcareous]] [[exoskeleton]]s of [[marine invertebrate]]s of the order [[Scleractinia]] (stony [[coral]]s). As [[Animal#Food and energy sourcing|animals]] they [[Metabolism|metabolize]] [[Sugar#Chemistry|sugar]] and [[oxygen]] to obtain energy for their cell-building processes, including [[secretion]] of the exoskeleton, with water and [[carbon dioxide]] as byproducts. As the reef is the result of a favorable equilibrium between construction by the corals and destruction by marine [[erosion]], the rate at which metabolism can proceed determines the growth or deterioration of the reef.

[[Dinoflagellate]]s (algal [[protist]]s) are often [[endosymbiont]]s in the cells of marine invertebrates, where they accelerate host-cell metabolism by generating immediately available sugar and oxygen through [[photosynthesis]] using incident light and the carbon dioxide produced by the host. Stony corals that are reef-building corals ([[hermatypic coral]]s) require [[Endosymbiont|endosymbiotic]] algae from the genus ''[[Symbiodinium]]'' to be in a healthy condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Taylor| first = Dennis L| editor-last = Goff| editor-first = Lynda J| title = Algal Symbiosis: A Continuum of Interaction Strategies| year = 1983| publisher = CUP Archive| isbn = 978-0-521-25541-7| pages = 19–20| contribution = The coral-algal symbiosis }}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of ''Symbiodinium'' from the host is known as [[coral bleaching]], a condition which leads to the deterioration of a reef.

===Sea sponges===
{{Main|Sea sponge}}
Green algae live close to the surface of some sponges, for example, breadcrumb sponge (''[[Halichondria panicea]]''). The alga is thus protected from predators; the sponge is provided with oxygen and sugars which can account for 50 to 80% of sponge growth in some species.&lt;ref&gt;http://uwsp.edu/cnr/UWEXlakes/laketides/vol26-4/vol26-4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life-cycle==
[[Rhodophyta]], [[Chlorophyta]] and [[Heterokontophyta]], the three main algal [[phylum|phyla]], have life-cycles which show tremendous variation with considerable complexity. In general there is an asexual phase where the seaweed's cells are [[diploid]], a sexual phase where the cells are [[haploid]] followed by fusion of the male and female [[gametes]]. Asexual reproduction is advantageous in that it permits efficient population increases, but less variation is possible. Sexual reproduction allows more variation, but is more costly. Often there is no strict alternation between the [[sporophyte]] and also because there is often an asexual phase, which could include the fragmentation of the [[thallus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 02&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lobban and Harrison 94&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author = Christopher S.

==Numbers==
[[File:Taiwan 2009 East Coast ShihTiPing Giant Stone Steps Algae FRD 6581.jpg|thumb|Algae on coastal rocks at [[:zh:石梯坪|Shihtiping]] in Taiwan]]
The ''Algal Collection of the US National Herbarium'' (located in the [[National Museum of Natural History]]) consists of approximately 320,500 dried specimens, which, although not exhaustive (no exhaustive collection exists), gives an idea of the order of magnitude of the number of algal species (that number remains unknown).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Algae Herbarium|publisher=National Museum of Natural History, Department of Botany|year=2008|url=http://botany.si.edu/projects/algae/herbarium.htm|accessdate=19 December 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081201112552/http://botany.si.edu/projects/algae/herbarium.htm| archivedate= 1 December 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates vary widely. For example, according to one standard textbook,&lt;ref name=&quot;John 02&quot;&gt;John (2002), page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; in the British Isles the ''UK Biodiversity Steering Group Report'' estimated there to be 20000 algal species in the UK. Another checklist reports only about 5000 species. Regarding the difference of about 15000 species, the text concludes: &quot;It will require many detailed field surveys before it is possible to provide a reliable estimate of the total number of species&amp;nbsp;...&quot;

Regional and group estimates have been made as well:
* 5000–5500 species of red algae worldwide
* &quot;some 1300 in Australian Seas&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Huisman 00&quot;&gt;Huisman (2000), page 25.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 400 seaweed species for the western coastline of South Africa,&lt;ref name=&quot;Stegenga 97&quot;&gt;Stegenga (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; and 212 species from the coast of KwaZulu-Natal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Clerck| first = Olivier| title = Guide to the seaweeds of KwaZulu-Natal| year = 2005| isbn = 978-90-72619-64-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these are duplicates as the range extends across both coasts, and the total recorded is probably about 500 species. Most of these are listed in [[List of seaweeds of South Africa]]. These exclude phytoplankton and crustose corallines.
* 669 marine species from California (US)&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott and Hollenberg 76&quot;&gt;Abbott and Hollenberg (1976), page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 642 in the check-list of Britain and Ireland&lt;ref name=&quot;Hardy nad Guiry 06&quot;&gt;Hardy and Guiry (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;
and so on, but lacking any scientific basis or reliable sources, these numbers have no more credibility than the British ones mentioned above. Most estimates also omit microscopic algae, such as [[phytoplankton]].

The most recent estimate suggests a total number of 72,500 algal species worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guiry | first1 = M. D. | year = 2012 | title = HOW MANY SPECIES OF ALGAE ARE THERE? | url = | journal = Journal of Phycology | volume = 48 | issue = 5| pages = 1057–1063 | doi = 10.1111/j.1529-8817.2012.01222.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
The distribution of algal species has been fairly well studied since the founding of [[phytogeography]] in the mid-19th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Round (1981), Chapter 8, Dispersal, continuity and phytogeography.&lt;/ref&gt; Algae spread mainly by the dispersal of [[spore]]s analogously to the dispersal of Plantae by seeds and spores. Spores are everywhere in all parts of the Earth: the waters fresh and marine, the atmosphere, free-floating and in precipitation or mixed with dust, the [[humus]] and in other organisms, such as humans. Whether a spore is to grow into an organism depends on the combination of the species and the environmental conditions of where the spore lands.

The spores of fresh-water algae are dispersed mainly by running water and wind, as well as by living carriers.&lt;ref&gt;Round (1981), page 360.&lt;/ref&gt; The bodies of water into which they are transported are chemically selective.{{clarification needed|reason=meaning what exactly?|date=March 2014}} Marine spores are spread by currents. Ocean water is temperature selective, resulting in phytogeographic zones, regions and provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Round (1981), page 362.&lt;/ref&gt;

To some degree the distribution of algae is subject to floristic discontinuities caused by geographical features, such as [[Antarctica]], long distances of ocean or general land masses. It is therefore possible to identify species occurring by locality, such as &quot;Pacific Algae&quot; or &quot;North Sea Algae&quot;. When they occur out of their localities, it is usually possible to hypothesize a transport mechanism, such as the hulls of ships. For example, ''Ulva reticulata'' and ''Ulva fasciata'' travelled from the mainland to Hawaii in this manner.

Mapping is possible for select species only: &quot;there are many valid examples of confined distribution patterns.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Round (1981), Page 357.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''Clathromorphum'' is an arctic genus and is not mapped far south of there.&lt;ref&gt;Round (1981), page 371.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, scientists regard the overall data as insufficient due to the &quot;difficulties of undertaking such studies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Round (1981), page 366.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Phytoplankton Lake Chuzenji.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Phytoplankton, [[Lake Chuzenji]]]]

==Locations==
Algae are prominent in bodies of water, common in terrestrial environments and are found in unusual environments, such as [[Snow algae|on snow]] and [[Ice algae|on ice]]. Seaweeds grow mostly in shallow marine waters, under {{convert|100|m|ft|abbre=on}}; however some have been recorded to a depth of {{convert|360|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;Round (1981), page 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

The various sorts of algae play significant roles in aquatic ecology. Microscopic forms that live suspended in the water column ([[phytoplankton]]) provide the food base for most marine [[food chain]]s. In very high densities ([[algal bloom]]s) these algae may discolor the water and outcompete, poison, or [[asphyxiate]] other life forms.

Algae are variously sensitive to different factors, which has made them useful as biological indicators in the [[Ballantine Scale]] and its modification.

==Cultural associations==
In [[Classical Chinese]], the word {{lang|zh|{{linktext|藻}}}} is used both for &quot;algae&quot; and (in the modest tradition of the [[scholar-official|imperial scholars]]) for &quot;literary talent&quot;. The third island in [[Kunming Lake]] beside the [[Summer Palace]] in Beijing is known as the Zaojian Tang Dao which thus simultaneously means &quot;Island of the Algae-Viewing Hall&quot; and &quot;Island of the Hall for Reflecting on Literary Talent&quot;.

For centuries seaweed has been used as a fertilizer; [[George Owen of Henllys]] writing in the 16th century referring to drift weed in [[South Wales]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England|volume=10|pages=142–143|title=On the Farming of South Wales: Prize Report|first=Clare Sewell|last=Read|authorlink=Clare Sewell Read|year=1849|location=London|publisher=John Murray}} [http://books.google.com/books?id=UJYEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=%22this+kind+of+ore+they+often+gather%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#PPR4,M1 Downloadable Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This kind of ore they often gather and lay on great heapes, where it heteth and rotteth, and will have a strong and loathsome smell; when being so rotten they cast on the land, as they do their muck, and thereof springeth good corn, especially barley&amp;nbsp;... After spring-tydes or great rigs of the sea, they fetch it in sacks on horse backes, and carie the same three, four, or five miles, and cast it on the lande, which doth very much better the ground for corn and grass.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Today, algae are used by humans in many ways; for example, as [[fertilizer]]s, [[soil conditioner]]s and livestock feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = McHugh| first = Dennis J.| title = A Guide to the Seaweed Industry: FAO Fisheries Technical Paper 441| url = http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/006/Y4765E/y4765e0c.htm#TopOfPage| year = 2003| publisher = Fisheries and Aquaculture Department, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations| location = Rome| isbn = 978-92-5-104958-7| chapter = 9, Other Uses of Seaweeds }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquatic and microscopic species are cultured in clear tanks or ponds and are either harvested or used to treat effluents pumped through the ponds. [[Algaculture]] on a large scale is an important type of [[aquaculture]] in some places. [[Maerl]] is commonly used as a soil conditioner.

Naturally growing seaweeds are an important source of food, especially in Asia. They provide many vitamins including: A, [[Thiamine|B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Riboflavin|B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Vitamin B6|B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[niacin]] and [[Vitamin C|C]], and are rich in [[iodine]], [[potassium]], iron, [[magnesium]] and [[calcium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Simoons| first = Frederick J| title = Food in China: A Cultural and Historical Inquiry| year = 1991| publisher = CRC Press| isbn = 978-0-936923-29-1| pages = 179–190| chapter = 6, Seaweeds and Other Algae }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition commercially cultivated [[Microphyte|microalgae]], including both algae and [[cyanobacteria]], are marketed as nutritional supplements, such as [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|Spirulina]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siu.edu/~ebl/leaflets/algae.htm|work=Ethnobotanical Leaflets|title=Modern Uses of Cultivated Algae|publisher=Southern Illinois University Carbondale|first=Steve L|last=Morton|accessdate=26 December 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081223081614/http://www.siu.edu/~ebl/leaflets/algae.htm &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|archivedate=23 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chlorella]] and the Vitamin-C supplement, [[Dunaliella]], high in [[beta-carotene]].

[[File:Dulse.JPG|thumb|243px|Dulse, a type of food.]]The oils from some algae have high levels of [[unsaturated fatty acid]]s. For example, ''[[Parietochloris incisa]]'' is very high in [[arachidonic acid]], where it reaches up to 47% of the triglyceride pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bigogno|first= C|author2=I Khozin-Goldberg|author3= S Boussiba|author4= A Vonshak|author5= Z Cohen|year=2002|journal=Phytochemistry|volume=60|pages=497–503|doi=10.1016/S0031-9422(02)00100-0|pmid=12052516|title=Lipid and fatty acid composition of the green oleaginous alga Parietochloris incisa, the richest plant source of arachidonic acid|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some varieties of algae favored by vegetarianism and [[veganism]] contain the long-chain, essential [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s, [[Docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA) and [[Eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA).

===Pollution control===
* Sewage can be treated with algae, reducing the usage of large amounts of toxic chemicals that would otherwise be needed.
* Algae can be used to capture [[fertilizers]] in runoff from farms. When subsequently harvested, the enriched algae itself can be used as fertilizer.
* Aquariums and ponds can be filtered using algae, which absorb nutrients from the water in a device called an [[algae scrubber]], also known as an &quot;ATS&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reefbase.org/resource_center/publication/main.aspx?refid=10859 Nutrient Cycling In The Great Barrier Reef Aquarium. Proceedings of the 6th International Coral Reef Symposium, Australia, 1988, Vol. 2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=NogyAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=U.S.+Patent+4333263 U.S. Patent 4333263, Issue Date 8 June 1982]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydromentia.com/Products-Services/Algal-Turf-Scrubber/Product-Documentation/Assets/ATS-Technical-Brochure.pdf Hydromentia Water Treatment Technologies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/120083425/abstract Algal Response To Nutrient Enrichment In Forested Oligotrophic Stream. Journal of Phycology, June 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Agricultural Research Service]] scientists found that 60–90% of nitrogen runoff and 70–100% of phosphorus runoff can be captured from [[manure effluents]] using a horizontal algae scrubber, also called an [[algal turf scrubber]] (ATS). Scientists developed the ATS, which are shallow, 100-foot raceways of nylon netting where algae colonies can form, and studied its efficacy for three years. They found that algae can readily be used to reduce the nutrient runoff from agricultural fields and increase the quality of water flowing into rivers, streams, and oceans. The enriched algae itself also can be used as a fertilizer. Researchers collected and dried the nutrient-rich algae from the ATS and studied its potential as an organic fertilizer. They found that cucumber and corn seedlings grew just as well using ATS organic fertilizer as they did with commercial fertilizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Bioremediation===

The algae [[Stichococcus bacillaris]], has been seen to colonize silcone resins used at archaeological sites; biodeterriorating the synthetic substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Microorganisms Attack Synthetic Polymers in Items Representing Our Cultural Heritage |first1=Francesca |last1=Cappitelli |first2=Claudia |journal=Applied Environmental Microbiology |year=2008 |volume=74 |pmc=2227722 |last2=Sorlini |issue=3 |pages=564–569 |doi=10.1128/AEM.01768-07 |pmid=18065627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Analysis of variance''' ('''ANOVA''') is a collection of [[statistical model]]s used to analyze the differences between group means and their associated procedures (such as &quot;variation&quot; among and between groups), developed by [[Ronald Fisher|R.A. Fisher.]] In the ANOVA setting, the observed [[variance]] in a particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation. In its simplest form, ANOVA provides a [[statistical test]] of whether or not the [[mean]]s of several groups are equal, and therefore generalizes the [[Student's t-test#Independent two-sample t-test|''t''-test]] to more than two groups. Doing multiple two-sample t-tests would result in an increased chance of committing a [[type I error]]. For this reason, ANOVAs are useful in comparing (testing) three or more means (groups or variables) for statistical significance.

==Motivating example==
[[File:Anova, no fit..png|thumb|No fit.]][[File:ANOVA fair fit.jpg|thumb|Fair fit]][[File:ANOVA very good fit.jpg|thumb|Very good fit]]The analysis of variance can be used as an exploratory tool to explain observations.  A dog show provides an example.  A dog show is not a random sampling of the breed.  It is typically limited to dogs that are male, adult, pure-bred and exemplary.  A histogram of dog weights from a show might plausibly be rather complex, like the yellow-orange distribution shown in the illustrations.  An attempt to explain the weight distribution by dividing the dog population into groups (young vs old)(short-haired vs long-haired) would probably be a failure (no fit at all). The groups (shown in blue) have a large variance and the means are very close.  An attempt to explain the weight distribution by (pet vs working breed)(less athletic vs more athletic) would probably be somewhat more successful (fair fit).  The heaviest show dogs are likely to be big strong working breeds.  An attempt to explain weight by breed is likely to produce a very good fit.  All Chihuahuas are light and all St Bernards are heavy.  The difference in weights between Setters and Pointers does not justify separate breeds.  The analysis of variance provides the formal tools to justify these intuitive judgments.  A common use of the method is the analysis of experimental data or the development of models.  The method has some advantages over correlation: not all of the data must be numeric and one result of the method is a judgment in the confidence in an explanatory relationship.

==Background and terminology==
ANOVA is a particular form of [[statistical hypothesis testing]] heavily used in the analysis of experimental data.  A statistical hypothesis test is a method of making decisions using data.  A test  result (calculated from the [[null hypothesis]] and the sample) is called statistically significant if it is deemed unlikely to have occurred by chance, ''assuming the truth of the null hypothesis''.  A statistically significant result (when a probability ([[p-value]]) is less than a threshold (significance level)) justifies the rejection of the [[null hypothesis]], but only if the a priori probability of the null hypothesis is not high.

In the typical application of ANOVA, the null hypothesis is that all groups are simply random samples of the same population.  This implies that all treatments have the same effect (perhaps none).  Rejecting  the null hypothesis implies that different treatments result in altered effects.

By construction, hypothesis testing limits the rate 
of Type I errors (false positives leading to false scientific claims) 
to a significance level.  Experimenters also wish to limit Type II 
errors (false negatives resulting in missed scientific discoveries).  
The Type II error rate is a function of several things including 
sample size (positively correlated with experiment cost), significance 
level (when the standard of proof is high, the chances of overlooking 
a discovery are also high) and effect size (when the effect is 
obvious to the casual observer, Type II error rates are low).

The terminology of ANOVA is largely from the statistical 
[[design of experiments]].  The experimenter adjusts factors and 
measures responses in an attempt to determine an effect.  Factors are 
assigned to experimental units by a combination of randomization and 
[[Randomized block design|blocking]] to ensure the validity of the results.  [[Blind experiment|Blinding]] keeps the
weighing impartial.  Responses show a variability that is partially 
the result of the effect and is partially random error.

ANOVA is the synthesis of several ideas and it is used for multiple 
purposes.  As a consequence, it is difficult to define concisely or precisely.

&quot;Classical ANOVA for balanced data does three things at once:
# As exploratory data analysis, an ANOVA is an organization of an additive data decomposition, and its sums of squares indicate the variance of each component of the decomposition (or, equivalently, each set of terms of a linear model).
# Comparisons of mean squares, along with F-tests&amp;nbsp;... allow testing of a nested sequence of models.
# Closely related to the ANOVA is a linear model fit with coefficient estimates and standard errors.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gelman (2005, p 2)&lt;/ref&gt;

In short, ANOVA is a statistical tool used in several ways to develop and confirm an explanation for the observed data.

Additionally:
#&lt;li value=&quot;4&quot;&gt; It is computationally elegant and relatively robust against violations of its assumptions.&lt;/li&gt;
# ANOVA provides industrial strength (multiple sample comparison) statistical analysis.
# It has been adapted to the analysis of a variety of experimental designs.

As a result:
ANOVA &quot;has long enjoyed the status of being the '''most used''' (some would 
say abused) statistical technique in psychological research.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
Howell (2002, p 320)&lt;/ref&gt;
ANOVA &quot;is probably the '''most useful''' technique in the field of 
statistical inference.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, p 63)&lt;/ref&gt;

ANOVA is difficult to teach, particularly for complex experiments, with [[Restricted randomization|split-plot designs]] being notorious.&lt;ref&gt;Gelman (2005, p 1)&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases the proper 
application of the method is best determined by problem pattern recognition 
followed by the consultation of a classic authoritative test.&lt;ref&gt;
Gelman (2005, p 5)&lt;/ref&gt;

; Balanced design: An experimental design where all cells (i.e. treatment combinations) have the same number of observations.
; Blocking: A schedule for conducting treatment combinations in an experimental study such that any effects on the experimental results due to a known change in raw materials, operators, machines, etc., become concentrated in the levels of the blocking variable. The reason for blocking is to isolate a systematic effect and prevent it from obscuring the main effects. Blocking is achieved by restricting randomization.
; Design: A set of experimental runs which allows the fit of a particular model and the estimate of effects.

; Effect: How changing the settings of a factor changes the response. The effect of a single factor is also called a main effect.
; Error: Unexplained variation in a collection of observations. DOE's typically require understanding of both random error and lack of fit error.
; Experimental unit: The entity to which a specific treatment combination is applied.
; Factors: Process inputs an investigator manipulates to cause a change in the output.
; Lack-of-fit error: Error that occurs when the analysis omits one or more important terms or factors from the process model. Including replication in a DOE allows separation of experimental error into its components: lack of fit and random (pure) error.
; Model: Mathematical relationship which relates changes in a given response to changes in one or more factors.
; Random error: Error that occurs due to natural variation in the process. Random error is typically assumed to be normally distributed with zero mean and a constant variance. Random error is also called experimental error.
; Randomization: A schedule for allocating treatment material and for conducting treatment combinations in a DOE such that the conditions in one run neither depend on the conditions of the previous run nor predict the conditions in the subsequent runs.&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Randomization is a term used in multiple ways in this
material.  &quot;Randomization has three roles in applications: as a device 
for eliminating biases, for example from unobserved explanatory 
variables and selection effects: as a basis for estimating standard 
errors: and as a foundation for formally exact significance tests.&quot;  
Cox (2006, page 192)  Hinkelmann and Kempthorne use randomization 
both in experimental design and for statistical analysis.&lt;/ref&gt;
; Replication: Performing the same treatment combination more than once. Including replication allows an estimate of the random error independent of any lack of fit error.
; Responses: The output(s) of a process. Sometimes called dependent variable(s).
; Treatment: A treatment is a specific combination of factor levels whose effect is to be compared with other treatments.

==Classes of models==
There are three classes of models used in the analysis of variance, and these are outlined here.

===Fixed-effects models===
{{Main|Fixed effects model}}
The fixed-effects model of analysis of variance applies to situations in which the experimenter applies one or more treatments to the subjects of the experiment to see if the [[response variable]] values change. This allows the experimenter to estimate the ranges of response variable values that the treatment would generate in the population as a whole.

===Random-effects models===
{{Main|Random effects model}}
Random effects models are used when the treatments are not fixed. This occurs when the various factor levels are sampled from a larger population. Because the levels themselves are [[random variables]], some assumptions and the method of contrasting the treatments (a multi-variable generalization of simple differences) differ from the fixed-effects model.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Chapter 12: Experiments with random factors)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mixed-effects models===
{{Main|Mixed model}}
A mixed-effects model contains experimental factors of both fixed and random-effects types, with appropriately different interpretations and analysis for the two types.

Example:
Teaching experiments could be performed by a university department 
to find a good introductory textbook, with each text considered a 
treatment.  The fixed-effects model would compare a list of candidate 
texts.  The random-effects model would determine whether important 
differences exist among a list of randomly selected texts.  The 
mixed-effects model would compare the (fixed) incumbent texts to 
randomly selected alternatives.

Defining fixed and random effects has proven elusive, with competing 
definitions arguably leading toward a linguistic quagmire.&lt;ref&gt;
Gelman (2005, pp 20–21)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assumptions of ANOVA==
The analysis of variance has been studied from several approaches, the most common of which uses a [[linear model]] that relates the response to the treatments and blocks. Note that the model is linear in parameters but may be nonlinear across factor levels. Interpretation is easy when data is balanced across factors but much deeper understanding is needed for unbalanced data.

===Textbook analysis using a normal distribution===
The analysis of variance can be presented in terms of a [[linear model]], which makes the following assumptions about the [[probability distribution]] of the responses:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Statistical Methods
| last1 = Snedecor | first1 = George W. 
| last2 = Cochran | first2 = William G.

| year = 1996 | edition = 6th| isbn = 0-314-06378-1 | pages = 452–453}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Statistical independence|Independence]] of observations &amp;ndash; this is an assumption of the model that simplifies the statistical analysis.
* [[normal distribution|Normality]] &amp;ndash; the distributions of the [[Residual (statistics)|residuals]] are [[Normal distribution|normal]].
* Equality (or &quot;homogeneity&quot;) of variances, called [[homoscedasticity]] &amp;mdash; the variance of data in groups should be the same.

The separate assumptions of the textbook model imply that the [[errors and residuals in statistics|errors]] are independently, identically, and normally distributed for fixed effects models, that is, that the errors (&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;'s) are independent and

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon \thicksim N(0, \sigma^2).\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Randomization-based analysis===
{{See also|Random assignment|Randomization test}}
In a [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized controlled experiment]], the treatments are randomly assigned to experimental units, following the experimental protocol. This randomization is objective and declared before the experiment is carried out. The objective random-assignment is used to test the significance of the null hypothesis, following the ideas of [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C. S. Peirce]] and [[Ronald A. Fisher]]. This design-based analysis was discussed and developed by [[Francis J. Anscombe]] at [[Rothamsted Experimental Station]] and by [[Oscar Kempthorne]] at [[Iowa State University]].&lt;ref&gt;Anscombe (1948)&lt;/ref&gt; Kempthorne and his students make an assumption of ''unit treatment additivity'', which is discussed in the books of Kempthorne and [[David R. Cox]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

====Unit-treatment additivity====
In its simplest form, the assumption of unit-treatment additivity&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Unit-treatment additivity is simply termed additivity
in most texts.  Hinkelmann and Kempthorne add adjectives and
distinguish between additivity in the strict and broad senses.  This 
allows a detailed consideration of multiple error sources (treatment, 
state, selection, measurement and sampling) on page 161.&lt;/ref&gt; states that the observed response &lt;math&gt;y_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; from experimental unit &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; when receiving treatment &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; can be written as the sum of the unit's response &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; and the treatment-effect &lt;math&gt; t_j&lt;/math&gt;, that is &lt;ref&gt;Kempthorne (1979, p 30)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cox&quot;&gt;Cox (1958, Chapter 2: Some Key Assumptions)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008, Volume 1, Throughout.  Introduced in Section 2.3.3: Principles of experimental design; The linear model; Outline of a model)&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;y_{i,j}=y_i+t_j.&lt;/math&gt;
The assumption of unit-treatment additivity implies that, for every treatment &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;th treatment have  exactly the same effect &lt;math&gt;t_j&lt;/math&gt; on every experiment unit.

The assumption of unit treatment additivity  usually cannot be directly [[falsificationism|falsified]], according to Cox and Kempthorne. However, many ''consequences'' of treatment-unit additivity can be falsified. For a randomized experiment, the assumption of unit-treatment additivity ''implies'' that the variance is constant for all treatments. Therefore, by [[contraposition]], a necessary condition for unit-treatment additivity is that the variance is constant.

The use of unit treatment additivity and randomization is similar to the design-based inference that is standard in finite-population [[survey sampling]].

====Derived linear model====
Kempthorne uses the randomization-distribution and the assumption of ''unit treatment additivity'' to produce a ''derived linear model'', very similar to the textbook model discussed previously.&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008, Volume 1, Section 6.3: 
Completely Randomized Design; Derived Linear Model)&lt;/ref&gt;  The test statistics of this derived linear model are closely approximated by the test statistics of an appropriate normal linear model, according to approximation theorems and simulation studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;HinkelmannKempthorne&quot;&gt;Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008, Volume 1, Section 6.6: Completely randomized design; Approximating the randomization test)&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are differences. For example, the randomization-based analysis results in a small but (strictly) negative correlation between the observations.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey (2008, Chapter 2.14 &quot;A More General Model&quot; in Bailey, pp.&amp;nbsp;38–40)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008, Volume 1, Chapter 7: Comparison of Treatments)&lt;/ref&gt; In the randomization-based analysis, there is ''no assumption'' of a ''normal'' distribution and certainly ''no assumption'' of ''independence''. On the contrary, ''the observations are dependent''!

The randomization-based analysis has the disadvantage that its exposition involves tedious algebra and extensive time.  Since the randomization-based analysis is complicated and is closely approximated by the approach using a normal linear model, most teachers emphasize the normal linear model approach. Few statisticians object to model-based analysis of balanced randomized experiments.

====Statistical models for observational data====
However, when applied to data from non-randomized experiments or [[observational study|observational studies]], model-based analysis lacks the warrant of randomization.&lt;ref&gt;
Kempthorne (1979, pp 125–126, 
&quot;The experimenter must decide which of the various causes that he 
feels will produce variations in his results must be controlled 
experimentally.  Those causes that he does not control experimentally, 
because he is not cognizant of them, he must control by the device of 
randomization.&quot;  &quot;[O]nly when the treatments in the experiment are 
applied by the experimenter using the full randomization procedure is 
the chain of inductive inference sound.  It is ''only'' under these 
circumstances that the experimenter can attribute whatever effects he 
observes to the treatment and the treatment only.  Under these 
circumstances his conclusions are reliable in the statistical sense.&quot;)  
&lt;/ref&gt; For observational data, the derivation of confidence intervals must use ''subjective'' models, as emphasized by [[Ronald A. Fisher]] and his followers. In practice, the estimates of treatment-effects from observational studies  generally are often inconsistent.  In practice, &quot;statistical models&quot; and observational data are useful for suggesting hypotheses that should be treated very cautiously by the public.&lt;ref&gt;Freedman {{full|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Summary of assumptions===
The normal-model based ANOVA analysis assumes the independence, normality and 
homogeneity of the variances of the residuals. The 
randomization-based analysis assumes only the homogeneity of the 
variances of the residuals (as a consequence of unit-treatment 
additivity) and uses the randomization procedure of the experiment. 
Both these analyses require homoscedasticity, as an assumption for the normal-model analysis and as a consequence of randomization and additivity for the randomization-based analysis.

However, studies of processes that 
change variances rather than means (called dispersion effects) have 
been successfully conducted using ANOVA.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery 
(2001, Section 3.8: Discovering dispersion effects)&lt;/ref&gt;  There are
''no'' necessary assumptions for ANOVA in its full generality, but the
F-test used for ANOVA hypothesis testing has assumptions and practical 
limitations which are of continuing interest.

Problems which do not satisfy the assumptions of ANOVA can often be transformed to satisfy the assumptions. 
The property of unit-treatment additivity is not invariant under a &quot;change of scale&quot;, so statisticians often use transformations to achieve unit-treatment additivity. If the response variable is expected to follow a parametric family of probability distributions, then the statistician may specify (in the protocol for the experiment or observational study) that the responses be transformed to stabilize the variance.&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008, Volume 1, Section 6.10: Completely randomized design; Transformations)&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a statistician may specify that logarithmic transforms be applied to the responses, which are believed to follow a multiplicative model.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cox&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailey (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Cauchy's [[functional equation]] theorem, the [[logarithm]] is the only continuous transformation that transforms real multiplication to addition.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Characteristics of ANOVA==
ANOVA is used in the analysis of comparative experiments, those in 
which only the difference in outcomes is of interest.  The statistical
significance of the experiment is determined by a ratio of two 
variances.  This ratio is independent of several possible alterations
to the experimental observations: Adding a constant to all 
observations does not alter significance.  Multiplying all 
observations by a constant does not alter significance.  So ANOVA 
statistical significance results are independent of constant bias and 
scaling errors as well as the units used in expressing observations.  
In the era of mechanical calculation it was common to 
subtract a constant from all observations (when equivalent to 
dropping leading digits) to simplify data entry.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery 
(2001, Section 3-3: Experiments with a single factor: The analysis of 
variance; Analysis of the fixed effects model)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Cochran &amp; Cox (1992, p 2 example)&lt;/ref&gt;  This is an example of data
[[Coding (social sciences)|coding]].

==Logic of ANOVA==
The calculations of ANOVA can be characterized as computing a number
of means and variances, dividing two variances and comparing the ratio 
to a handbook value to determine statistical significance.  Calculating 
a treatment effect is then trivial, &quot;the effect of any treatment is 
estimated by taking the difference between the mean of the 
observations which receive the treatment and the general mean.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
Cochran &amp; Cox (1992, p 49)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partitioning of the sum of squares===
{{main|Partition of sums of squares}}
ANOVA uses traditional standardized terminology.  The definitional 
equation of sample variance is
&lt;math&gt;s^2=\textstyle\frac{1}{n-1}\sum(y_i-\bar{y})^2&lt;/math&gt;, where the 
divisor is called the degrees of freedom (DF), the summation is called 
the sum of squares (SS), the result is called the mean square (MS) and 
the squared terms are deviations from the sample mean.  ANOVA 
estimates 3 sample variances: a total variance based on all the 
observation deviations from the grand mean, an error variance based on 
all the observation deviations from their appropriate 
treatment means and a treatment variance.  The treatment variance is
based on the deviations of treatment means from the grand mean, the 
result being multiplied by the number of observations in each 
treatment to account for the difference between the variance of 
observations and the variance of means.

The fundamental technique is a partitioning of the total [[sum of squares (statistics)|sum of squares]] ''SS'' into components related to the effects used in the model. For example, the model for a simplified ANOVA with one type of treatment at different levels.

:&lt;math&gt;SS_\text{Total} = SS_\text{Error} + SS_\text{Treatments}&lt;/math&gt;

The number of [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] ''DF'' can be partitioned in a similar way: one of these components (that for error) specifies a [[chi-squared distribution]] which describes the associated sum of squares, while the same is true for &quot;treatments&quot; if there is no treatment effect.

:&lt;math&gt;DF_\text{Total} = DF_\text{Error} + DF_\text{Treatments}&lt;/math&gt;

See also [[Lack-of-fit sum of squares]].

===The F-test===
{{Main|F-test}}
The [[F-test]] is used for comparing the factors of the total deviation. For example, in one-way, or single-factor ANOVA, statistical significance is tested for by comparing the F test statistic

:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{\text{variance between treatments}}{\text{variance within treatments}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{MS_\text{Treatments}}{MS_\text{Error}} = {{SS_\text{Treatments} / (I-1)} \over {SS_\text{Error} / (n_T-I)}}&lt;/math&gt;
where  ''MS'' is mean square, &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;  = number of treatments and 
&lt;math&gt;n_T&lt;/math&gt; = total number of cases

to the [[F-distribution]] with &lt;math&gt;I - 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n_T - I&lt;/math&gt;  degrees of freedom. Using the [[F-distribution]] is a natural candidate because the test statistic is the ratio of two scaled sums of squares each of which follows a scaled [[chi-squared distribution]].

The expected value of F is &lt;math&gt;1 + {n \sigma^2_\text{Treatment}} / 
{\sigma^2_\text{Error}}&lt;/math&gt; (where n is the treatment sample size)
which is 1 for no treatment effect.  As values of F increase above 1
the evidence is increasingly inconsistent with the null hypothesis.  
Two apparent experimental methods of increasing F are increasing the
sample size and reducing the error variance by tight experimental 
controls.

The textbook method of concluding the hypothesis test is to compare
the observed value of F with the critical value of F determined from
tables.  The critical value of F is a function of the numerator 
degrees of freedom, the denominator degrees of freedom and the 
significance level (α).  If F ≥ F&lt;sub&gt;Critical&lt;/sub&gt; (Numerator DF, Denominator DF, α)
then reject the null hypothesis.

The computer method calculates the probability (p-value) of a value of 
F greater than or equal to the observed value.  The null hypothesis is 
rejected if this probability is less than or equal to the significance 
level (α).  The two methods produce the same result.

The ANOVA F-test is known to be nearly optimal in the sense of 
minimizing false negative errors for a fixed rate of false positive 
errors (maximizing power for a fixed significance level).  To test the hypothesis that all treatments have exactly the same effect, the [[F-test]]'s p-values closely approximate the [[permutation test]]'s [[p-value]]s: The approximation is particularly close when the design is balanced.&lt;ref name=&quot;HinkelmannKempthorne&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008, Volume 1, Section 6.7: Completely randomized design; CRD with unequal numbers of replications)&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[permutation test]]s characterize [[uniformly most powerful test|tests with maximum power]] against all [[alternative hypothesis|alternative hypotheses]], as observed by Rosenbaum.&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Rosenbaum (2002, page 40) cites Section 5.7 (Permutation Tests), Theorem 2.3 (actually Theorem 3, page 184) of [[Erich Leo Lehmann|Lehmann]]'s ''Testing Statistical Hypotheses'' (1959).&lt;/ref&gt; The ANOVA F–test (of the null-hypothesis that all treatments have exactly the same effect) is recommended as a practical test, because of its robustness against many alternative distributions.&lt;ref&gt;Moore and McCabe (2003, page 763)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;The F-test for the comparison of variances has a mixed reputation.  It 
is not recommended as a hypothesis test to determine whether two 
''different'' samples have the same variance.  It is recommended for 
ANOVA where two estimates of the variance of the ''same'' 
sample are compared.  While the F-test is not generally robust against 
departures from normality, it has been found to be robust in the 
special case of ANOVA.  Citations from Moore &amp; McCabe (2003): 
&quot;Analysis of variance uses F statistics, but these are not 
the same as the F statistic for comparing two population standard 
deviations.&quot; (page 554) &quot;The F test and other procedures for inference 
about variances are so lacking in robustness as to be of little use in 
practice.&quot; (page 556)  &quot;[The ANOVA F test] is relatively insensitive 
to moderate nonnormality and unequal variances, especially when the 
sample sizes are similar.&quot; (page 763)  ANOVA assumes homoscedasticity, 
but it is robust.  The statistical test for homoscedasticity (the 
F-test) is not robust.  Moore &amp; McCabe recommend a rule of thumb.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extended logic===
ANOVA consists of separable parts; partitioning sources of variance 
and hypothesis testing can be used individually.  ANOVA is used to 
support other statistical tools.  Regression is first used to fit more 
complex models to data, then ANOVA is used to compare models with the 
objective of selecting simple(r) models that adequately describe the 
data.  &quot;Such models could be fit without any reference to ANOVA, but 
ANOVA tools could then be used to make some sense of the fitted models, 
and to test hypotheses about batches of coefficients.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gelman&quot;&gt;Gelman (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  
&quot;[W]e think of the analysis of variance as a way of understanding and structuring 
multilevel models—not as an alternative to regression but as a tool 
for summarizing complex high-dimensional inferences&amp;nbsp;...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gelman&quot; /&gt;

==ANOVA for a single factor==
{{Main|One-way analysis of variance}}
The simplest experiment suitable for ANOVA analysis is the completely 
randomized experiment with a single factor.  More complex experiments 
with a single factor involve constraints on randomization and include 
completely randomized blocks and Latin squares (and variants: 
Graeco-Latin squares, etc.).  The more complex experiments share many 
of the complexities of multiple factors.  A relatively complete 
discussion of the analysis (models, data summaries, ANOVA table) of 
the completely randomized experiment is 
[[One-way analysis of variance|available]].

==ANOVA for multiple factors==
{{Main|Two-way analysis of variance}}
ANOVA generalizes to the study of the effects of multiple factors.  
When the experiment includes observations at all combinations of 
levels of each factor, it is termed [[Factorial experiment|factorial]].  
Factorial experiments 
are more efficient than a series of single factor experiments and the 
efficiency grows as the number of factors increases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Montgomery&quot;&gt;Montgomery 
(2001, Section 5-2: Introduction to factorial designs; The advantages 
of factorials)&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, factorial designs are heavily used.

The use of ANOVA to study the effects of multiple factors has a complication.  In a 3-way ANOVA with factors x, y and z, the ANOVA model includes terms for the main effects (x, y, z) and terms for [[Interaction (statistics)|interactions]] (xy, xz, yz, xyz).  
All terms require hypothesis tests.  The proliferation of interaction terms increases the risk that some hypothesis test will produce a false positive by chance. Fortunately, experience says that high order interactions are rare.&lt;ref&gt;Belle (2008, Section 8.4: High-order interactions occur rarely)&lt;/ref&gt;  
The ability to detect interactions is a major advantage of multiple 
factor ANOVA.  Testing one factor at a time hides interactions, but 
produces apparently inconsistent experimental results.&lt;ref name=&quot;Montgomery&quot; /&gt;

Caution is advised when encountering interactions; Test  
interaction terms first and expand the analysis beyond ANOVA if 
interactions are found.  Texts vary in their recommendations regarding 
the continuation of the ANOVA procedure after encountering an 
interaction.  Interactions complicate the interpretation of 
experimental data.  Neither the calculations of significance nor the 
estimated treatment effects can be taken at face value.  &quot;A 
significant interaction will often mask the significance of main effects.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Section 5-1: Introduction to factorial designs; Basic definitions and principles)&lt;/ref&gt;  Graphical methods are recommended
to enhance understanding.  Regression is often useful.  A lengthy discussion of interactions is available in Cox (1958).&lt;ref&gt;Cox (1958, 
Chapter 6: Basic ideas about factorial experiments)&lt;/ref&gt;  Some interactions can be removed (by transformations) while others cannot.

A variety of techniques are used with multiple factor ANOVA to reduce expense. One technique used in factorial designs is to minimize replication (possibly no replication with support of [[Tukey's test of additivity|analytical trickery]]) and to combine groups when effects are found to be statistically (or practically) insignificant.  An experiment with many insignificant factors may collapse into one with a few factors supported by many replications.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Section 5-3.7: Introduction to factorial designs; The two-factor factorial design; One observation per cell)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worked numeric examples==
Several fully worked numerical examples are available.  A 
[[F-test#One-way ANOVA example|simple case]] uses one-way (a single factor) analysis.  A [[Two-way analysis of variance|more complex case]] uses two-way (two-factor) analysis.

==Associated analysis==
Some analysis is required in support of the ''design'' of the experiment while other analysis is performed after changes in the factors are formally found to produce statistically significant changes in the responses.  Because experimentation is iterative, the results of one experiment alter plans for following experiments.

===Preparatory analysis===

====The number of experimental units====

In the design of an experiment, the number of experimental units is planned to satisfy the goals of the experiment. Experimentation is often sequential.

Early experiments are often designed to provide mean-unbiased estimates of treatment effects and of experimental error. Later experiments are often designed to test a hypothesis that a treatment effect has an important magnitude; in this case, the number of experimental units is chosen so that the experiment is within budget and has adequate power, among other goals.

Reporting sample size analysis is generally required in psychology. &quot;Provide information on sample size and the process that led to sample size decisions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson (1999, p 596)&lt;/ref&gt;  The analysis, which is written in the experimental protocol before the experiment is conducted, is examined in grant applications and administrative review boards.

Besides the power analysis, there are less formal methods for selecting the number of experimental units. These include graphical methods based on limiting
the probability of false negative errors, graphical methods based on an expected variation increase (above the residuals) and methods based on achieving a desired confident interval.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Section 3-7: Determining sample size)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Power analysis====
[[Statistical power|Power analysis]] is often applied in the context of ANOVA in order to assess the probability of successfully rejecting the null hypothesis if we assume a certain ANOVA design, effect size in the population, sample size and significance level. Power analysis can assist in study design by determining what sample size would be required in order to have a reasonable chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true.&lt;ref&gt;Howell (2002, Chapter 8: Power)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howell (2002, Section 11.12: Power (in ANOVA))&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howell (2002, Section 13.7: Power analysis for factorial experiments)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore and McCabe (2003, pp 778–780)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Effect size====
{{Main|Effect size}}
Several standardized measures of effect have been proposed for ANOVA to summarize the strength of the association between a predictor(s) and the dependent variable (e.g., &amp;eta;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, &amp;omega;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or &amp;fnof;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) or the overall standardized difference (&amp;Psi;) of the complete model. Standardized effect-size estimates facilitate comparison of findings across studies and disciplines.  However, while standardized effect sizes are commonly used in much of the professional literature, a non-standardized measure of effect size that has immediately &quot;meaningful&quot; units may be preferable for reporting purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson&quot;&gt;Wilkinson (1999, p 599)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Followup analysis===
It is always appropriate to carefully consider outliers.  They have a disproportionate impact on statistical conclusions and are often the result of errors.

====Model confirmation====
It is prudent to verify that the assumptions of ANOVA have been met. Residuals are examined or analyzed to confirm homoscedasticity and gross normality.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Section 3-4: Model adequacy checking)&lt;/ref&gt;  Residuals should have the appearance of (zero mean normal distribution) noise when plotted as a function of anything including time and 
modeled data values. Trends hint at interactions among factors or among observations.  One rule of thumb: &quot;If the largest standard deviation is less than twice the smallest standard deviation, we can use methods based on the assumption of equal standard deviations and our results 
will still be approximately correct.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Moore and McCabe (2003, p 755, Qualifications to this rule appear in a footnote.)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Follow-up tests====
A statistically significant effect in ANOVA is often followed up with one or more different follow-up tests. This can be done in order to assess which groups are different from which other groups or to test various other focused hypotheses. Follow-up tests are often distinguished in terms of whether they are planned ([[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]) or [[Post-hoc analysis|post hoc]]. Planned tests are determined before looking at the data and post hoc tests are performed after looking at the data.

Often one of the &quot;treatments&quot; is none, so the treatment group can act as a control.  [[Dunnett's test]] (a modification of the t-test) tests whether each of the other treatment groups has the same 
mean as the control.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Section 3-5.8: Experiments with a single factor: The analysis of 
variance; Practical interpretation of results; Comparing means with a control)&lt;/ref&gt;

Post hoc tests such as [[Tukey's range test]] most commonly compare every group mean with every other group mean and typically incorporate some method of controlling for Type I errors. Comparisons, which are most commonly planned, can be either simple or compound. Simple comparisons compare one group mean with one other group mean. Compound comparisons typically compare two sets of groups means where one set has two or more groups (e.g., compare average group means of group A, B and C with group D). Comparisons can also look at tests of trend, such as linear and quadratic relationships, when the independent variable involves ordered levels.

Following ANOVA with pair-wise multiple-comparison tests has been criticized on several grounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008, Volume 1, Section 7.5: 
Comparison of Treatments; Multiple Comparison Procedures)&lt;/ref&gt; There are many such tests (10 in one table) and recommendations regarding their use are vague or conflicting.&lt;ref&gt;Howell (2002, Chapter 12: Multiple comparisons among treatment means)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Section 3-5: Practical interpretation of results)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Study designs and ANOVAs==
There are several types of ANOVA. Many statisticians base ANOVA on the [[experimental design|design of the experiment]],&lt;ref&gt;Cochran &amp; Cox (1957, p 9,
&quot;[T]he general rule [is] that the way in which the experiment is conducted determines not only whether inferences can be made, but also the calculations required to make them.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; especially on the protocol that specifies the [[random assignment]] of treatments to subjects; the protocol's description of the assignment mechanism should include a specification of the structure of the treatments and of any [[blocking (statistics)|blocking]]. It is also common to apply ANOVA to observational data using an appropriate statistical model.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Some popular designs use the following types of ANOVA:
*[[One-way ANOVA]] is used to test for differences among two or more [[statistical independence|independent]] groups (means),e.g. different levels of urea application in a crop. Typically, however, the one-way ANOVA is used to test for differences among at least three groups, since the two-group case can be covered by a [[t-test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1093/biomet/6.1.1|noedit}}&lt;/ref&gt; When there are only two means to compare, the [[t-test]] and the ANOVA [[F-test]] are equivalent; the relation between ANOVA and ''t'' is given by ''F''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
*[[Factorial experiment|Factorial]] ANOVA is used when the experimenter wants to study the interaction effects among the treatments.
*[[Repeated measures]] ANOVA is used when the same subjects are used for each treatment (e.g., in a [[longitudinal study]]).
*[[Multivariate analysis of variance]] (MANOVA) is used when there is more than one [[dependent variable|response variable]].

==ANOVA cautions==
Balanced experiments (those with an equal sample size for each treatment) are relatively easy to interpret; Unbalanced 
experiments offer more complexity.  For single factor (one way) ANOVA, the adjustment for unbalanced data is easy, but the unbalanced analysis lacks both robustness and power.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Section 3-3.4: Unbalanced data)&lt;/ref&gt;  For more complex designs the lack of balance leads to further complications. &quot;The orthogonality property of main effects and interactions present in balanced data does not carry over to the unbalanced case. This means that the usual analysis of variance techniques do not apply.  
Consequently, the analysis of unbalanced factorials is much more difficult than that for balanced designs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Section 14-2: Unbalanced data in factorial design)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the general case, &quot;The analysis of variance can also be applied to unbalanced data, but then the sums of squares, mean squares, and F-ratios will depend on the order in which the sources of variation 
are considered.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gelman&quot; /&gt;  The simplest techniques for handling unbalanced data restore balance by either throwing out data or by synthesizing missing data.  More complex techniques use regression.

ANOVA is (in part) a significance test.  The American Psychological Association holds the view that simply reporting significance is insufficient and that reporting confidence bounds is preferred.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson&quot; /&gt;

While ANOVA is conservative (in maintaining a significance level) against [[multiple comparisons]] in one dimension, it is not conservative against comparisons in multiple dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson (1999, p 600)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalizations==
ANOVA is considered to be a special case of [[linear regression]]&lt;ref&gt;Gelman (2005, p.1) (with qualification in the later text)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Section 3.9: The Regression Approach to the Analysis of Variance)&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn is a special case of the [[general linear model]].&lt;ref&gt;Howell (2002, p 604)&lt;/ref&gt; All consider the observations to be the sum of a model (fit) and a residual (error) to be minimized.

The [[Kruskal&amp;ndash;Wallis test]] and the [[Friedman test]] are [[nonparametric]] tests, which  do not rely on an assumption of normality.&lt;ref&gt;Howell (2002, Chapter 18: Resampling and nonparametric approaches to data)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Section 3-10: Nonparametric methods in the analysis of variance)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
While the analysis of variance reached fruition in the 20th century,
antecedents extend centuries into the past according to Stigler.&lt;ref&gt;
Stigler (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;  These include hypothesis testing, the partitioning of sums of 
squares, experimental techniques and the additive model.  [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]] was
performing hypothesis testing in the 1770s.&lt;ref&gt;Stigler (1986, p 134)&lt;/ref&gt;  
The development of least-squares methods by Laplace and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] circa 
1800 provided an improved method of combining observations (over the 
existing practices of astronomy and geodesy).  It also initiated much 
study of the contributions to sums of squares.  Laplace soon knew how 
to estimate a variance from a residual (rather than a total) sum of 
squares.&lt;ref&gt;Stigler (1986, p 153)&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1827 Laplace was using least 
squares methods to address ANOVA problems regarding measurements of 
atmospheric tides.&lt;ref&gt;Stigler (1986, pp&amp;nbsp;154–155)&lt;/ref&gt;  
Before 1800 astronomers had isolated observational errors resulting 
from reaction times (the &quot;[[personal equation]]&quot;) and had developed 
methods of reducing the errors.&lt;ref&gt;Stigler (1986, pp&amp;nbsp;240–242)&lt;/ref&gt;  The 
experimental methods used in the study of the personal equation were 
later accepted by the emerging field of psychology &lt;ref&gt;Stigler (1986, 
Chapter 7 - Psychophysics as a Counterpoint)&lt;/ref&gt; which developed strong 
(full factorial) experimental methods to which randomization and 
blinding were soon added.&lt;ref&gt;Stigler (1986, p 253)&lt;/ref&gt;  An eloquent 
non-mathematical explanation of the additive effects model was
available in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Stigler (1986, pp&amp;nbsp;314–315)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir Ronald Fisher introduced the term &quot;variance&quot; and proposed a formal analysis of [[variance]] in a 1918 article ''[[The Correlation Between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Correlation Between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance''. Ronald A. Fisher. ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh''. 1918. (volume 52, pages 399–433)&lt;/ref&gt;  His first application of the analysis of variance was published in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;On the &quot;Probable Error&quot; of a Coefficient of Correlation Deduced from a Small Sample. Ronald A. Fisher. Metron, 1: 3-32 (1921)&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of variance became widely known after being included in Fisher's 1925 book ''[[Statistical Methods for Research Workers]]''.

Randomization models were developed by several researchers.  The first was 
published in Polish by [[Neyman]] in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;
Scheffé (1959, p 291, &quot;Randomization models were first formulated by 
Neyman (1923) for the completely randomized design, by Neyman (1935) 
for randomized blocks, by Welch (1937) and Pitman (1937) for the Latin 
square under a certain null hypothesis, and by Kempthorne (1952, 1955) 
and Wilk (1955) for many other designs.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the attributes of ANOVA which ensured its early popularity was 
computational elegance.  The structure of the additive model allows 
solution for the additive coefficients by simple algebra rather than 
by matrix calculations.  In the era of mechanical calculators this 
simplicity was critical.  The determination of statistical 
significance also required access to tables of the F function which 
were supplied by early statistics texts.

[[Image:Methane-2D-stereo.svg|right|thumb|Chemical structure of [[methane]], the simplest alkane]]

In [[organic chemistry]], an '''alkane''', or '''paraffin''' (a still-used historical name that also has [[paraffin|other meanings]]), is a [[saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] [[hydrocarbon]]. Alkanes consist only of [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon]] atoms and all bonds are [[single bond]]s. Acyclic alkanes have the general chemical formula {{Carbon}}&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;{{Hydrogen}}&lt;sub&gt;2n+2&lt;/sub&gt;. Alkanes belong to a [[homologous series]] of organic compounds in which the members differ by a [[molecular mass]] of 14.03u (mass of a [[methylene bridge|methanediyl group]], —CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;—, one carbon atom of mass 12.01u, and two hydrogen atoms of mass {{Unicode|&amp;#x2248;}}1.01u each). There are two main commercial sources: [[petroleum|crude oil]] and [[natural gas]].

Each carbon atom has 4 bonds (either [[C-H bond|C-H]] or [[C-C bond]]s), and each hydrogen atom is joined to a carbon atom (H-C bonds). A series of linked carbon atoms is known as the [[skeletal formula|carbon skeleton]] or carbon backbone. The number of carbon atoms is used to define the size of the alkane (e.g., C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-alkane).

An '''[[alkyl]] group''', generally abbreviated with the symbol R, is a [[functional group]] or side-chain that, like an alkane, consists solely of single-bonded carbon and hydrogen atoms, for example a [[methyl]] or [[ethyl group]].

The simplest possible alkane (the parent molecule) is [[methane]], CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. There is no limit to the number of carbon atoms that can be linked together, the only limitation being that the molecule is acyclic, is [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturated]], and is a [[hydrocarbon]]. Saturated [[oils]] and [[waxes]] are examples of larger alkanes where the number of carbons in the carbon backbone is greater than 10.

Alkanes are not very reactive and have little [[biological activity]]. All alkanes are colourless and odourless. Alkanes can be viewed as a molecular tree upon which can be hung the more biologically active/reactive portions ([[functional groups]]) of the molecule.

* linear (general formula {{chem|C|''n''|H|2''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2}}) wherein the carbon atoms are joined in a snake-like structure
* branched (general formula {{chem|C|''n''|H|2''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2}}, ''n'' &gt; 3) wherein the carbon backbone splits off in one or more directions
* [[Cyclic compound|cyclic]] (general formula {{chem|C|''n''|H|2''n''}}, ''n'' &gt; 2) wherein the carbon backbone is linked so as to form a loop.

According to the definition by [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]], the former two are alkanes, whereas the third group is called [[cycloalkane]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef | title=alkanes | file = A00222 | date = 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saturated hydrocarbons can also combine any of the linear, cyclic (e.g., polycyclic) and branching structures, and they are still alkanes (no general formula) as long as they are [[Open chain compound|acyclic]] (i.e., having no loops).They also have single covalent bonds between their carbons.

==Isomerism==
[[Image:Saturated C4 hydrocarbons ball-and-stick.png|thumb|right| Different C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-alkanes and -cycloalkanes (left to right): [[n-butane|''n''-butane]] and [[isobutane]] are the two C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; isomers; [[cyclobutane]] and [[methylcyclopropane]] are the two C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; isomers.&lt;br /&gt; Bicyclo[1.1.0]butane is the only C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; compound and has no isomer; [[tetrahedrane]] (not shown) is the only C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; compound and has also no isomer.]]

Alkanes with more than three carbon atoms can be arranged in various different ways, forming [[structural isomer]]s. The simplest isomer of an alkane is the one in which the carbon atoms are arranged in a single chain with no branches. This isomer is sometimes called the ''n''-isomer (''n'' for &quot;normal&quot;, although it is not necessarily the most common). However the chain of carbon atoms may also be branched at one or more points. The number of possible isomers increases rapidly with the number of carbon atoms. For example:&lt;ref name= OEIS &gt;[[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences]] {{OEIS|id=A000602}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:  [[methane]] only
* C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:  [[ethane]] only
* C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:  [[propane]] only
* C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;: 2 isomers: [[n-butane|''n''-butane]] and [[isobutane]]
* C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;: 3 isomers: [[pentane]], [[isopentane]], and [[neopentane]]
* C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;: 5 isomers: [[hexane]], [[2-Methylpentane|2-methylpentane]], [[3-Methylpentane|3-methylpentane]], [[2,2-Dimethylbutane|2,2-dimethylbutane]], and [[2,3-Dimethylbutane|2,3-dimethylbutane]]
* C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;: 355 isomers 
* C&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt;: 27,711,253,769 isomers
* C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;: 22,158,734,535,770,411,074,184 isomers, many of which are not stable.

Branched alkanes can be [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]]. For example [[3-methylhexane]] and its higher [[Homology (chemistry)|homologues]] are chiral due to their [[stereogenic center]] at carbon atom number 3. In addition to these isomers, the chain of carbon atoms may form one or more loops. Such compounds are called [[cycloalkane]]s.

==Nomenclature==
{{Main|IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry}}
The [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry#Alkanes|IUPAC nomenclature]] (systematic way of naming compounds) for alkanes is based on identifying hydrocarbon chains. Unbranched, saturated hydrocarbon chains are named systematically with a Greek numerical prefix denoting the number of carbons and the suffix &quot;-ane&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/93/r93_184.htm | accessdate = 12 February 2007 | chapter = R-2.2.1: Hydrocarbons | author = IUPAC, Commission on Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry | title = A Guide to IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Compounds (Recommendations 1993) | year = 1993 | publisher = Blackwell Scientific | isbn = 0-632-03488-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1866, [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]] suggested systematizing nomenclature by using the whole sequence of vowels a, e, i, o and u to create suffixes -ane, -ene, -ine (or -yne), -one, -une, for the [[hydrocarbons]]  C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2n+2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2n&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2n-2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2n-4&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2n-6&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chem.yale.edu/~chem125/125/history99/5Valence/Nomenclature/alkanenames.html Alkane Nomenclature&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Now, the first three name hydrocarbons with single, double and triple bonds;&lt;ref&gt;Thus, the ending &quot;-diene&quot; is applied in some cases where von Hofmann had &quot;-ine&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;-one&quot; represents a [[ketone]]; &quot;-ol&quot; represents an alcohol or OH group; &quot;-oxy-&quot; means an [[ether]] and refers to oxygen between two carbons, so that methoxy-methane is the IUPAC name for dimethyl ether.

It is difficult or impossible to find compounds with more than one IUPAC name. This is because shorter chains attached to longer chains are prefixes and the convention includes brackets. Numbers in the name, referring to which carbon a group is attached to, should be as low as possible, so that 1- is implied and usually omitted from names of organic compounds with only one side-group. Symmetric compounds will have two ways of arriving at the same name.

===Linear alkanes===
Straight-chain alkanes are sometimes indicated by the prefix ''n-'' (for ''normal'') where a non-linear [[isomer]] exists. Although this is not strictly necessary, the usage is still common in cases where there is an important difference in properties between the straight-chain and branched-chain isomers, e.g., [[hexane|''n''-hexane]] or 2- or 3-methylpentane.

The members of the series (in terms of number of carbon atoms) are named as follows:
:[[methane]], CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; - one carbon and four hydrogen
:[[ethane]], C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; - two carbon and six hydrogen
:[[propane]], C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; - three carbon and 8 hydrogen
:[[butane]], C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; - four carbon and 10 hydrogen
:[[pentane]], C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; - five carbon and 12 hydrogen
:[[hexane]], C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; - six carbon and 14 hydrogen

The first four names were [[back-formation|derived]] from [[methanol]], [[diethyl ether|ether]], [[propionic acid]] and [[butyric acid]], respectively. Alkanes with five or more carbon atoms are named by adding the [[Affix|suffix]] '''-ane''' to the appropriate [[IUPAC numerical multiplier|numerical multiplier]] prefix&lt;ref name = reusch-nom&gt;{{cite web | author = William Reusch | work = Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry | title = Nomenclature - Alkanes | url = http://www.cem.msu.edu/~reusch/VirtualText/nomen1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; with elision of any terminal vowel (''-a'' or ''-o'') from the basic numerical term. Hence, [[pentane]], C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;; [[hexane]], C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;; [[heptane]], C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;; [[octane]], C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;; etc. The prefix is generally Greek, however alkanes with a carbon atom count ending in nine, for example [[nonane]], use the [[Latin language|Latin]] prefix '''non-'''. For a more complete list, see [[List of alkanes]].

===Branched alkanes===
[[Image:Isopentane-numbered-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|[[Ball-and-stick model]] of [[isopentane]] (common name) or 2-methylbutane (IUPAC systematic name)]]
Simple branched alkanes often have a common name using a prefix to distinguish them from linear alkanes, for example [[pentane|''n''-pentane]], [[isopentane]], and [[neopentane]].

IUPAC naming conventions can be used to produce a systematic name.

The key steps in the naming of more complicated branched alkanes are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = William Reusch | work = Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry | title = Examples of the IUPAC Rules in Practice | url = http://www.cem.msu.edu/~reusch/VirtualText/nomexmp1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Identify the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms
* Name this longest root chain using standard naming rules
* Name each side chain by changing the suffix of the name of the alkane from &quot;-ane&quot; to &quot;-yl&quot;
* Number the root chain so that sum of the numbers assigned to each side group will be as low as possible
* Number and name the side chains before the name of the root chain
* If there are multiple side chains of the same type, use prefixes such as &quot;di-&quot; and &quot;tri-&quot; to indicate it as such, and number each one.
* Add side chain names in alphabetical (disregarding &quot;di-&quot; etc. prefixes) order in front of the name of the root chain

===Cyclic alkanes===
{{Main|Cycloalkane}}

So-called cyclic alkanes are, in the technical sense, ''not'' alkanes, but cycloalkanes. They are hydrocarbons just like alkanes, but contain one or more rings.

Simple cycloalkanes have a prefix &quot;cyclo-&quot; to distinguish them from alkanes. Cycloalkanes are named as per their acyclic counterparts with respect to the number of carbon atoms, e.g., [[cyclopentane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;) is a cycloalkane with 5 carbon atoms just like [[pentane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;), but they are joined up in a five-membered ring. In a similar manner, [[propane]] and [[cyclopropane]], [[butane]] and [[cyclobutane]], etc.

Substituted cycloalkanes are named similar to substituted alkanes — the cycloalkane ring is stated, and the substituents are according to their position on the ring, with the numbering decided by [[Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules]].&lt;ref name=reusch-nom/&gt;

===Trivial names===
The trivial (non-[[IUPAC nomenclature|systematic]]) name for alkanes is ''paraffins''. Together, alkanes are known as the ''paraffin series''. Trivial names for compounds are usually historical artifacts. They were coined before the development of systematic names, and have been retained due to familiar usage in industry. Cycloalkanes are also called naphthenes.

It is almost certain that the term ''paraffin'' stems from the petrochemical industry. Branched-chain alkanes are called ''[[isoparaffin]]s''. The use of the term &quot;paraffin&quot; is a general term and often does not distinguish between pure compounds and mixtures of [[isomers]], i.e., compounds with the same [[chemical formula]], e.g., [[pentane]] and [[isopentane]].

;Examples
The following trivial names are retained in the IUPAC system:
* [[isobutane]] for 2-methylpropane
* [[isopentane]] for 2-methylbutane
* [[neopentane]] for 2,2-dimethylpropane.

==Physical properties==

All alkanes are colourless and odourless.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nsdl.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/777/1/Revised+organic+chemistry.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://textbook.s-anand.net/ncert/class-11/chemistry/13-hydrocarbons]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boiling point===
[[Image:AlkaneBoilingMeltingPoint.png|right|thumb|400px|Melting (blue) and boiling (orange) points of the first 16 ''n''-alkanes in °C.]]

Alkanes experience inter-molecular [[van der Waals force]]s. Stronger inter-molecular van der Waals forces give rise to greater boiling points of alkanes.&lt;ref name=m&amp;b&gt;{{cite book|title = Organic Chemistry | author = R. T. Morrison, R. N. Boyd | isbn = 0-13-643669-2 | publisher = Prentice Hall | location = New Jersey | edition = 6th|year = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two determinants for the strength of the van der Waals forces:
* the number of electrons surrounding the molecule, which increases with the alkane's molecular weight
* the surface area of the molecule

Under [[standard conditions]], from CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; alkanes are gaseous; from C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;36&lt;/sub&gt; they are liquids; and after C&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;38&lt;/sub&gt; they are solids. As the boiling point of alkanes is primarily determined by weight, it should not be a surprise that the boiling point has almost a linear relationship with the size ([[molecular weight]]) of the molecule. As a rule of thumb, the boiling point rises 20–30&amp;nbsp;°C for each carbon added to the chain; this rule applies to other homologous series.&lt;ref name = m&amp;b/&gt;

A straight-chain alkane will have a boiling point higher than a branched-chain alkane due to the greater surface area in contact, thus the greater van der Waals forces, between adjacent molecules. For example, compare [[isobutane]] (2-methylpropane) and [[n-butane]] (butane), which boil at −12 and 0&amp;nbsp;°C, and 2,2-dimethylbutane and 2,3-dimethylbutane which boil at 50 and 58&amp;nbsp;°C, respectively.&lt;ref name = m&amp;b/&gt; For the latter case, two molecules 2,3-dimethylbutane can &quot;lock&quot; into each other better than the cross-shaped 2,2-dimethylbutane, hence the greater van der Waals forces.

On the other hand, cycloalkanes tend to have higher boiling points than their linear counterparts due to the locked conformations of the molecules, which give a plane of intermolecular contact.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

===Melting point===
The [[melting point]]s of the alkanes follow a similar trend to [[boiling points]] for the same reason as outlined above. That is, (all other things being equal) the larger the molecule the higher the melting point. There is one significant difference between boiling points and melting points. Solids have more rigid and fixed structure than liquids. This rigid structure requires energy to break down. Thus the better put together solid structures will require more energy to break apart. For alkanes, this can be seen from the graph above (i.e., the blue line). The odd-numbered alkanes have a lower trend in melting points than even numbered alkanes. This is because even numbered alkanes pack well in the solid phase, forming a well-organized structure, which requires more energy to break apart. The odd-number alkanes pack less well and so the &quot;looser&quot; organized solid packing structure requires less energy to break apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Boese R, Weiss HC, Blaser D | title= The melting point alternation in the short-chain n-alkanes: Single-crystal X-ray analyses of propane at 30 K and of n-butane to n-nonane at 90 K | journal= Angew Chemie Int Ed | year=1999 | volume=38 | pages=988–992 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-3773(19990401)38:7&lt;988::AID-ANIE988&gt;3.3.CO;2-S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The melting points of branched-chain alkanes can be either higher or lower than those of the corresponding straight-chain alkanes, again depending on the ability of the alkane in question to pack well in the solid phase: This is particularly true for isoalkanes (2-methyl isomers), which often have melting points higher than those of the linear analogues.

===Conductivity and solubility===
Alkanes do not conduct [[electricity]], nor are they substantially [[Relative static permittivity|polarized]] by an [[electric field]]. For this reason they do not form [[hydrogen bond]]s and are insoluble in polar solvents such as water. Since the hydrogen bonds between individual water molecules are aligned away from an alkane molecule, the coexistence of an alkane and water leads to an increase in molecular order (a reduction in [[entropy]]). As there is no significant bonding between water molecules and alkane molecules, the [[second law of thermodynamics]] suggests that this reduction in entropy should be minimized by minimizing the contact between alkane and water: Alkanes are said to be [[hydrophobic]] in that they repel water.

Their solubility in nonpolar solvents is relatively good, a property that is called [[lipophilicity]]. Different alkanes are, for example, miscible in all proportions among themselves.

The density of the alkanes usually increases with increasing number of carbon atoms, but remains less than that of water. Hence, alkanes form the upper layer in an alkane-water mixture.

===Molecular geometry===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Nylon]] --&gt;
[[Image:Ch4 hybridization.svg|thumb|right|sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-hybridization in [[methane]].]]
The molecular structure of the alkanes directly affects their physical and chemical characteristics. It is derived from the [[electron configuration]] of [[carbon]], which has four [[valence electron]]s. The carbon atoms in alkanes are always [[Orbital hybridization|sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybridized]], that is to say that the valence electrons are said to be in four equivalent orbitals derived from the combination of the 2s orbital and the three 2p orbitals. These orbitals, which have identical energies, are arranged spatially in the form of a [[tetrahedron]], the angle of cos&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(−⅓) ≈ 109.47° between them.

===Bond lengths and bond angles===
An alkane molecule has only C – H and C – C single bonds. The former result from the overlap of a sp³-orbital of carbon with the 1s-orbital of a hydrogen; the latter by the overlap of two sp³-orbitals on different carbon atoms. The [[bond length]]s amount to 1.09×10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m for a C – H bond and 1.54×10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m for a C – C bond.
[[Image:Ch4-structure.png|thumb|right|The tetrahedral structure of methane.]]

The spatial arrangement of the bonds is similar to that of the four sp³-orbitals—they are tetrahedrally arranged, with an angle of 109.47° between them. Structural formulae that represent the bonds as being at right angles to one another, while both common and useful, do not correspond with the reality.

===Conformation===
{{Main|Alkane stereochemistry}}

The structural formula and the [[bond angle]]s are not usually sufficient to completely describe the geometry of a molecule. There is a further [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]] for each carbon – carbon bond: the [[torsion angle]] between the atoms or groups bound to the atoms at each end of the bond. The spatial arrangement described by the torsion angles of the molecule is known as its [[conformational isomerism|conformation]].
[[Image:Newman projection ethane.png|thumb|right|200px|Newman projections of the two conformations of ethane: eclipsed on the left, staggered on the right.]]
[[Image:Ethane-rotamers-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Ball-and-stick model]]s of the two rotamers of ethane]]

[[Ethane]] forms the simplest case for studying the conformation of alkanes, as there is only one C – C bond. If one looks down the axis of the C – C bond, one will see the so-called [[Newman projection]]. The hydrogen atoms on both the front and rear carbon atoms have an angle of 120° between them, resulting from the projection of the base of the tetrahedron onto a flat plane. However, the torsion angle between a given hydrogen atom attached to the front carbon and a given hydrogen atom attached to the rear carbon can vary freely between 0° and 360°. This is a consequence of the free rotation about a carbon – carbon single bond. Despite this apparent freedom, only two limiting conformations are important: [[eclipsed]] conformation and [[staggered conformation]].

The two conformations, also known as [[rotamer]]s, differ in energy: The staggered conformation is 12.6 kJ/mol lower in energy (more stable) than the eclipsed conformation (the least stable).

This difference in energy between the two conformations, known as the [[torsion energy]], is low compared to the thermal energy of an ethane molecule at ambient temperature. There is constant rotation about the C-C bond. The time taken for an ethane molecule to pass from one staggered conformation to the next, equivalent to the rotation of one CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-group by 120° relative to the other, is of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;seconds.

The case of [[higher alkanes]] is more complex but based on similar principles, with the antiperiplanar conformation always being the most favored around each carbon-carbon bond. For this reason, alkanes are usually shown in a zigzag arrangement in diagrams or in models. The actual structure will always differ somewhat from these idealized forms, as the differences in energy between the conformations are small compared to the thermal energy of the molecules: Alkane molecules have no fixed structural form, whatever the models may suggest.

===Spectroscopic properties===
Virtually all organic compounds contain carbon – carbon and carbon – hydrogen bonds, and so show some of the features of alkanes in their spectra. Alkanes are notable for having no other groups, and therefore for the ''absence'' of other characteristic spectroscopic features of different functional group like -OH,-CHO,-COOH etc.

====Infrared spectroscopy====
The carbon–hydrogen stretching mode gives a strong absorption between 2850 and 2960&amp;nbsp;[[Wavenumber|cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;]], while the carbon–carbon stretching mode absorbs between 800 and 1300&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The carbon–hydrogen bending modes depend on the nature of the group: methyl groups show bands at 1450&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and 1375&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, while methylene groups show bands at 1465&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and 1450&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Carbon chains with more than four carbon atoms show a weak absorption at around 725&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

====NMR spectroscopy====
The proton resonances of alkanes are usually found at [[chemical shift|δ&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;]] = 0.5 – 1.5. The carbon-13 resonances depend on the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon: δ&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; = 8 – 30 (primary, methyl, -CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), 15 – 55 (secondary, methylene, -CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-), 20 – 60 (tertiary, methyne, C-H) and quaternary. The carbon-13 resonance of quaternary carbon atoms is characteristically weak, due to the lack of [[Nuclear Overhauser effect]] and the long [[relaxation time]], and can be missed in weak samples, or samples that have not been run for a sufficiently long time.

====Mass spectrometry====
Alkanes have a high [[ionization energy]], and the molecular ion is usually weak. The fragmentation pattern can be difficult to interpret, but, in the case of branched chain alkanes, the carbon chain is preferentially cleaved at tertiary or quaternary carbons due to the relative stability of the resulting [[free radical]]s. The fragment resulting from the loss of a single methyl group (M−15) is often absent, and other fragment are often spaced by intervals of fourteen mass units, corresponding to sequential loss of CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-groups.

==Chemical properties==

Alkanes are only weakly reactive with ionic and other polar substances. The [[acid dissociation constant]] (pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) values of all alkanes are above 60, hence they are practically inert to acids and bases (see: [[carbon acid]]s). This inertness is the source of the term ''paraffins'' (with the meaning here of &quot;lacking affinity&quot;). In [[crude oil]] the alkane molecules have remained chemically unchanged for millions of years.

However redox reactions of alkanes, in particular with oxygen and the halogens, are possible as the carbon atoms are in a strongly reduced condition; in the case of methane, the lowest possible oxidation state for carbon (−4) is reached. Reaction with oxygen (''if'' present in sufficient quantity to satisfy the reaction [[stoichiometry]]) leads to combustion without any smoke, producing [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water]]. [[Free radical halogenation]] reactions occur with halogens, leading to the production of [[haloalkanes]]. In addition, alkanes have been shown to interact with, and bind to, certain transition metal complexes in (See: [[carbon-hydrogen bond activation]]).

[[Free radical]]s, molecules with unpaired electrons, play a large role in most reactions of alkanes, such as cracking and reformation where long-chain alkanes are converted into shorter-chain alkanes and straight-chain alkanes into branched-chain isomers.

In highly branched alkanes, the bond angle may differ significantly from the optimal value (109.5°) in order to allow the different groups sufficient space. This causes a tension in the molecule, known as [[steric hindrance]], and can substantially increase the reactivity.

===Reactions with oxygen (combustion reaction)===
All alkanes react with [[oxygen]] in a [[combustion]] reaction, although they become increasingly difficult to ignite as the number of carbon atoms increases. The general equation for complete combustion is:
:C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2''n''+2&lt;/sub&gt; + (1.5''n''+0.5)O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → (''n''+1)H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + ''n''CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
or C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2''n''+2&lt;/sub&gt; + ((3n+1)/2)O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → (''n''+1)H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + ''n''CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

In the absence of sufficient oxygen, [[carbon monoxide]] or even [[soot]] can be formed, as shown below:

:C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;(2''n''+2)&lt;/sub&gt; + (''n''+0.5)[[oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] → (''n''+1)H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + ''n''[[carbon monoxide|CO]]

:C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;(2''n''+2)&lt;/sub&gt; + (0.5''n''+0.5)[[oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] → (''n''+1)H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + ''n''[[carbon|C]]

For example [[methane]]:
:2CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 3O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2CO + 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
:CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 1.5O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CO + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

See the [[Standard enthalpy change of formation (data table)#Alkanes|alkane heat of formation table]] for detailed data.
The [[standard enthalpy change of combustion]], Δ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''H''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;s&gt;o&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, for alkanes increases by about 650&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol per CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group. Branched-chain alkanes have lower values of Δ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''H''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;s&gt;o&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; than straight-chain alkanes of the same number of carbon atoms, and so can be seen to be somewhat more stable.

=== Reactions with halogens ===
{{Main|Free radical halogenation}}
Alkanes react with [[halogen]]s in a so-called ''free radical halogenation'' reaction. The hydrogen atoms of the alkane are progressively replaced by halogen atoms. [[Free-radical]]s are the reactive species that participate in the reaction, which usually leads to a mixture of products. The reaction is highly [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]], and can lead to an explosion.

These reactions are an important industrial route to halogenated hydrocarbons. There are three steps:
* '''Initiation''' the halogen radicals form by [[homolysis (chemistry)|homolysis]]. Usually, energy in the form of heat or light is required.
* '''Chain reaction''' or '''Propagation''' then takes place—the halogen radical abstracts a hydrogen from the alkane to give an alkyl radical. This reacts further.
* '''Chain termination''' where step the radicals recombine.

Experiments have shown that all halogenation produces a mixture of all possible isomers, indicating that all hydrogen atoms are susceptible to reaction. The mixture produced, however, is not a statistical mixture: Secondary and tertiary hydrogen atoms are preferentially replaced due to the greater stability of secondary and tertiary free-radicals. An example can be seen in the monobromination of propane:&lt;ref name = m&amp;b/&gt; [In the Figure below, the Statistical Distribution should be 25% and 75%]
[[Image:Monobromination of propane.png|500px|center|Monobromination of [[propane]]]]

=== Cracking ===
{{Main|Cracking (chemistry)}}
Cracking breaks larger molecules into smaller ones. This can be done with a thermal or catalytic method. The thermal cracking process follows a [[homolysis (chemistry)|homolytic]] mechanism with formation of [[free-radical]]s. The catalytic cracking process involves the presence of [[acid]] [[catalyst]]s (usually solid acids such as [[silica-alumina]] and [[zeolite]]s), which promote a [[heterolytic cleavage|heterolytic]] (asymmetric) breakage of bonds yielding pairs of [[ion]]s of opposite charges, usually a [[carbocation]] and the very unstable [[hydride]] [[anion]]. Carbon-localized free-radicals and cations are both highly unstable and undergo processes of chain rearrangement, C-C scission in position [[beta scission|beta]] (i.e., cracking) and [[intramolecular|intra-]] and [[intermolecular]] hydrogen transfer or [[hydride]] transfer. In both types of processes, the corresponding [[reactive intermediate]]s (radicals, ions) are permanently regenerated, and thus they proceed by a self-propagating chain mechanism. The chain of reactions is eventually terminated by radical or ion recombination.

=== Isomerization and reformation ===
Dragan and his colleague were the first to report about isomerization in alkanes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asinger, Friedrich 1967&quot;&gt;Asinger, Friedrich. Paraffins; Chemistry and Technology. Oxford: Pergamon Press, 1967. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Isomerization and reformation are processes in which straight-chain alkanes are heated in the presence of a [[platinum]] catalyst. In isomerization, the alkanes become branched-chain isomers. In other words, it does not lose any carbons or hydrogens, keeping the same molecular weight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asinger, Friedrich 1967&quot;/&gt; In reformation, the alkanes become [[cycloalkane]]s or [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s, giving off hydrogen as a by-product. Both of these processes raise the [[octane number]] of the substance.  Butane is the most common alkane that is put under the process of isomerization, as it makes many branched alkanes with high octane numbers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asinger, Friedrich 1967&quot;/&gt;

===Other reactions===
Alkanes will react with [[steam]] in the presence of a [[nickel]] [[catalyst]] to give [[hydrogen]]. Alkanes can be [[Chlorosulfonation|chlorosulfonated]] and [[nitration|nitrated]], although both reactions require special conditions. The [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] of alkanes to [[carboxylic acid]]s is of some technical importance. In the [[Reed reaction]], [[sulfur dioxide]], [[chlorine]] and [[photochemistry|light]] convert hydrocarbons to [[Sulfonic acid|sulfonyl chlorides]]. [[Nucleophilic abstraction|Nucleophilic Abstraction]] can be used to separate an alkane from a metal.  Alkyl groups can be transferred from one compound to another by [[transmetalation]] reactions.

==Occurrence==

===Occurrence of alkanes in the Universe===
[[Image:Jupiter.jpg|thumb|right|[[Methane]] and [[ethane]] make up a tiny proportion&lt;!-- 0.3% methane and 0.00006% ethane is tiny not large --&gt; of [[Jupiter]]'s atmosphere]]
[[Image:Oil well.jpg|thumb|right|Extraction of oil, which contains many different [[hydrocarbon]]s including alkanes]]

Alkanes form a small portion&lt;!-- 0.3% methane and 0.00006% ethane for Jupiter is small not significant: else find cite that claims this is significant, or specify in which context. Uranus and Neptune have more but still small --&gt; of the [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmospheres]] of the outer gas planets such as [[Jupiter]] (0.1% methane, 0.0002% ethane), [[Saturn]] (0.2% methane, 0.0005% ethane), [[Uranus]] (1.99% methane, 0.00025% ethane) and [[Neptune]] (1.5% methane, 1.5 ppm ethane). [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] (1.6% methane), a satellite of Saturn, was examined by the [[Huygens (spacecraft)|''Huygens'' probe]], which indicated that Titan's atmosphere periodically rains liquid methane onto the moon's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Titan: Arizona in an Icebox?|url=http://www.planetary.org/news/2005/huygens_science-results_0121.html|author=Emily Lakdawalla|accessdate=21 January 2004|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080406104505/http://planetary.org/news/2005/0121_Titan_Arizona_in_an_Icebox.html|archivedate=6 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also on Titan the Cassini mission has imaged seasonal Methane/Ethane lakes near the polar regions of Titan. [[Methane]] and [[ethane]] have also been detected in the tail of the comet [[Hyakutake]]. Chemical analysis showed that the abundances of ethane and methane were roughly equal, which is thought to imply that its ices formed in interstellar space, away from the Sun, which would have evaporated these volatile molecules.&lt;ref name=&quot;science&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Mumma, M.J. | title=Detection of Abundant Ethane and Methane, Along with Carbon Monoxide and Water, in Comet C/1996 B2 Hyakutake: Evidence for Interstellar Origin | journal=Science | year=1996 | volume=272 | doi=10.1126/science.272.5266.1310 | pmid=8650540 | coauthors = Disanti, M.A., dello Russo, N., Fomenkova, M., Magee-Sauer, K., Kaminski, C.D., and D.X. Xie | issue=5266 | bibcode=1996Sci...272.1310M | pages=1310–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alkanes have also been detected in [[meteorite]]s such as [[carbonaceous chondrite]]s.

===Occurrence of alkanes on Earth===
Traces of methane gas (about 0.0002% or 1745 ppb) occur in the Earth's atmosphere, produced primarily by [[methanogenesis|methanogenic]] microorganisms, such as [[Archaea]] in the gut of ruminants.&lt;ref name=Janssen&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Janssen | first1 = P. H. | last2 = Kirs | first2 = M. | year = 2008 | title = Structure of the Archaeal Community of the Rumen | url = | journal = Appl Environ Microbiol | volume = 74 | issue = 12| pages = 3619–3625 | doi = 10.1128/AEM.02812-07 |pmc= 2446570 | pmid=18424540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important commercial sources for alkanes are [[natural gas]] and [[Petroleum|oil]].&lt;ref name=m&amp;b/&gt; Natural gas contains primarily methane and ethane, with some [[propane]] and [[butane]]: oil is a mixture of liquid alkanes and other [[hydrocarbons]]. These hydrocarbons were formed when marine animals and plants (zooplankton and phytoplankton) died and sank to the bottom of ancient seas and were covered with sediments in an [[wikt:anoxic|anoxic]] environment and converted over many millions of years at high temperatures and high pressure to their current form. Natural gas resulted thereby for example from the following reaction:
:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; → 3CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 3CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

These hydrocarbon deposits, collected in porous rocks trapped beneath impermeable cap rocks, comprise commercial [[oil fields]]. They have formed over millions of years and once exhausted cannot be readily replaced. The depletion of these hydrocarbons reserves is the basis for what is known as the [[energy crisis]].

Methane is also present in what is called [[biogas]], produced by animals and decaying matter, which is a possible [[renewable energy source]].

Alkanes have a low solubility in water, so the content in the oceans is negligible; however, at high pressures and low temperatures (such as at the bottom of the oceans), methane can co-crystallize with water to form a solid [[methane clathrate]] (methane hydrate). Although this cannot be commercially exploited at the present time, the amount of combustible energy of the known methane clathrate fields exceeds the energy content of all the natural gas and oil deposits put together. Methane extracted from methane clathrate is therefore a candidate for future fuels.

===Biological occurrence===
Acyclic alkanes occur in nature in various ways.

;Bacteria and archaea
[[Image:Rotbuntes Rind.jpg|thumb|right|[[Methanogen]]ic [[archaea]] in the gut of this cow are responsible for some of the [[methane]] in Earth's atmosphere.]]
Certain types of [[bacteria]] can metabolize alkanes: they prefer even-numbered carbon chains as they are easier to degrade than odd-numbered chains.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

On the other hand, certain [[archaea]], the [[methanogen]]s, produce large quantities of [[methane]] by the metabolism of [[carbon dioxide]] or other [[oxidation|oxidized]] organic compounds. The energy is released by the oxidation of [[hydrogen]]:
:CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Methanogens are also the producers of [[marsh gas]] in [[wetlands]], and release about two billion tonnes of methane per year{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}—the atmospheric content of this gas is produced nearly exclusively by them. The methane output of [[cattle]] and other [[herbivore]]s, which can release up to 150&amp;nbsp;liters per day,{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} and of [[termite]]s,{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} is also due to methanogens. They also produce this simplest of all alkanes in the [[intestine]]s of humans. Methanogenic archaea are, hence, at the end of the [[carbon cycle]], with carbon being released back into the atmosphere after having been fixed by [[photosynthesis]]. It is probable that our current deposits of [[natural gas]] were formed in a similar way.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

;Fungi and plants
Alkanes also play a role, if a minor role, in the biology of the three [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] groups of organisms: [[Fungus|fungi]], plants and animals. Some specialized yeasts, e.g., ''Candida tropicale'', ''[[Pichia]]'' sp., ''[[Rhodotorula]]'' sp., can use alkanes as a source of carbon and/or energy. The fungus ''[[Amorphotheca resinae]]'' prefers the longer-chain alkanes in [[aviation fuel]], and can cause serious problems for aircraft in tropical regions.&lt;ref name=Hendey&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hendey | first1 = N. I. | year = 1964 | title = Some observations on Cladosporium resinae as a fuel contaminant and its possible role in the corrosion of aluminium alloy fuel tanks | url = | journal = Transactions of the British Mycological Society | volume = 47 | issue = 7| pages = 467–475 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In plants, the solid long-chain alkanes are found in the [[plant cuticle]] and [[epicuticular wax]] of many species, but are only rarely major constituents.&lt;ref name=Baker1982&gt;EA Baker (1982) Chemistry and morphology of plant epicuticular waxes. pp139-165. In &quot;The Plant Cuticle&quot;. edited by DF Cutler, KL Alvin and CE Price. Academic Press, London. ISBN 0-12-199920-3&lt;/ref&gt; They protect the plant against water loss, prevent the [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]] of important minerals by the rain, and protect against bacteria, fungi, and harmful insects. The carbon chains in plant alkanes are usually odd-numbered, between twenty-seven and thirty-three carbon atoms in length&lt;ref name=Baker1982/&gt; and are made by the plants by [[decarboxylation]] of even-numbered [[fatty acid]]s. The exact composition of the layer of wax is not only species-dependent, but changes also with the season and such environmental factors as lighting conditions, temperature or humidity.&lt;ref name=Baker1982/&gt;

More volatile short-chain alkanes are also produced by and found in plant tissues. The [[Jeffrey pine]] is noted for producing exceptionally high levels of n-[[heptane]] in its resin, for which reason its distillate was designated as the zero point for one [[octane rating]]. Floral scents have also long been known to contain volatile alkane components, and n-[[nonane]] is a significant component in the scent of some [[rose]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 =HyunJung | last2=Kim | first2=NamSun | last3=Lee | first3=DongSun | year =  2000 | title = Determination of floral fragrances of Rosa hybrida using solid-phase trapping-solvent extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. | url = | journal = Journal of Chromatography, A | volume = 902 | issue = 2| pages =  389–404 | doi = 10.1016/S0021-9673(00)00863-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Emission of gaseous and volatile alkanes such as [[ethane]], [[pentane]], and [[hexane]] by plants has also been documented at low levels, though they are not generally considered to be a major component of biogenic air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kesselmeier
 | first1 =J. | last2=Staudt | first2=N. | year =  1999 | title = Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC): An Overview on Emission, Physiology and Ecology | url =http://www.geo.uni-frankfurt.de/iau/epos/Gruppenintern/Kesselmeier___Staudt_JAC_1999.pdf | journal = Journal of Atmospheric Chemistry | volume = 33 | pages =  22–38  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edible vegetable oils also typically contain small fractions of biogenic alkanes with a wide spectrum of carbon numbers, mainly 8 to 35, usually peaking in the low to upper 20s, with concentrations up to dozens of milligrams per kilogram (parts per million by weight) and sometimes over a hundred for the total alkane fraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moreda

;Animals
Alkanes are found in animal products, although they are less important than unsaturated hydrocarbons. One example is the shark liver oil, which is approximately 14% [[pristane]] (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane, C&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;). They are important as [[pheromone]]s, chemical messenger materials, on which insects depend for communication. In some species, e.g. the support beetle ''[[Xylotrechus colonus]]'', [[pentacosane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;52&lt;/sub&gt;), 3-methylpentaicosane (C&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;54&lt;/sub&gt;) and 9-methylpentaicosane (C&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;54&lt;/sub&gt;) are transferred by body contact. With others like the [[tsetse fly]] ''Glossina morsitans morsitans'', the pheromone contains the four alkanes 2-methylheptadecane (C&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;38&lt;/sub&gt;), 17,21-dimethylheptatriacontane (C&lt;sub&gt;39&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;), 15,19-dimethylheptatriacontane (C&lt;sub&gt;39&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;) and 15,19,23-trimethylheptatriacontane (C&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;82&lt;/sub&gt;), and acts by smell over longer distances. [[waggle dance|Waggle-dancing]] [[honey bee]]s produce and release two alkanes, tricosane and pentacosane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thom | first1 =  ''et al.'' | date = 21 August 2007 | title = The Scent of the Waggle Dance | url = | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 9| page = e228 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0050228 | pmid=17713987 | pmc=1994260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological relations===
[[Image:Ophrys sphegodes flower.jpg|thumb|right|Early spider orchid (''[[Ophrys sphegodes]]'')]]
One example, in which both plant and animal alkanes play a role, is the ecological relationship between the [[sand bee]] (''[[Andrena nigroaenea]]'') and the [[early spider orchid]] (''[[Ophrys sphegodes]]''); the latter is dependent for [[pollination]] on the former. Sand bees use pheromones in order to identify a mate; in the case of ''A. nigroaenea'', the females emit a mixture of [[tricosane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;48&lt;/sub&gt;), [[pentacosane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;52&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[heptacosane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;56&lt;/sub&gt;) in the ratio 3:3:1, and males are attracted by specifically this odor. The orchid takes advantage of this mating arrangement to get the male bee to collect and disseminate its pollen; parts of its flower not only resemble the appearance of sand bees, but also produce large quantities of the three alkanes in the same ratio as female sand bees. As a result numerous males are lured to the blooms and attempt to copulate with their imaginary partner: although this endeavor is not crowned with success for the bee, it allows the orchid to transfer its pollen,
which will be dispersed after the departure of the frustrated male to different blooms.

==Production==

===Petroleum refining===
[[Image:ShellMartinez-refi.jpg|thumb|right|An [[oil refinery]] at [[Martinez, California]].]]
As stated earlier, the most important source of alkanes is [[natural gas]] and [[crude oil]].&lt;ref name=m&amp;b/&gt; Alkanes are separated in an [[oil refinery]] by [[fractional distillation]] and processed into many different products.

===Fischer-Tropsch===
The [[Fischer-Tropsch process]] is a method to synthesize liquid hydrocarbons, including alkanes, from [[carbon monoxide]] and hydrogen. This method is used to produce substitutes for [[petroleum distillates]].

===Laboratory preparation===
There is usually little need for alkanes to be synthesized in the laboratory, since they are usually commercially available. Also, alkanes are generally non-reactive chemically or biologically, and do not undergo [[functional group interconversion]]s cleanly. When alkanes are produced in the laboratory, it is often a side-product of a reaction. For example, the use of [[N-Butyllithium|''n''-butyllithium]] as a strong [[base (chemistry)|base]] gives the conjugate acid, n-butane as a side-product:

: C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;Li + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; + [[lithium hydroxide|LiOH]]

However, at times it may be desirable to make a portion of a molecule into an alkane like functionality ([[alkyl]] group) using the above or similar methods. For example, an [[ethyl group]] is an alkyl group; when this is attached to a [[Hydroxyl|hydroxy]] group, it gives [[ethanol]], which is not an alkane. To do so, the best-known methods are [[hydrogenation]] of [[alkene]]s:

:RCH=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → RCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (R = [[alkyl]])

Alkanes or alkyl groups can also be prepared directly from [[alkyl halide]]s in the [[Corey-House-Posner-Whitesides reaction]].

:[[Image:Clemmensen Reduction Scheme.png|250px|[[Clemmensen Reduction]]]]

==Applications==
The applications of a certain alkane can be determined quite well according to the number of carbon atoms. The first four alkanes are used mainly for heating and cooking purposes, and in some countries for electricity generation. [[Methane]] and [[ethane]] are the main components of natural gas; they are normally stored as gases under pressure. It is, however, easier to transport them as liquids: This requires both compression and cooling of the gas.

[[Propane]] and [[butane]] can be liquefied at fairly low pressures, and are well known as [[liquified petroleum gas]] (LPG). Propane, for example, is used in the propane gas burner and as a fuel for cars,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ferrellgas.com/Resource_/PageResource/LA_Transit_Case_Study.pdf Using propane as a fuel]&lt;/ref&gt; butane in disposable cigarette lighters. The two alkanes are used as propellants in [[aerosol spray]]s.

From [[pentane]] to [[octane]] the alkanes are reasonably volatile liquids. They are used as fuels in [[internal combustion engine]]s, as they vaporise easily on entry into the combustion chamber without forming droplets, which would impair the uniformity of the combustion. Branched-chain alkanes are preferred as they are much less prone to premature ignition, which causes [[Engine knocking|knocking]], than their straight-chain homologues. This propensity to premature ignition is measured by the [[octane rating]] of the fuel, where [[2,2,4-trimethylpentane]] (''isooctane'') has an arbitrary value of 100, and [[heptane]] has a value of zero. Apart from their use as fuels, the middle alkanes are also good [[solvent]]s for nonpolar substances.

Alkanes from [[nonane]] to, for instance, [[hexadecane]] (an alkane with sixteen carbon atoms) are liquids of higher [[viscosity]], less and less suitable for use in gasoline. They form instead the major part of [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] and [[aviation fuel]]. Diesel fuels are characterized by their [[cetane number]], cetane being an old name for hexadecane. However, the higher melting points of these alkanes can cause problems at low temperatures and in polar regions, where the fuel becomes too thick to flow correctly.

Alkanes from hexadecane upwards form the most important components of [[fuel oil]] and [[lubricating oil]]. In the latter function, they work at the same time as anti-corrosive agents, as their hydrophobic nature means that water cannot reach the metal surface. Many solid alkanes find use as [[paraffin wax]], for example, in [[candle]]s. This should not be confused however with true [[wax]], which consists primarily of [[ester]]s.

Alkanes with a chain length of approximately 35 or more carbon atoms are found in [[bitumen]], used, for example, in road surfacing. However, the higher alkanes have little value and are usually split into lower alkanes by [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]].

Some synthetic [[polymers]] such as [[polyethylene]] and [[polypropylene]] are alkanes with chains containing hundreds of thousands of carbon atoms. These materials are used in innumerable applications, and billions of kilograms of these materials are made and used each year.

==Environmental transformations==
When released in the environment, alkanes don't undergo rapid biodegradation, because they have no functional groups (like [[hydroxyl]] or [[carbonyl]]) that are needed by most organisms in order to metabolize the compound.

However, some bacteria can metabolize some alkanes (especially those linear and short), by [[oxidation|oxidizing]] the terminal carbon atom. The product is an [[alcohol]], that could be next oxidized to an [[aldehyde]], and finally to a [[carboxylic acid]]. The resulting [[fatty acid]] could be metabolized through the [[fatty acid degradation]] pathway.

==Hazards==
Methane is explosive when mixed with air (1 – 8% CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Other lower alkanes can also form explosive mixtures with air. The lighter liquid alkanes are highly flammable, although this risk decreases with the length of the carbon chain. Pentane, hexane, heptane, and octane are classed as ''dangerous for the environment'' and ''harmful''. The straight-chain isomer of hexane is a [[neurotoxin]].

'''Considerations for detection /risk control:'''
* Methane is lighter than air (possibility of accumulation under roofs)
* Ethane is slightly heavier than air (possibility of pooling at ground levels / pits)
* Propane is heavier than air (possibility of pooling at ground levels / pits)
* Butane is heavier than air (possibility of pooling at ground levels / pits)

In '''United States appellate procedure''', an [[appeal]] is a petition for review of a case that has been decided by a court of law.  The petition is made to a higher court for the purpose of overturning the lower court's decision.

[[File:D.C. Court of Appeals.JPG|thumb|The [[District of Columbia Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]

The specific procedures for appealing, including even whether there is a right of appeal from a particular type of decision, can vary greatly from state to state. The right to file an appeal can also vary from state to state; for example, the [[New Jersey Constitution]] vests judicial power in a Supreme Court, a Superior Court, and other courts of limited jurisdiction, with an appellate court being part of the Superior Court.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey S. Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books), chapter 1:2&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of an appeal can vary greatly depending on the type of case and the rules of the court in the [[jurisdiction]] where the case was prosecuted.  There are many types of [[standard of review]] for appeals, such as ''[[Trial de novo|de novo]]'' and [[abuse of discretion]].

An [[appellate court]] is a [[court]] that hears cases on appeal from another court. Depending on the particular legal rules that apply to each circumstance, a party to a [[court case]] who is unhappy with the result might be able to challenge that result in an appellate court on specific grounds. These grounds typically could include errors of law, [[fact]], procedure or due process.

In different jurisdictions, appellate courts are also called appeals courts, courts of appeals, superior courts, or supreme courts.

==Access to appellant status==
A party who files an appeal is called an &quot;appellant&quot;, &quot;plaintiff in error&quot;, &quot;petitioner&quot; or &quot;pursuer&quot;, and a party on the other side is called a &quot;appellee&quot;. A &quot;cross-appeal&quot; is an appeal brought by the respondent. For example, suppose at trial the judge found for the plaintiff and ordered the defendant to pay $50,000. If the defendant files an appeal arguing that he should not have to pay any money, then the plaintiff might file a cross-appeal arguing that the defendant should have to pay $200,000 instead of $50,000.

The appellant is the party who, having lost part or all their [[lawsuit|claim]] in a [[lower court]] decision, is appealing to a higher court to have their case reconsidered. This is usually done on the basis that the lower court judge erred in the application of law, but it may also be possible to appeal on the basis of court misconduct, or that a finding of fact was entirely unreasonable to make on the evidence.

The appellant in the new case can be either the [[plaintiff]] (or claimant), [[defendant]], third-party [[intervenor]], or respondent (appellee) from the lower case, depending on who was the losing party. The winning party from the lower court, however, is now the respondent. In unusual cases the appellant can be the victor in the court below, but still appeal.

An appellee is the party to an appeal in which the lower court [[judgment (law)|judgment]] was in its favor. The appellee is required to respond to the [[petition]], [[oral argument]]s, and [[legal brief]]s of the appellant. In general, the appellee takes the procedural posture that the lower court's decision should be affirmed.

==Ability to appeal==
An appeal &quot;as of right&quot; is one that is guaranteed by statute or some underlying constitutional or legal principle.  The appellate court cannot refuse to listen to the appeal.  An appeal &quot;by leave&quot; or &quot;permission&quot; requires the appellant to obtain leave to appeal; in such a situation either or both of the lower court and the appellate court may have the discretion to grant or refuse the appellant's demand to appeal the lower court's decision. In the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]], review in most cases is available only if the Court exercises its discretion and grants a writ of certiorari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/supct/10.html|title=U.S. Supreme Court Rule 10|publisher=Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[tort]], [[equity (law)|equity]], or other civil matters either party to a previous case may file an appeal.  In criminal matters, however, the state or prosecution generally has no appeal &quot;as of right&quot;.  And due to the [[double jeopardy]] principle, the state or prosecution may never appeal a jury or bench verdict of acquittal.  But in some jurisdictions, the state or prosecution may appeal &quot;as of right&quot; from a trial court's dismissal of an indictment in whole or in part or from a trial court's granting of a defendant's suppression motion.  Likewise, in some jurisdictions, the state or prosecution may appeal an issue of law &quot;by leave&quot; from the trial court and/or the appellate court.  The ability of the prosecution to appeal a decision in favor of a defendant varies significantly internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawreform.ie/publications/data/lrc119/lrc_119.html|title=Consultation Paper on Prosecution Appeals Brought in Cases of Indictment|publisher=Law Reform Commission of Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt; All parties must present grounds to appeal, or it will not be heard.

By convention in some law reports, the appellant is named first.  This can mean that where it is the defendant who appeals, the name of the case in the law reports reverses (in some cases twice) as the appeals work their way up the court hierarchy. This is not always true, however.  In the [[United States federal courts|federal courts]], the parties' names always stay in the same order as the lower court when an appeal is taken to the [[United States Courts of Appeals|circuit courts of appeals]], and are re-ordered only if the appeal reaches the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]].

==Direct or collateral: Appealing criminal convictions==
Many jurisdictions recognize two types of appeals, particularly in the ''criminal context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-03|url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/law/hamlyn/postconv.htm|title=UK Law Online |publisher=University of Leeds }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-03|url=http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/28C154.txt|title=Special Habeas Corpus Procedures in Capital Cases |publisher=United States Office of the Law Revision Counsel }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-03|url=http://www.twelfth.courts.state.oh.us/Decisions/Pre00011.doc|title=State of Ohio |publisher=Ohio 12th District Court of Appeals |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080227072142/http://www.twelfth.courts.state.oh.us/Decisions/Pre00011.doc &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first is the traditional &quot;direct&quot; appeal in which the appellant files an appeal with the next higher court of review.  The second is the collateral appeal or post-conviction petition, in which the petitioner-appellant files the appeal in a court of first instance—usually the court that tried the case.

The key distinguishing factor between direct and collateral appeals is that the former occurs in state courts, and the latter in federal courts.

Relief in post-conviction is rare and is most often found in [[capital punishment|capital]] or violent [[felony]] cases.  The typical scenario involves an incarcerated defendant locating [[DNA]] evidence demonstrating the defendant's actual innocence.

===Appellate review===
&quot;Appellate review&quot; is the general term for the process by which courts with appellate [[jurisdiction]] take jurisdiction of matters decided by lower courts. It is distinguished from [[Judicial review (theory)|judicial review]], which refers to the court's overriding constitutional or statutory right to determine if a legislative act or administrative decision is defective for jurisdictional or other reasons (which may vary by jurisdiction).

In most jurisdictions the normal and preferred way of seeking appellate review is by filing an appeal of the final [[Legal judgment|judgment]]. Generally, an appeal of the judgment will also allow appeal of all other orders or rulings made by the trial court in the course of the case.  This is because such orders cannot be appealed &quot;as of right&quot;. However, certain critical interlocutory [[court order]]s, such as the denial of a request for an interim [[injunction]], or an order holding a person in [[contempt of court]], can be appealed immediately although the case may otherwise not have been fully disposed of.

There are two distinct forms of appellate review, &quot;direct&quot; and &quot;collateral&quot;. For example, a criminal defendant may be convicted in state court, and lose on &quot;direct appeal&quot; to higher state appellate courts, and if unsuccessful, mount a &quot;collateral&quot; action such as filing for a writ of [[habeas corpus]] in the [[United States federal courts|federal courts]]. Generally speaking, &quot;[d]irect appeal statutes afford defendants the opportunity to challenge the merits of a judgment and allege errors of law or fact. ... [Collateral review], on the other hand, provide[s] an independent and civil inquiry into the validity of a conviction and sentence, and as such are generally limited to challenges to constitutional, jurisdictional, or other fundamental violations that occurred at trial.&quot; &quot;Graham v. Borgen&quot;, 483 F 3d. 475 (7th Cir. 2007) (no. 04-4103) (slip op. at 7) (citation omitted).

In Anglo-American [[common law]] courts, appellate review of lower court decisions may also be obtained by filing a petition for review by [[prerogative writ]] in certain cases.  There is no corresponding right to a writ in any pure or continental [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] legal systems, though some mixed systems such as [[Civil Code of Quebec|Quebec]] recognize these prerogative writs.

====Direct Appeal====
After exhausting the first appeal as of right, defendants usually petition the highest state court to review the decision. This appeal is known as a direct appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bickford|first=James|title=Opinion Recap:All Judicial Review is either direct or collateral|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2011/03/opinion-summary-all-judicial-review-is-either-direct-or-collateral/|work=Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act|publisher=SCOTUS Bblog|accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest state court, generally known as the Supreme Court, exercises discretion over whether it will review the case. On direct appeal, a prisoner challenges the grounds of the conviction based on an error that occurred at trial or some other stage in the adjudicative process.

=====Preservation Issues=====
An appellant's claim(s) must usually be preserved at trial. This means that the defendant had to object to the error when it occurred in the trial. Because constitutional claims are of great magnitude, appellate courts might be more lenient to review the claim even if it was not preserved. For example Connecticut applies the following standard to review unpreserved claims: 1.the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; 2. the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; 3. the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; 4. if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dauman|first=Chad|title=Criminal Appeals in the United States: Preservation Issues|url=http://www.Chaddauman.blogspot.com|work=blog|accessdate=2011-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====State Post Conviction Relief: Collateral Appeal====
All States have a post-conviction relief process.  Similar to federal post-conviction relief, an appellant can petition the court to correct alleged fundamental errors that were not corrected on direct review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yackle|first=Larry|title=Federal Courts, Habeas Corpus|year=2003|publisher=Thomson Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typical claims might include [[ineffective assistance of counsel]] and actual innocence based on new evidence. These proceedings are separate from the direct appeal. As such, the conviction is considered final. An appeal from the post conviction court proceeds just as a direct appeal. That is, it goes to the intermediate appellate court, followed by the highest court. If the petition is granted the appellant could be released from incarceration, the sentence could be modified, or a new trial could be ordered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Process For Post-Conviction Relief|url=http://www.doj.state.or.us/victims/pdf/pcvap_handout_post_conviction.pdf|work=Oregon Department of Justice|publisher=Oregon Department of Justice|accessdate=4/27,11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Habeas Corpus====
{{main|Habeas corpus in the United States}}

==Notice of appeal==
A &quot;notice of appeal&quot; is a form or document that in many cases is required to begin an appeal. The form is completed by the appellant or by the appellant's legal representative. The nature of this form can vary greatly from country to country and from court to court within a country.

The specific rules of the legal system will dictate exactly how the appeal is officially begun. For example, the appellant might have to file the notice of appeal with the appellate court, or with the court from which the appeal is taken, or both.

Some courts have samples of a notice of appeal on the court's own web site.  In New Jersey, for example, the Administrative Office of the Court has promulgated a form of notice of appeal for use by appellants, though using this exact form is not mandatory and the failure to use it is not a jurisdictional defect provided that all pertinent information is set forth in whatever form of notice of appeal is used.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey S. Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books)&lt;/ref&gt;

The deadline for beginning an appeal can often be very short: traditionally, it is measured in days, not months. This can vary from country to country, as well as within a country, depending on the specific rules in force. In the U.S. federal court system, criminal defendants must file a notice of appeal within 10 days of the entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed, or the right to appeal is forfeited.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Rule 4(b)(1)(A)|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28a/usc_sec_28a_00000004----000-.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appellate procedure==
{{See also|United States courts of appeals}}
Generally speaking the appellate court examines the record of [[evidence (law)|evidence]] presented in the trial court and the law that the lower court applied and decides whether that decision was legally sound or not.  The appellate court will typically be deferential to the lower court's findings of fact (such as whether a defendant committed a particular act), unless clearly erroneous, and so will focus on the court's application of the law to those facts (such as whether the act found by the court to have occurred fits a legal definition at issue).

If the appellate court finds no defect, it &quot;affirms&quot; the judgment.  If the appellate court does find a legal defect in the decision &quot;below&quot; (i.e., in the lower court), it may &quot;modify&quot; the ruling to correct the defect, or it may nullify (&quot;reverse&quot; or &quot;vacate&quot;) the whole decision or any part of it.  It may, in addition, send the case back (&quot;remand&quot; or &quot;remit&quot;) to the lower court for further proceedings to remedy the defect.

In some cases, an appellate court may review a lower court decision &quot;de novo&quot; (or completely), challenging even the lower court's findings of fact.  This might be the proper standard of review, for example, if the lower court resolved the case by granting a pre-trial [[motion to dismiss]] or motion for [[summary judgment]] which is usually based only upon written submissions to the trial court and not on any trial testimony.

Another situation is where appeal is by way of &quot;re-hearing&quot;. Certain jurisdictions permit certain appeals to cause the trial to be heard afresh in the appellate court.

Sometimes, the appellate court finds a defect in the procedure the parties used in filing the appeal and dismisses the appeal without considering its merits, which has the same effect as affirming the judgment below.  (This would happen, for example, if the appellant waited too long, under the appellate court's rules, to file the appeal.)

Generally, there is no [[Jury trial|trial]] in an appellate court, only consideration of the record of the evidence presented to the trial court and all the pre-trial and trial court proceedings are reviewed—unless the appeal is by way of re-hearing, new evidence will usually only be considered on appeal in &quot;very&quot; rare instances, for example if that material evidence was unavailable to a party for some very significant reason such as [[prosecutorial misconduct]].

In some systems, an appellate court will only consider the written decision of the lower court, together with any written evidence that was before that court and is relevant to the appeal. In other systems, the appellate court will normally consider the record of the lower court. In those cases the record will first be certified by the lower court.

The appellant has the opportunity to present arguments for the granting of the appeal and the appellee (or respondent) can present arguments against it.  Arguments of the parties to the appeal are presented through their appellate lawyers, if represented, or &quot;[[pro se]]&quot; if the party has not engaged legal representation.  Those arguments are presented in written [[brief (law)|briefs]] and sometimes in [[oral argument]] to the court at a [[hearing (law)|hearing]]. At such hearings each party is allowed a brief presentation at which the appellate judges ask questions based on their review of the record below and the submitted briefs.

In an [[adversarial system]], appellate courts do not have the power to review lower court decisions unless a party appeals it. Therefore, if a lower court has ruled in an improper manner, or against [[Precedent|legal precedent]], that judgment will stand if not appealed – even if it might have been overturned on appeal.

The United States legal system generally recognizes two types of appeals: a trial &quot;de novo&quot; or an appeal on the record.

A [[trial de novo]] is usually available for review of informal proceedings conducted by some minor judicial tribunals in proceedings that do not provide all the procedural attributes of a formal judicial [[trial (law)|trial]].  If unchallenged, these decisions have the power to settle more minor legal disputes once and for all.  If a party is dissatisfied with the finding of such a tribunal, one generally has the power to request a trial &quot;de novo&quot; by a [[court of record]].  In such a proceeding, all issues and [[evidence (law)|evidence]] may be developed newly, as though never heard before, and one is not restricted to the evidence heard in the lower proceeding.  Sometimes, however, the decision of the lower proceeding is itself admissible as evidence, thus helping to curb frivolous appeals.

In some cases, an application for &quot;trial de novo&quot; effectively erases the prior trial as if it had never taken place.  The Supreme Court of Virginia has stated that '&quot;This Court has repeatedly held that the effect of an appeal to circuit court is to &quot;annul the judgment of the inferior tribunal as completely as if there had been no previous trial.&quot;'&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Gaskill v. Commonwealth&quot;, 206 Va. 486, 490, 144 S.E.2d 293, 296 (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;  The only exception to this is that if a defendant appeals a conviction for a crime having multiple levels of offenses, where they are convicted on a lesser offense, the appeal is of the lesser offense; the conviction represents an acquittal of the more serious offenses. &quot;[A] trial on the same charges in the circuit court does not violate double jeopardy principles, . . . subject only to the limitation that conviction in [the] district court for an offense lesser included in the one charged constitutes an acquittal of the greater offense,
permitting trial de novo in the circuit court only for the lesser-included offense.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Kenyon v. Commonwealth&quot;, 37 Va. App. 668, 673, 561 S.E.2d 17, 19–20&lt;/ref&gt;

In an appeal on the record from a decision in a judicial proceeding, both appellant and respondent are bound to base their arguments wholly on the proceedings and body of evidence as they were presented in the lower tribunal.  Each seeks to prove to the higher court that the result they desired was the just result.  [[Precedent]] and [[case law]] figure prominently in the arguments.  In order for the appeal to succeed, the appellant must prove that the lower court committed [[reversible error]], that is, an impermissible action by the court acted to cause a result that was unjust, and which would not have resulted had the court acted properly.  Some examples of reversible error would be erroneously instructing the jury on the law applicable to the case, permitting seriously [[improper argument]] by an attorney, admitting or excluding evidence improperly, acting outside the court's jurisdiction, injecting bias into the proceeding or appearing to do so, juror misconduct, etc.  The failure to formally object at the time, to what one views as improper action in the lower court, may result in the affirmance of the lower court's judgment on the grounds that one did not &quot;preserve the issue for appeal&quot; by objecting.

In cases where a judge rather than a jury decided issues of fact, an appellate court will apply an &quot;abuse of discretion&quot; standard of review. Under this standard, the appellate court gives deference to the lower court's view of the evidence, and reverses its decision only if it were a clear abuse of discretion. This is usually defined as a decision outside the bounds of reasonableness.  On the other hand, the appellate court normally gives less deference to a lower court's decision on issues of law, and may reverse if it finds that the lower court applied the wrong legal standard.

In some cases, an appellant may successfully argue that the law under which the lower decision was rendered was [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] or otherwise invalid, or may convince the higher court to order a new trial on the basis that evidence earlier sought was concealed or only recently discovered.  In the case of new evidence, there must be a high probability that its presence or absence would have made a material difference in the trial.  Another issue suitable for appeal in criminal cases is effective assistance of counsel. If a defendant has been convicted and can prove that his lawyer did not adequately handle his case and that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different had the lawyer given competent representation, he is entitled to a new trial.

A lawyer traditionally starts an oral argument to any appellate court with the words &quot;May it please the court.&quot;

After an appeal is heard, the &quot;mandate&quot; is a formal notice of a decision by a court of appeal; this notice is transmitted to the trial court and, when filed by the [[Court clerk|clerk]] of the trial court, constitutes the final judgment on the case, unless the appeal court has directed further proceedings in the trial court. The mandate is distinguished from the appeal court's [[court opinion|opinion]], which sets out the legal reasoning for its decision. In some jurisdictions the mandate is known as the &quot;remittitur&quot;.

==Results==
The result of an appeal can be:
:*&lt;span id=&quot;Affirmed&quot;&gt;Affirmed&lt;/span&gt;: Where the reviewing court basically agrees with the result of the lower courts ruling(s). 
:*&lt;span id=&quot;Reversed&quot;&gt;Reversed&lt;/span&gt;: Where the reviewing court basically disagrees with the result of the lower courts ruling(s), and overturns their decision.
:*&lt;span id=&quot;Remanded&quot;&gt;Remanded&lt;/span&gt;: Where the reviewing court sends the case back to the lower court.

There can be multiple outcomes, so that the reviewing court can affirm some rulings, reverse others and remand the case all at the same time. Remand is not required where there is nothing left to do in the case.  &quot;Generally speaking, an appellate court's judgment provides 'the final directive of the appeals courts as to the matter appealed, setting out with specificity the court's determination that the action appealed from should be affirmed, reversed, remanded or modified'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;State v. Randolph, 210 N.J. 330, 350 n.5 (2012), citing Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books), chapter 28:2&lt;/ref&gt;

Some reviewing courts who have discretionary review may send a case back without comment other than ''review improvidently granted''. In other words, after looking at the case, they chose not to say anything.  The result for the case of ''review improvidently granted'' is effectively the same as affirmed, but without that extra higher court stamp of approval.

{{Civil procedure (United States)}}
Generally, an '''answer''' is a reply to a [[question]] or is a solution, a retaliation, or a response that is relevant to the said question.

In law, an '''answer''' was originally a solemn assertion in opposition to someone or something, and thus generally any counter-statement or [[defense (legal)|defense]], a [[reply]] to a [[question]] or response, or [[objection (law)|objection]], or a correct solution of a problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Anonymous|1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[common law]], an '''answer''' is the first [[pleading]] by a [[defendant]], usually filed and served upon the [[plaintiff]] within a certain strict time limit after a civil [[complaint]] or criminal [[information]] or [[indictment]] has been served upon the defendant.  It may have been preceded by an ''optional'' &quot;pre-answer&quot; [[motion to dismiss]] or [[demurrer]]; if such a motion is unsuccessful, the defendant ''must'' file an answer to the complaint or risk an adverse [[default judgment]].

In a criminal case, there is usually an arraignment or some other kind of appearance before the defendant comes to court.  The pleading in the criminal case, which is entered on the record in open court, is usually either [[guilt (law)|guilt]]y or not guilty. Generally speaking in private, civil cases there is no plea entered of guilt or innocence. There is only a judgment that grants money damages or some other kind of [[equitable remedy]] such as [[restitution]] or a permanent [[injunction]]. Criminal cases may lead to [[Fine (penalty)|fine]]s or other [[punishment]], such as [[imprisonment]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

The famous Latin ''Responsa Prudentium'' (&quot;answers of the learned ones&quot;) were the accumulated views of many successive generations of Roman [[lawyer]]s, a body of legal opinion which gradually became authoritative.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

In music an &quot;'''answer'''&quot; (also known as [[countersubject]]) is the technical name in counterpoint for the repetition or modification by one part or instrument of a theme proposed by another.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

An '''appellate court''', commonly called an '''''appeals court''''' or '''''court of appeals''''' ([[American English]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/court%20of%20appeals |title=Court of appeals|publisher=Education.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''appeal court''''' ([[British English]]) or '''''court of second instance''''' or '''''second instance court''''', is any [[court of law]] that is empowered to hear an [[appeal]] of a [[trial court]] or other lower [[tribunal]]. In most [[jurisdiction]]s, the court system is divided into at least three levels: the trial court, which initially hears cases and reviews evidence and testimony to determine the facts of the case; at least one intermediate appellate court; and a [[supreme court]] (or court of last resort) which primarily reviews the decisions of the intermediate courts. A jurisdiction's supreme court is that jurisdiction's highest appellate court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/supreme-court |title=Supreme Court |publisher=Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved October 26, 2012 from CollinsDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appellate courts nationwide can operate by varying rules.

The authority of appellate courts to review decisions of lower courts varies widely from one jurisdiction to another. In some places, the appellate court has limited powers of review.  &quot;Generally speaking, an appellate court's judgment provides 'the final directive of the appeals courts as to the matter appealed, setting out with specificity the court's determination that the action appealed from should be affirmed, reversed, remanded or modified'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;State v. Randolph, 210 N.J. 330, 350 n.5 (2012), citing Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books 2012), chapter 28:2&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==
{{main|United States Supreme Court|United States courts of appeals}}
In the [[United States]], both state and [[United States courts of appeals|federal]] appellate courts are usually restricted to examining whether the lower court made the correct legal determinations, rather than hearing direct evidence and determining what the facts of the case were. Furthermore, U.S. appellate courts are usually restricted to hearing appeals based on matters that were originally brought up before the trial court. Hence, such an appellate court will not consider an appellant's argument if it is based on a theory that is raised for the first time in the appeal.

In most U.S. states, and in U.S. federal courts, parties before the court are allowed one appeal as of right. This means that a party who is unsatisfied with the outcome of a trial may bring an appeal to contest that outcome. However, appeals may be costly, and the appellate court must find an error on the part of the court below that justifies upsetting the verdict. Therefore, only a small proportion of trial court decisions result in appeals. Some appellate courts, particularly supreme courts, have the power of [[discretionary review]], meaning that they can decide whether they will hear an appeal brought in a particular case.

===Institutional titles===
Many U.S. jurisdictions title their appellate court a '''''court of appeal''''' or '''''court of appeals'''''.&lt;ref&gt;The term ''court of appeals'' is not capitalized in carefully edited texts such as reference works, for example [http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Court+of+Appeal West's Encyclopedia of American Law] unless referring to a specific court or courts, but many legal professionals do not comply with this most common English usage shown in major dictionaries and instead capitalize this and many other legal texts.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, others have titled their appellate court a '''''court of errors''''' (or '''''court of errors and appeals'''''), on the premise that it was intended to correct errors made by lower courts. Examples of such courts include the [[New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals]] (which existed from 1844 to 1947), the Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors (which has been renamed the [[Connecticut Supreme Court]]), the Kentucky Court of Errors (renamed the [[Kentucky Supreme Court]]), and the Mississippi High Court of Errors and Appeals (since renamed the [[Supreme Court of Mississippi]]). In some jurisdictions, courts able to hear appeals are known as an '''appellate division'''.

The phrase &quot;court of appeals&quot; most often refers to intermediate appellate courts.  However, the New York system is different: the &quot;[[New York Court of Appeals]]&quot; is the highest appellate court; and the phrase &quot;[[New York Supreme Court]]&quot; applies to the trial court of general jurisdiction.

Depending on the system, certain courts may serve as both trial courts and appellate courts, hearing appeals of decisions made by courts with more limited jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions have specialized appellate courts, such as the [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]], which only hears appeals raised in criminal cases, and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]], which has general jurisdiction but derives most of its caseload from patent cases, on one hand, and appeals from the [[Court of Federal Claims]] on the other.

'''Arraignment''' is a formal reading of a [[crime|criminal]] charging document in the presence of the [[defendant]] to inform the defendant of the charges against him or her. In response to arraignment, the accused is expected to enter a [[plea]]. Acceptable pleas vary among jurisdictions, but they generally include &quot;guilty&quot;, &quot;not guilty&quot;, and the [[peremptory pleas]] (or pleas in bar) setting out reasons why a trial cannot proceed. Pleas of &quot;[[nolo contendere]]&quot; (no contest) and the &quot;[[Alford plea|''Alford'' plea]]&quot; are allowed in some circumstances.

In England, Wales, [[Northern Ireland]] and Australia, arraignment is the first of eleven stages in a criminal trial, and involves the [[court clerk|clerk]] of the [[court]] reading out the [[indictment]]. In every province in Canada except British Columbia, a defendant is arraigned on the day of their trial.  In British Columbia, arraignment takes places in one of the first few court appearances by the defendant or their lawyer. The defendant is asked whether he or she pleads guilty or not guilty to each charge.

In federal courts of the United States, arraignment takes place in two stages. The first is called the '''initial arraignment''' and must take place within 48 hours of an individual's arrest, 72 hours if the individual was arrested on the weekend and not able to go before a judge until Monday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Criminal Procedure |publisher=Thomson Wadsworth |year=2012 |edition=8th |first=Joel |last=Samaha |isbn=978-0-495-91335-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this arraignment the defendant is informed of the pending legal charges and is informed of his or her right to retain counsel. The presiding judge also decides at what amount, if any, to set [[bail]]. During the second arraignment, a '''post-indictment arraignment''' or '''PIA''', the defendant is allowed to enter a plea.

==Form of the arraignment==
The wording of the arraignment varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;In some jurisdictions the wording of the arraignment is set by statute or court practice direction.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it generally conforms with the following principles:
# The accused person ([[defendant]]) is addressed by [[name]];
# The [[criminal charge|charge]] against the accused person is read, including the alleged date, time, and place of offense (and sometimes the names of the state's witnesses and the range of punishment for the charge(s)); and,
# The accused person is asked formally how he or she [[plea]]ds.

==Video arraignment==
'''Video arraignment''' is the act of conducting the arraignment process using some form of [[videoconferencing]] technology. Use of video arraignment system allows the [[court]]s to conduct the requisite arraignment process without the need to transport the defendant to the [[courtroom]] by using an [[audio-visual]] link between the location where the offender is being held and the courtroom.

Use of the video arraignment process addresses the problems associated with having to transport offenders. The transportation of offenders requires time, puts additional demands on the public safety organizations to provide for the safety of the public, court personnel and for the security of the offender population. It also addresses the rising costs of transportation.

==Guilty and not-guilty pleas==
If the defendant pleads guilty, an [[Preliminary hearing|evidentiary hearing]] usually follows. The court is not required to accept a guilty plea. During the hearing, the judge assesses the offense, the [[mitigating factor]]s, and the defendant's character, and passes [[Sentence (law)|sentence]].

If the defendant pleads [[not guilty (plea)|not guilty]], a date is set for a [[preliminary hearing]] or a [[trial]].

In the past, a defendant who refused to plead (or &quot;stood mute&quot;) was subject to [[peine forte et dure]] ([[Law French]] for &quot;strong and hard punishment&quot;). Today in [[common-law]] jurisdictions, the court enters a plea of not guilty for a defendant who refuses to enter a plea.&lt;ref&gt;In Queensland, Australia, this matter is covered by statute. See s601 of the Queensland [[Criminal Code]].&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale for this is the defendant's [[right to silence]].

==Pre-trial release==
This is also often the stage at which arguments for or against pre-trial release and bail may be made, depending on the alleged crime and jurisdiction.

==United States Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure==
Under the [[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure]], &quot;arraignment shall [...] [consist of an] open [...] reading [of] the [[indictment]] [...] to the defendant [...] and call[] on him to plead thereto. He/she shall be given a copy of the indictment [...] before he/she is called upon to plead.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{frcrp|10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;'''America the Beautiful'''&quot; is an [[United States|American]] [[patriotic song]]. The lyrics were written by [[Katharine Lee Bates]], and the music was composed by church organist and choirmaster [[Samuel A. Ward]].

Bates originally wrote the words as a poem, ''Pikes Peak'', first published in the [[Fourth of July]] edition of the church periodical ''The Congregationalist'' in 1895. At that time, the poem was titled ''America'' for publication.

Ward had originally written the music, ''Materna'', for the hymn ''[[O Mother dear, Jerusalem]]'' in 1882, though it was not first published until 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McKim|first=LindaJo|title=The Presbyterian Hymnal Companion|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kde8yd0INHsC&amp;pg=PA379|page=379|publisher=John Knox Press|location=Louisville, Kentucky|accessdate=2012-06-22|year=1993|isbn=9780664251802}} (McKim notes that Ward mailed a friend a postcard in which he stated the hymn had been composed in 1882, however).&lt;/ref&gt; Ward's music combined with the Bates poem was first published in 1910 and titled ''America the Beautiful''.

The song is one of the most popular of the many American patriotic songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/loc.natlib.ihas.100010615/full.html |title=Materna (O Mother Dear, Jerusalem) / Samuel Augustus Ward [hymnal&amp;#93;:Print Material Full Description: Performing Arts Encyclopedia, Library of Congress |publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov |date=2007-10-30 |accessdate=2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Americathebeautiful.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Commemoration plaque atop [[Pikes Peak]] in July 1999.]]
In 1893, at the age of thirty-six, Bates, an English professor at [[Wellesley College]], had taken a train trip to [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], Colorado, to teach a short summer school session at [[Colorado College]]. Several of the sights on her trip inspired her, and they found their way into her poem, including the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]], the &quot;White City&quot; with its promise of the future contained within its alabaster buildings; the wheat fields of America's heartland [[Kansas]], through which her train was riding on July 16; and the majestic view of the [[Great Plains]] from high atop Zebulon's [[Pikes Peak]].

On the pinnacle of that mountain, the words of the poem started to come to her, and she wrote them down upon returning to her hotel room at the original Antlers Hotel. The poem was initially published two years later in ''The Congregationalist,'' to commemorate the Fourth of July. It quickly caught the public's fancy. Amended versions were published in 1904 and 1913.

Several existing pieces of music were adapted to the poem. A [[hymn tune]] composed by Samuel A. Ward was generally considered the best music as early as 1910 and is still the popular tune today. Just as Bates had been inspired to write her poem, Ward too was inspired to compose his tune. The tune came to him while he was on a ferryboat trip from [[Coney Island]] back to his home in [[New York City]], after a leisurely summer day in 1882, and he immediately wrote it down. He was so anxious to capture the tune in his head, he asked fellow passenger friend Harry Martin for his shirt cuff to write the tune on. He composed the tune for the old hymn &quot;O Mother Dear, Jerusalem&quot;, retitling the work &quot;Materna&quot;. Ward's music combined with Bates' poem were first published together in 1910 and titled, ''America the Beautiful''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ward died in 1903, not knowing the national stature his music would attain, as the music was only first applied to the song in 1904. Bates was more fortunate, as the song's popularity was well established by the time of her death in 1929.

At various times in the more than 100 years that have elapsed since the song was written, particularly during the [[John F. Kennedy]] administration, there have been efforts to give &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; legal status either as a national hymn, or as a national anthem equal to, or in place of, &quot;[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]&quot;, but so far this has not succeeded. Proponents prefer &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; for various reasons, saying it is easier to sing, more melodic, and more adaptable to new orchestrations while still remaining as easily recognizable as &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner.&quot; Some prefer &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; over &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; due to the latter's war-oriented imagery. Others prefer &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; for the same reason. While that national dichotomy has stymied any effort at changing the tradition of the national anthem, &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; continues to be held in high esteem by a large number of Americans.

The melody of this song was the [[school song]] of the former [[University of Shanghai]], which closed in 1952. Currently, it is used by [[Shanghai Alumni Primary School]] in [[Hong Kong]] and Hujiang High School in [[Taiwan]] as the melody of their school song.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

At [[Colorado College]], where Bates was teaching at the time of writing it, &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; is commonly sung at events such as convocations, commencement, and baccalaureate, and has become somewhat of a second anthem for the school.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

When [[Richard Nixon]] visited [[China]] in 1972, this song was played as the welcome music.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

This song was used as the background music of the television broadcast of the [[Tiangong-1]] launch.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/30/china-launch-america-the-beautiful&lt;/ref&gt;

The song is often included in songbooks in a wide variety of religious congregations in the United States.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Popular versions==
Three different renditions of the song have entered the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. The first was by [[Charlie Rich]], which went to number 22 in 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitburn&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|page=350|isbn=0-89820-177-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second, by [[Mickey Newbury]], peaked at number 82 in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Whitburn, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; An [[all-star]] version of &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; performed by [[country music|country]] singers [[Trace Adkins]], [[Sherrie Austin]], [[Billy Dean]], [[Vince Gill]], [[Carolyn Dawn Johnson]], [[Toby Keith]], [[Brenda Lee]], [[Lonestar]], [[Lyle Lovett]], [[Lila McCann]], [[Lorrie Morgan]], [[Jamie O'Neal]], [[The Oak Ridge Boys]], [[Collin Raye]], [[Kenny Rogers]], [[Keith Urban]] and [[ Phil Vassar]] reached number 58 in July 2001. The song re-entered the chart following the September 11 terrorist attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Whitburn, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Popularity of the song increased greatly following the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]]; at some sporting events it was sung in addition to the traditional singing of the national anthem.  During the first taping of the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' following the attacks, CBS newsman [[Dan Rather]] cried briefly as he quoted the fourth verse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2001-09-18 |work=Salon.com |title=Dan Rather's tears; Journalists don't cry on camera. That was before last week. |url=http://archive.salon.com/ent/tv/feature/2001/09/18/rather/index.html |first=Stephanie |last=Zacharek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cedarmont Kids]] covered the song on their album &quot;Songs Of America.&quot;

==Idioms==
{{unreferenced section|date = November 2013}}
&quot;From sea to shining sea&quot;, originally used in the charters of some of the English Colonies in North America, is an American [[idiom]] meaning from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]] (or vice versa).  Many songs have used this term, including the American patriotic songs &quot;America, The Beautiful&quot; and &quot;[[God Bless the USA]]&quot;.  In addition to these, it is also featured in [[Schoolhouse Rock]]'s &quot;Elbow Room&quot;.  A term similar to this is the [[Canada|Canadian]] motto ''[[A Mari Usque Ad Mare]]'' (&quot;From sea to sea.&quot;)

&quot;Purple mountain majesties&quot; refers to the shade of the Rocky Mountains, which Kate looked at while writing the poem.

==Books==
[[Lynn Sherr]]'s 2001 book ''America the Beautiful'' discusses the origins of the song and the backgrounds of its authors in depth. The book points out that the poem has the same meter as that of &quot;[[Auld Lang Syne]]&quot;; the songs can be sung interchangeably. Additionally, Sherr points out that this was the original third verse written by Bates:&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherr&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=America the Beautiful: The Stirring True Story Behind Our Nation's Favorite Song |first=Lynn |last=Sherr |publisher=PublicAffairs |location=New York |year=2001 |isbn=978-1-58648-085-1 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HdSmeAv3v-oC&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |page=78 |accessdate=June 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: America! America!
: God shed His grace on thee,
: 'Til selfish gain no longer stain,
: The banner of the free.

Barbara Younger has written a children's book about the writing of the song: ''Purple Mountain Majesties: The Story of Katharine Lee Bates and &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;''. The book has illustrations by artist Stacey Schuett.

This song is also used in Ellen Raskin's ''The Westing Game''.

[[File:Hoergeraet analog 050609.jpg|thumb|250px|Hearing aid]]
'''Assistive Technology''' is an [[umbrella term]] that includes assistive, adaptive, and rehabilitative devices for [[disability|people with disabilities]] and also includes the process used in selecting, locating, and using them. AT promotes greater independence by enabling people to perform tasks that they were formerly unable to accomplish, or had great difficulty accomplishing, by providing enhancements to, or changing methods of interacting with, the [[technology]] needed to accomplish such tasks.

== Assistive Technology and Adaptive Technology ==

The term Adaptive Technology is often used as the [[synonym]] for Assistive Technology, however, they are different terms. Assistive Technology refers to &quot;any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquired commercially, modified, or customized, that is used to increase, maintain, or improve functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities,&quot; while Adaptive Technology covers items that are specifically designed for persons with disabilities and would seldom be used by non-disabled persons. In other words, &quot;Assistive Technology is any object or system that increases or maintains the capabilities of people with disabilities,&quot; while Adaptive Technology is &quot;any object or system that is specifically designed for the purpose of increasing or maintaining the capabilities of people with disabilities.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Tennessee Science Standards | url = http://glencoe.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0078901359/594902/AAT_v4.pdf | accessdate = 2012-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Adaptive Technology is a subset of Assistive Technology. Adaptive Technology often refers specifically to electronic and Information Technology access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Assessing for Adaptive Technology Needs | url = http://dtn.tamu.edu/pdf/pp-assessingAT.ppt | accessdate = 2012-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobility impairment and wheelchairs==
{{Main|Wheelchair}}
[[File:Pride Jazzy Select power chair 001.JPG|thumb|A typical modern battery powered chair.]]
Wheelchairs are devices that can be manually propelled or electrically propelled and that include a seating system and are designed to be a substitute for the normal mobility that most people enjoy. Wheelchairs and other mobility devices allow people to perform mobility related [[Activities of Daily Living]] which include feeding, toileting, dressing grooming and bathing. The devices comes in a number of variations where they can be propelled either by hand or by motors where the occupant uses electrical controls to manage motors and seating control actuators through a joystick or other input devices. Often there are handles behind the seat for someone else to do the pushing or input devices for caregivers. Wheelchairs are used by people for whom [[walking]] is difficult or impossible due to illness, injury, or disability. People with both sitting and walking disability often need to use a wheelchair or walker.

==Mobility impairment and walkers==
{{Main|Walker (mobility)|l1=Walker}}

A [[walker (mobility)|walker]] or walking frame or Rollator is a tool for disabled people who need additional support to maintain balance or stability while walking. It consists of a frame that is about waist high, approximately twelve inches deep and slightly wider than the user. Walkers are also available in other sizes, such as for children, or for heavy people. Modern walkers are height-adjustable. The front two legs of the walker may or may not have wheels attached depending on the strength and abilities of the person using it. It is also common to see caster wheels or glides on the back legs of a walker with wheels on the front.&lt;ref&gt;C. Barrué. Personalization and Shared Autonomy in Assistive Technologies. Ph. Thesis. Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal Emergency Response Systems==
{{Main|Personal Emergency Response Systems|Telecare}}
[[File:Head-wand.jpg|thumb|This voter with a manual dexterity disability is making choices on a touchscreen with a head dauber.]]
[[Personal Emergency Response Systems]] (PERS), or [[Telecare]] (UK term), are a particular sort of Assistive Technology that use electronic sensors connected to an alarm system to help caregivers manage risk and help vulnerable people stay independent at home longer. An example would be the systems being put in place for senior people such as fall detectors, thermometers (for [[hypothermia]] risk), flooding and unlit gas sensors (for people with mild [[dementia]]). Notably, these alerts can be customized to the particular person's risks. When the alert is triggered, a message is sent to a caregiver or contact center who can respond appropriately.

==Accessibility software==
{{Main|Computer accessibility}}

In human–computer interaction, computer accessibility (also known as Accessible computing) refers to the accessibility of a computer system to all people, regardless of disability or severity of impairment, examples include [[Web accessibility]] guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learningdisabilities.org.uk/page.cfm?pagecode=ISSIWD Web accessibility guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach is for the user to present a token to the computer terminal, such as a smart card, that has configuration information to adjust the computer speed, text size, etc. to their particular needs. This is useful where users want to access public computer based terminals in Libraries, ATM, Information kiosks etc. The concept is encompassed by the CEN EN 1332-4 Identification Card Systems - Man-Machine Interface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cen.eu/cen/Sectors/TechnicalCommitteesWorkshops/CENTechnicalCommittees/Pages/TCStruc.aspx?param=6205&amp;title=Personal%20identification,%20electronic%20signature%20and%20cards%20and%20their%20related%20systems%20and%20operations CEN EN 1332-4 Identification Card Systems - Man-Machine Interface]&lt;/ref&gt; This development of this standard has been supported in Europe by [[SNAPI]] and has been successfully incorporated into the [[Lasseo]] specifications, but with limited success due to the lack of interest from public computer terminal suppliers.

==Assistive Technology for visual impairment==
{{Main|Blindness#Management}}
Many people with serious visual impairments live independently, using a wide range of tools and techniques.  Examples of Assistive Technology for visually impairment include the [[Canadian currency tactile feature]], which a system of raised dots in one corner, based on Braille cells but not standard [[Braille]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/banknotes/accessibility.html Accessibility features - Bank Notes - Bank of Canada]{{dead link|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For general computer use access technology such as [[screen reader]]s, [[screen magnifier]]s and [[refreshable Braille display]]s has been widely taken up along with  standalone reading aids that integrate a scanner, optical character recognition (OCR) software, and speech software in a single machine. These function together without a separate PC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Augmentative and alternative communication==
{{Main|Augmentative and alternative communication}}
[[File:AAC user using eye gaze.JPG|right|thumb|An AAC user uses number coding on an eye gaze communication board]]

'''Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC)''' is an umbrella term that encompasses methods of communication for those with impairments or restrictions on the production or comprehension of spoken or written language.&lt;ref name=asha2005&gt;[[#refASHA2005|ASHA (2005)]].&lt;/ref&gt; AAC systems are extremely diverse and depend on the capabilities of the user. They may be as basic as pictures on a board that the are used to request food, drink, or other care; or they can be advanced [[speech generating device]]s, based on speech synthesis, that are capable of storing hundreds of phrases and words.&lt;ref name=&quot;GillamMarquardt2000&quot;&gt;[[#refGillamMarqardt2000|Gilliam &amp; Marquardt]], pp. 356–359.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neuropsychological Rehabilitation, 14, 5-39.&lt;/ref&gt; is the use of technology (usually high tech) to augment and assistive cognitive processes such as attention, memory, self-regulation, navigation, emotion recognition and management, planning, and sequencing activity. Systematic reviews of the field have found that the number of ATC are growing rapidly, but have focused on memory and planning, that there is emerging evidence for efficacy, that a lot of scope exists to develop new ATC.&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, A., Best, C. &amp; O'Neill, B.

==Prosthesis==
{{main|Prosthesis}}
A '''prosthesis''', '''prosthetic''', or '''prosthetic limb'''  is a device that replaces a missing [[Human body|body]] part. It is part of the field of [[biomechatronics]], the science of using [[Mechanical system|mechanical]] devices with human [[muscle]], [[skeleton]], and [[nervous systems]] to assist or enhance motor control lost by [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]], [[disease]], or [[Congenital disorder|defect]]. Prostheses are typically used to replace parts lost by injury (traumatic) or missing from birth ([[congenital]]) or to supplement defective body parts. Inside the body, [[artificial heart valve]]s are in common use with artificial [[artificial heart|heart]]s and [[artificial lung|lungs]] seeing less common use but under active technology development. Other medical devices and aids that can be considered prosthetics include [[hearing aids]], [[visual prosthesis|artificial eyes]], [[palatal obturator]], [[Adjustable gastric band|gastric bands]], and [[dentures]].

Prostheses are specifically ''not'' orthoses, although given certain circumstances a prosthesis might end up performing some or all of the same functionary benefits as an orthosis.  Prostheses are technically the complete finished item.  For instance, a C-Leg knee alone is ''not'' a prosthesis, but only a prosthetic ''component''. The complete prosthesis would consist of the attachment system&amp;nbsp; to the residual limb — usually a &quot;socket&quot;, and all the attachment hardware components all the way down to and including the terminal device. Keep this in mind as nomenclature is often interchanged.

It should be noted that the terms &quot;prosthetic&quot; and &quot;orthotic&quot; are adjectives used to describe devices such as a prosthetic knee.  The terms &quot;prosthetics&quot; and &quot;orthotics&quot; are used to describe the respective allied health fields.  The devices themselves are properly referred to as &quot;prostheses&quot; and &quot;orthoses&quot; in the plural and &quot;prosthesis&quot; and &quot;orthosis&quot; in the singular.

==Assistive Technology and sports==

[[File:NYC Marathon wheelchair.jpg|thumb|A [[New York City Marathon]] competitor uses a racing wheelchair.]]
Assistive Technology and sports is an area of technology design that is growing. Assistive Technology is the array of new devices created to  enable sports enthusiasts who have disabilities to play. Assistive Technology may be used in [[adaptive sports]], where an existing sport is modified to enable players with a disability to participate; or, Assistive Technology may be used to invent completely new sports with athletes with disabilities exclusively in mind.

An increasing number of people with disabilities are participating in sports, leading to the development of new Assistive Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scherer, Marcia and Stefano Federici|title=Assistive Technology Assessment Handbook|year=2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781439838655|page=425}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assistive Technology devices can be simple, or &quot;low-tech&quot;, or they may use highly advanced technology, with some even using computers. Assistive technology for sports may also be simple, or advanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Assistive technologies|url=http://www.understandingdisability.org/AssistiveTechnologies|publisher=Spaulding Framingham|accessdate=September 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, Assistive Technology can be found in sports ranging from local community recreation to elite Paralympic games. More complex Assistive Technology devices have been developed over time, and as a result, sports for people with disabilities &quot;have changed from being a clinical therapeutic tool to an increasingly competition-oriented activity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scherer, Marcia and Stefano Federici|title=Assistive Technology Assessment Handbook|year=2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781439838655|page=427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer accessibility==
{{Main|Computer accessibility}}
[[File:Sip-and-puff device.jpg|thumb|This is a [[sip-and-puff]] device which allows a person with substantial disability to make selections and navigate computerized interfaces by controlling inhalations and exhalations.]]

One of the largest problems that affect patients with disabilities is discomfort with prosthesis.&lt;ref name=hussein&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abdullah|first=Hussein A.|author2=Tarry, Cole|author3=Datta, Rahul.|author4=Mittal, Gauri S.|author5=Abderrahim, Mohamed|title=Dynamic Biomechanical Model for Assessing and Monitoring Robot-Assisted Upper-Limb Therapy|journal=Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development|year=2007|volume=44|issue=1|pages=43–62|doi=10.1682/JRRD.2006.03.0025|pmid=17551857}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A new computer program is used to create the most comfortable and useful prosthetics.  An experiment performed in Massachusetts utilized 20 patients with various sensors attached to their arms.&lt;ref name=hussein /&gt;  The patients tried different arm exercises, and the sensors recorded their movements. All of the data helped engineers develop new engineering concepts that for prosthetics.&lt;ref name=hussein /&gt;

Alternatively, Assistive Technology may attempt to improve the ergonomics of the devices themselves such as  [[Dvorak Simplified Keyboard|Dvorak]] and other alternative layouts, which offer more ergonomic layouts of the keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chubon, R.A., Hester, M.R. |title=An enhanced standard computer keyboard system for single-finger and typing-stick typing |journal=[[Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development]] |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=17–24 |year=1988 |pmid=2973523 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anson, D., George, S., Galup, R., Shea, B., Vetter, R. |title=Efficiency of the Chubon versus the QWERTY keyboard |journal=Assistive-Technology |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=40–5 |year=2001 |pmid=12212435 |doi=10.1080/10400435.2001.10132032 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assistive Technology devices have now been created to enable patients with disabilities to use modern touch screen mobile computers such as  the [[iPad]], [[iPhone]] and [[iPod touch]]. The Pererro is a plug and play adapter for [[iOS]] devices which uses the built in [[Apple VoiceOver]] feature in combination with a basic switch. This brings touch screen technology to those who were previously unable to use it.

==Home automation for the elderly and disabled==
The form of [[home automation]] called '''assistive domotics''' focuses on making it possible for the [[elderly]] and [[disabled]] to remain at home, safe and comfortable. Home automation is becoming a viable option for the elderly and disabled who would prefer to stay in the comfort of their homes rather than move to a healthcare facility. This field uses much of the same technology and equipment as home automation for security, entertainment, and energy conservation but tailors it towards the elderly and disabled.

While talking about technology, Microsoft Corporation’s C.E.O. [[Steve Ballmer]] once said, “The number one benefit of technology is that it empowers people to do what they want to do. It lets people be creative. It lets people be productive. It lets people learn things they didn't think they could learn before, and so in a sense it is all about potential” (BrainyQuote 2007).  Similarly, through new technology, a little creativity, and a lot of thinking, we have begun to produce home automation systems that make it possible for the elderly and disabled to live by themselves and meet their potential.  Due to the aging population of the United States, measures must be taken in order to provide health care to the elderly.  The US Census Bureau has projected that by 2010 13% of the population will be 65 or older (Cheek 2005).  The bureau has also projected that by 2030 there will be 9 million Americans older than 85 (Cheek 2005).  The aging population has generated a significant interest by the government, as well as industry leaders, to develop home automation systems for the elderly.  Due to the drastic increases in health-care facility costs, more and more elderly people are turning to home automation, a concept also known as &quot;smart homes&quot;, to allow them to age in the comfort of their own homes.  These systems make normal Activities of Daily Living (ADL) possible for the elderly and disabled who would otherwise not be able to live on their own.  Smart homes can most easily be described as “a collective term for information and communication technology in homes where components communicate through a local network” (Cheek 2005).

There are two basic forms of home automation systems for the elderly: ''embedded health systems'' and ''private health networks''.  Embedded health systems integrate sensors and microprocessors in appliances, furniture, and clothing which collect data that is analyzed and can be used to diagnose diseases and recognize risk patterns.  Private health networks implement wireless technology to connect portable devices and store data in a household health database.  Due to the need for more healthcare options for the aging population “there is a significant interest from industry and policy makers in developing these technologies” (Eriksson 2002).

[[File:Boulier1.JPG|right|thumb|A Chinese abacus]]
[[File:Gregor Reisch, Margarita Philosophica, 1508 (1230x1615).png|right|thumb|''Calculating-Table'' by [[Gregor Reisch]]: Margarita Philosophica, 1508. The woodcut shows ''Arithmetica'' instructing an [[algorism|algorist]] and an abacist (inaccurately represented as [[Boethius]] and [[Pythagoras]]). There was keen competition between the two from the introduction of the ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing|Algebra]]'' into Europe in the 12th century until its triumph in the 16th.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Carl B.; Merzbach, Uta C. (1991); pp. 252-253&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''abacus''' (''plural'' abaci or abacuses), also called a '''counting frame''', is a calculating tool that was in use centuries before the adoption of the written modern numeral system and is still widely used by merchants, traders and clerks in [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and elsewhere. Today, abaci are often constructed as a bamboo frame with beads sliding on wires, but originally they were beans or stones moved in grooves in sand or on tablets of wood, stone, or metal. The user of an abacus is called an ''abacist''.&lt;ref&gt;Gove, Philip Babcock (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The use of the word ''abacus'' dates before 1387 AD, when a [[Middle English]] work borrowed the word from [[Latin]] to describe a sandboard abacus. The Latin word came from [[Greek language|Greek]] ἄβαξ ''abax'' &quot;board strewn with sand or dust used for drawing geometric figures or calculating&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ptolemaeus Gramm., De differentia vocabulorum (= Περὶ διαφορᾶς λέξεων) [Sp.] (e codd. Ottobon. gr. 43 + Vat. gr. 197)
Page 392, line 26

&lt;ἄβαξ&gt; καὶ &lt;ἀβάκιον&gt; διαφέρει· ἄβαξ μὲν γὰρ λέγεται ἐφ' οὗ
παρατιθέασι τὰ πράγματα· ἀβάκιον δὲ ἐφ' οὗ ψηφίζουσιν.&lt;/ref&gt; (the exact shape of the Latin perhaps reflects the [[Genitive case|genitive form]] of the Greek word, ἄβακoς ''abakos''). Greek ἄβαξ itself is probably a borrowing of a [[Northwest Semitic]], perhaps [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]], word akin to [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''ʾābāq'' (אבק), &quot;dust&quot; (since dust strewn on wooden boards to draw figures in).&lt;ref name=&quot;Etymology&quot;&gt;Huehnergard, John (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The preferred plural of ''abacus'' is a subject of disagreement, with both ''abacuses''&lt;ref name = SOED&gt;Brown, Lesley (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''abaci''&lt;ref name = SOED/&gt; in use.

==History==

===Mesopotamian===
The period 2700–2300 BC saw the first appearance of the [[Sumer]]ian abacus, a table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude of their [[sexagesimal]] number system.&lt;ref&gt;Ifrah, Georges (2001); p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars point to a character from the [[Babylon]]ian [[cuneiform]] which may have been derived from a representation of the abacus.&lt;ref&gt;Crump, Thomas (1992); p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; It is the belief of Old Babylonian&lt;ref&gt;Melville, Duncan J. (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; scholars such as Carruccio that Old Babylonians &quot;may have used the abacus for the operations of [[addition]] and [[subtraction]]; however, this primitive device proved difficult to use for more complex calculations&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Carruccio, Ettore (2006); p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egyptian===
The use of the abacus in [[Ancient Egypt]] is mentioned by the Greek historian [[Herodotus]], who writes that the Egyptians manipulated the pebbles from right to left, opposite in direction to the Greek left-to-right method. Archaeologists have found ancient disks of various sizes that are thought to have been used as counters. However, wall depictions of this instrument have not been discovered,&lt;ref name=Smith1&gt;Smith, David Eugene (1958); pp. 157–160&lt;/ref&gt; casting some doubt over the extent to which this instrument was used.{{Or|date=December 2010}}

===Persian===
During the [[Achaemenid Persian Empire]], around 600 BC the Persians first began to use the abacus.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Karen (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sassanian]] [[Iran]]ian empires, scholars concentrated on exchanging knowledge and inventions by the countries around them – [[India]], [[China]], and the [[Roman Empire]], when it is thought to be expanded over the other countries.

===Greek===
The earliest archaeological evidence for the use of the Greek abacus dates to the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Ifrah, Georges (2001); p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek abacus was a table of wood or marble, pre-set with small counters in wood or metal for mathematical calculations. This Greek abacus saw use in Achaemenid Persia, the Etruscan civilization, Ancient Rome and, until the French Revolution, the Western Christian world.

A tablet found on the Greek island [[Salamis Island|Salamis]] in 1846 AD (the [[Salamis Tablet]]), dates back to 300 BC, making it the oldest counting board discovered so far. It is a slab of white marble {{convert|149|cm|0|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|75|cm|0|abbr=on}} wide, and {{convert|4.5|cm|0|abbr=on}} thick, on which are 5 groups of markings. In the center of the tablet is a set of 5 parallel lines equally divided by a vertical line, capped with a semicircle at the intersection of the bottom-most horizontal line and the single vertical line. Below these lines is a wide space with a horizontal crack dividing it. Below this crack is another group of eleven parallel lines, again divided into two sections by a line perpendicular to them, but with the semicircle at the top of the intersection; the third, sixth and ninth of these lines are marked with a cross where they intersect with the vertical line.

===Roman===
{{Main|Roman abacus}}
[[File:RomanAbacusRecon.jpg|right|thumb|Copy of a [[Roman abacus]]]]
The normal method of calculation in ancient Rome, as in Greece, was by moving counters on a smooth table. Originally pebbles (''calculi'') were used. Later, and in medieval Europe, [[jeton]]s were manufactured. Marked lines indicated units, fives, tens etc. as in the [[Roman numeral]] system. This system of 'counter casting' continued into the late Roman empire and in medieval Europe, and persisted in limited use into the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Pullan, J. M. (1968); p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Due to [[Pope Sylvester II]]'s reintroduction of the abacus with very useful modifications, it became widely used in Europe once again during the 11th century&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Nancy Marie (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Nancy Marie (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; This abacus used beads on wires; unlike the traditional roman counting boards; which meant the abacus could be used that much faster.&lt;ref&gt;Huff, Toby E. (1993); p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the 1st century BC, Horace refers to the wax abacus, a board covered with a thin layer of black wax on which columns and figures were inscribed using a stylus.&lt;ref name=rome&gt;Ifrah, Georges (2001); p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of archaeological evidence of the [[Roman abacus]], shown here in reconstruction, dates to the 1st century AD. It has eight long grooves containing up to five beads in each and eight shorter grooves having either one or no beads in each. The groove marked I indicates units, X tens, and so on up to millions. The beads in the shorter grooves denote fives –five units, five tens etc., essentially in a [[bi-quinary coded decimal]] system, obviously related to the [[Roman numerals]]. The short grooves on the right may have been used for marking Roman &quot;ounces&quot; (i.e. fractions).

===Chinese===
{{Main|Suanpan}}
[[File:abacus 6.png|thumb|[[Suanpan]] (the number represented in the picture is 6,302,715,408)]]
The earliest known written documentation of the Chinese abacus dates to the 2nd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Ifrah, Georges (2001); p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese abacus, known as the ''suànpán'' (算盤, lit. &quot;Counting tray&quot;), is typically {{convert|20|cm|0|abbr=on}} tall and comes in various widths depending on the operator. It usually has more than seven rods. There are two beads on each rod in the upper deck and five beads each in the bottom for both [[decimal]] and [[hexadecimal]] computation. The beads are usually rounded and made of a [[hardwood]]. The beads are counted by moving them up or down towards the beam. If you move them toward the beam, you count their value. If you move away, you don't count their value.&lt;ref name=&quot;ryerson&quot;&gt;Fernandes, Luis (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; The suanpan can be reset to the starting position instantly by a quick jerk along the horizontal axis to spin all the beads away from the horizontal beam at the center.&lt;ref&gt;Githens, Perry (1948)&lt;/ref&gt;

Suanpans can be used for functions other than counting. Unlike the simple counting board used in elementary schools, very efficient suanpan techniques have been developed to do [[multiplication]], [[division (mathematics)|division]], [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[square root]] and [[cube root]] operations at high speed. There are currently schools teaching students how to use it.

In the famous long scroll ''[[Along the River During the Qingming Festival]]'' painted by [[Zhang Zeduan]] (1085–1145 AD) during the [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1297 AD), a suanpan is clearly seen lying beside an account book and doctor's prescriptions on the counter of an [[apothecary]]'s (Feibao).

The similarity of the [[Roman abacus]] to the Chinese one suggests that one could have inspired the other, as there is some evidence of a trade relationship between the [[Roman Empire]] and China. However, no direct connection can be demonstrated, and the similarity of the abaci may be coincidental, both ultimately arising from counting with five fingers per hand. Where the Roman model (like most modern [[#Japanese abacus|Japanese]]) has 4 plus 1 bead per decimal place, the standard suanpan has 5 plus 2. (Incidentally, this allows use with a [[hexadecimal]] numeral system.) Instead of running on wires as in the Chinese and Japanese models, the beads of Roman model run in grooves, presumably making arithmetic calculations much slower.

Another possible source of the suanpan is Chinese [[counting rods]], which operated with a [[decimal|decimal system]] but lacked the concept of [[0 (number)|zero]] as a place holder. The zero was probably introduced to the Chinese in the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618-907 AD) when travel in the [[Indian Ocean]] and the [[Middle East]] would have provided direct contact with [[India]], allowing them to acquire the concept of zero and the [[decimal point]] from Indian merchants and mathematicians.

===Indian===
First century sources, such as the ''[[Abhidharmakosa]]'' describe the knowledge and use of abacus in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;Stearns, Peter N.; Langer, William Leonard (2001); p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Around the 5th century, Indian clerks were already finding new ways of recording the contents of the Abacus.&lt;ref&gt;Körner, Thomas William (1996); p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu texts used the term ''shunya'' (zero) to indicate the empty column on the abacus.&lt;ref&gt;Mollin, Richard Anthony (1998); p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese===
{{Main|Soroban}}
[[File:Soroban.JPG|thumb|Japanese [[soroban]]]]
In Japanese, the abacus is called ''[[soroban]]'' ({{lang|ja|算盤, そろばん}}, lit. &quot;Counting tray&quot;), imported from China around 1600.&lt;ref name=&quot;fernandes&quot;&gt;Fernandes, Luis (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The 1/4 abacus, which is suited to decimal calculation, appeared circa 1930, and became widespread as the Japanese abandoned hexadecimal weight calculation which was still common in China. The abacus is still manufactured in Japan today even with the proliferation, practicality, and affordability of pocket [[electronic calculator]]s. The use of the soroban is still taught in Japanese [[primary school]]s as part of [[mathematics]], primarily as an aid to faster mental calculation. Using visual imagery of a soroban, one can arrive at the answer in the same time as, or even faster than, is possible with a physical instrument.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Geoffrey (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Korean===
The Chinese abacus migrated from China to [[Korea]] around 1400 AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;thocp&quot;&gt;thocp.net (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Koreans call it ''jupan'' (주판), ''supan'' (수판) or ''jusan'' (주산).&lt;ref&gt;100.daum.net (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Native American===
[[File:Quipu.png|thumb|Representation of an [[Inca]] [[quipu]]]]
[[File:Yupana 1.GIF|thumb|A [[yupana]] as used by the Incas.]]
Some sources mention the use of an abacus called a ''nepohualtzintzin'' in ancient [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] culture. This Mesoamerican abacus used a 5-digit base-20 system.&lt;ref&gt;inaoep.mx (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;
The word Nepōhualtzintzin {{IPA-nah|nepoːwaɬˈt͡sint͡sin|}} comes from the Nahuatl and it is formed by the roots; Ne - personal -; pōhual or pōhualli {{IPA-nah|ˈpoːwalːi|}} - the account -; and tzintzin {{IPA-nah|ˈt͡sint͡sin|}} - small similar elements. And its complete meaning was taken as: counting with small similar elements by somebody. Its use was taught in the ''Calmecac'' {{IPA-nah|kalˈmekak|}} to the ''temalpouhqueh'' {{IPA-nah|temaɬˈpoʍkeʔ|}}, who were students dedicated to take the accounts of skies, from childhood. Unfortunately the Nepōhualtzintzin and its teaching were among the victims of the conquering destruction, when a diabolic origin was attributed to them after observing the tremendous properties of representation, precision and speed of calculations.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

This arithmetic tool was based on the [[vigesimal]] system (base 20).&lt;ref&gt;tux.org (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; For the Aztec the count by 20s was completely natural. The amount of 4, 5, 13, 20 and other cyclees meant cycles.{{clarify|date=January 2011}} The Nepōhualtzintzin was divided in two main parts separated by a bar or intermediate cord. In the left part there were four beads, which in the first row have unitary values (1, 2, 3, and 4), and in the right side there are three beads with values of 5, 10, and 15 respectively. In order to know the value of the respective beads of the upper rows, it is enough to multiply by 20 (by each row), the value of the corresponding account in the first row.

Altogether, there were 13 rows with 7 beads in each one, which made up 91 beads in each Nepōhualtzintzin. This was a basic number to understand, 7 times 13, a close relation conceived between natural phenomena, the underworld and the cycles of the heavens. One Nepōhualtzintzin (91) represented the number of days that a season of the year lasts, two Nepōhualtzitzin (182) is the number of days of the corn's cycle, from its sowing to its harvest, three Nepōhualtzintzin (273) is the number of days of a baby's gestation, and four Nepōhualtzintzin (364) completed a cycle and approximate a year (1{{fraction|1|4}} days short). The Nepōhualtzintzin amounted to the rank from 10 to the 18 in floating point, which calculated stellar as well as infinitesimal amounts with absolute precision, meant that no round off was allowed, when translated into modern computer arithmetic.

The rediscovery of the Nepōhualtzintzin was due to the Mexican engineer David Esparza Hidalgo,&lt;ref&gt;Hidalgo, David Esparza (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; who in his wanderings throughout Mexico found diverse engravings and paintings of this instrument and reconstructed several of them made in gold, jade, encrustations of shell, etc.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} There have also been found very old Nepōhualtzintzin attributed to the [[Olmec]]a culture, and even some bracelets of Mayan origin, as well as a diversity of forms and materials in other cultures.

George I. Sanchez, &quot;Arithmetic in Maya&quot;, Austin-Texas, 1961 found another base 5, base 4 abacus in the Yucatán that also computed calendar data. This was a finger abacus, on one hand 0 1,2, 3, and 4 were used; and on the other hand used 0, 1, 2 and 3 were used. Note the use of zero at the beginning and end of the two cycles. Sanchez worked with [[Sylvanus Morley]], a noted Mayanist.

The [[quipu]] of the [[Inca]]s was a system of knotted cords used to record numerical data, like advanced [[tally stick]]s – but not used to perform calculations. Calculations were carried out using a [[yupana]] ([[Quechua languages|Quechua]] for &quot;counting tool&quot;; see figure) which was still in use after the conquest of Peru. The working principle of a yupana is unknown, but in 2001 an explanation of the mathematical basis of these instruments was proposed by Italian mathematician Nicolino De Pasquale. By comparing the form of several yupanas, researchers found that calculations were based using the [[Fibonacci sequence]] 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and powers of 10, 20 and 40 as place values for the different fields in the instrument. Using the Fibonacci sequence would keep the number of grains within any one field at minimum.&lt;ref&gt;Aimi, Antonio; De Pasquale, Nicolino (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian===
[[File:Schoty abacus.jpg|thumb|Russian abacus]]
The Russian abacus, the ''schoty'' (счёты), usually has a single slanted deck, with ten beads on each wire (except one wire, usually positioned near the user, with four beads for quarter-ruble fractions). Older models have another 4-bead wire for quarter-kopeks, which were minted until 1916. The Russian abacus is often used vertically, with wires from left to right in the manner of a book. The wires are usually bowed to bulge upward in the center, to keep the beads pinned to either of the two sides. It is cleared when all the beads are moved to the right. During manipulation, beads are moved to the left. For easy viewing, the middle 2 beads on each wire (the 5th and 6th bead) usually are of a different colour from the other eight beads. Likewise, the left bead of the thousands wire (and the million wire, if present) may have a different color.

As a simple, cheap and reliable device, the Russian abacus was in use in all shops and markets throughout the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|former Soviet Union]], and the usage of it was taught in most schools until the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Bud, Robert; Warner, Deborah Jean (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hudgins, Sharon (2004); p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; Even the 1874 invention of [[mechanical calculator]], [[Odhner Arithmometer|Odhner arithmometer]], had not replaced them in [[Russia]] and likewise the mass production of Felix arithmometers since 1924 did not significantly reduce their use in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Leushina, A. M. (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; Russian abacus began to lose popularity only after the mass production of [[Pocket calculator|microcalculators]] had started in the Soviet Union in 1974. Today it is regarded as an archaism and replaced by the handheld calculator.

The Russian abacus was brought to France around 1820 by the mathematician [[Jean-Victor Poncelet]], who served in [[Napoleon]]'s army and had been a prisoner of war in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Trogemann, Georg; Ernst, Wolfgang (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; The abacus had fallen out of use in western Europe in the 16th century with the rise of decimal notation and [[algorism]]ic methods. To Poncelet's French contemporaries, it was something new. Poncelet used it, not for any applied purpose, but as a teaching and demonstration aid.&lt;ref&gt;Flegg, Graham (1983); p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

==School abacus==
[[File:Kugleramme.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Early 19th century abacus used in Danish elementary school.]]
Around the world, abaci have been used in pre-schools and elementary schools as an aid in teaching the [[numeral system]] and [[arithmetic]].

In Western countries, a '''bead frame''' similar to the Russian abacus but with straight wires and a vertical frame has been common (see image). It is still often seen as a plastic or wooden toy.

The type of abacus shown here is often used to represent numbers without the use of place value. Each bead and each wire has the same value and used in this way it can represent numbers up to 100.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Uses by the blind==
An adapted abacus, invented by Tim Cranmer, called a '''Cranmer abacus''' is still commonly used by individuals who are [[blindness|blind]]. A piece of soft fabric or rubber is placed behind the beads so that they do not move inadvertently. This keeps the beads in place while the users feel or manipulate them. They use an abacus to perform the mathematical functions [[multiplication]], [[division (mathematics)|division]], [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[square root]] and [[cubic root]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aph&quot;&gt;Terlau, Terrie; Gissoni, Fred (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although blind students have benefited from talking calculators, the abacus is still very often taught to these students in early grades, both in public schools and state schools for the blind. The abacus teaches mathematical skills that can never be replaced with talking calculators and is an important learning tool for blind students.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} Blind students also complete mathematical assignments using a braille-writer and [[Nemeth Braille|Nemeth code]] (a type of braille code for mathematics) but large multiplication and long division problems can be long and difficult. The abacus gives blind and visually impaired students a tool to compute mathematical problems that equals the speed and mathematical knowledge required by their sighted peers using pencil and paper. Many blind people find this number machine a very useful tool throughout life.&lt;ref name=&quot;aph&quot; /&gt;

==Binary abacus==
[[File:Bbinary Abacus 002.jpg|150px|thumb|Two binary abaci constructed by Dr. Robert C. Good, Jr., made from two Chinese abaci]]
The binary abacus is used to explain how computers manipulate numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Good Jr., Robert C. (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; The abacus shows how numbers, letters, and signs can be stored in a binary system on a computer, or via [[ASCII]]. The device consists of a series of beads on parallel wires arranged in three separate rows. The beads represent a switch on the computer in either an 'on' or 'off' position.

{{Acids and bases}}
An '''acid''' (from the [[Latin]] ''acidus/acēre'' meaning ''sour''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/acid Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary: ''acid'']&lt;/ref&gt;) is a chemical substance whose [[aqueous solutions]] are characterized by a sour taste, the ability to turn blue [[litmus]] red, and the ability to react with [[Base (chemistry)|bases]] and certain metals (like [[calcium]]) to form [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]]. Aqueous solutions of acids have a [[pH]] of less than 7. A lower pH means a higher acidity, and thus a higher concentration of [[Hydron (chemistry)|hydrogen ions]] in the [[solution]]. Chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be '''acidic'''.

Common examples of acids include [[hydrochloric acid]] (a solution of [[hydrogen chloride]] which is found in [[gastric acid]] in the stomach and activates [[digestive enzymes]]), [[acetic acid]] ([[vinegar]] is a dilute solution of this liquid), [[sulfuric acid]] (used in [[car battery|car batteries]]), and [[tartaric acid]] (a solid used in baking). As these examples show, acids can be solutions or pure substances, and can be derived from [[solid]]s, [[liquid]]s, or [[gas]]es. [[Acid strength|Strong acid]]s and some concentrated weak acids are [[corrosive substance|corrosive]], but there are exceptions such as [[carborane]]s and [[boric acid]].

There are three common definitions for acids: the [[Acid-base reaction#Arrhenius definition|Arrhenius definition]], the [[Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory|Brønsted-Lowry definition]], and the [[Lewis acids and bases|Lewis definition]]. The Arrhenius definition defines acids as substances which increase the concentration of hydrogen ions (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), or more accurately, [[hydronium ions]] (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), when dissolved in water. The Brønsted-Lowry definition is an expansion: an acid is a substance which can act as a proton donor. By this definition, any compound which can easily be [[deprotonation|deprotonated]] can be considered an acid. Examples include alcohols and amines which contain O-H or N-H fragments. A Lewis acid is a substance that can accept a [[electron pair|pair of electrons]] to form a [[covalent bond]]. Examples of Lewis acids include all metal [[ion|cations]], and electron-deficient molecules such as [[boron trifluoride]] and [[aluminium trichloride]].

==Definitions and concepts==
{{main|Acid–base reaction}}
Modern definitions are concerned with the fundamental chemical reactions common to all acids.

Most acids encountered in everyday life are [[aqueous solutions]], or can be dissolved in water, so the Arrhenius and Brønsted-Lowry definitions are the most relevant.

The Brønsted-Lowry definition is the most widely used definition; unless otherwise specified, acid-base reactions are assumed to involve the transfer of a proton (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) from an acid to a base.

Hydronium ions are acids according to all three definitions. Interestingly, although alcohols and amines can be Brønsted-Lowry acids, they can also function as [[Lewis base]]s due to the lone pairs of electrons on their oxygen and nitrogen atoms.

===Arrhenius acids===
[[File:Arrhenius2.jpg|thumb|150px|Svante Arrhenius]]

The Swedish chemist [[Svante Arrhenius]] attributed the properties of acidity to [[hydron (chemistry)|hydrogen ions]] (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) or [[proton]]s in 1884. An '''Arrhenius acid''' is a substance that, when added to water, increases the concentration of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions in the water. Note that chemists often write H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''aq'') and refer to the [[hydrogen ion]] when describing acid-base reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus, a [[proton]], does not exist alone in water, it exists as the hydronium ion, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus, an Arrhenius acid can also be described as a substance that increases the concentration of hydronium ions when added to water. This definition stems from the equilibrium dissociation of water into hydronium and [[hydroxide]] (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) ions:&lt;ref name=&quot;Ebbing&quot;&gt;Ebbing, D.D., &amp; Gammon, S. D. (2005). ''General chemistry'' (8th ed.). Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin. ISBN 0-618-51177-6&lt;/ref&gt;
: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(''l'') + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(''l'') {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''aq'') + OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(''aq'')
In pure water the majority of molecules are H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, but the molecules are constantly dissociating and re-associating, and at any time a small number of the molecules (always near 1 in 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;) are hydronium and an equal number are hydroxide.  Because the numbers are equal, pure water is neutral (not acidic or basic).

An Arrhenius [[base (chemistry)|base]], on the other hand, is a substance which increases the concentration of hydroxide ions when dissolved in water, hence decreasing the concentration of hydronium.

The constant association and disassociation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules forms an equilibrium in which any increase in the concentration of hydronium is accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of hydroxide, thus an Arrhenius acid could also be said to be one that decreases hydroxide concentration, with an Arrhenius base increasing it.

The reason that pHs of acids are less than 7 is that the concentration of hydronium ions is greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; [[Mole (unit)|moles]] per liter. Since pH is defined as the negative logarithm of the concentration of hydronium ions, acids thus have pHs of less than 7.

===Brønsted-Lowry acids{{anchor|Brønsted acids}}===
{{Main|Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory}}

[[File:Acetic-acid-dissociation-3D-balls.png|thumb|350px|alt=Acetic acid, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH, is composed of a methyl group, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, bound chemically to a carboxylate group, COOH. The carboxylate group can lose a proton and donate it to a water molecule, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0, leaving behind an acetate anion CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO- and creating a hydronium cation H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;. This is an equilibrium reaction, so the reverse process can also take place.|[[Acetic acid]], a [[weak acid]], donates a proton (hydrogen ion, highlighted in green) to water in an equilibrium reaction to give the [[acetate]] ion and the [[hydronium]] ion. Red: oxygen, black: carbon, white: hydrogen.]]

While the Arrhenius concept is useful for describing many reactions, it is also quite limited in its scope. In 1923 chemists [[Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted]] and [[Thomas Martin Lowry]] independently recognized that acid-base reactions involve the transfer of a proton. A '''Brønsted-Lowry acid''' (or simply Brønsted acid) is a species that donates a proton to a Brønsted-Lowry base.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ebbing&quot; /&gt; Brønsted-Lowry acid-base theory has several advantages over Arrhenius theory. Consider the following reactions of [[acetic acid]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH), the [[organic acid]] that gives [[vinegar]] its characteristic taste:

:{{chem|CH|3|COOH}} + {{chem|H|2|O}} {{eqm}} {{chem|CH|3|COO|−}} + {{chem|H|3|O|+}}
:{{chem|CH|3|COOH}} + {{chem|NH|3}} {{eqm}} {{chem|CH|3|COO|−}} + {{chem|NH|4|+}}

Both theories easily describe the first reaction: CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH acts as an Arrhenius acid because it acts as a source of H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; when dissolved in water, and it acts as a Brønsted acid by donating a proton to water. In the second example CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH undergoes the same transformation, in this case donating a proton to ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), but cannot be described using the Arrhenius definition of an acid because the reaction does not produce hydronium.

Brønsted-Lowry theory can also be used to describe [[molecule|molecular compounds]], whereas Arrhenius acids must be [[ion|ionic compounds]]. [[Hydrogen chloride]] (HCl) and ammonia combine under several different conditions to form [[ammonium chloride]], NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl. In aqueous solution HCl behaves as [[hydrochloric acid]] and exists as hydronium and chloride ions. The following reactions illustrate the limitations of Arrhenius's definition:
# H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''aq'') + Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(''aq'') + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(''aq'') + NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''aq'') + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
# HCl(''benzene'') + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''benzene'') → NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl(''s'')
# HCl(''g'') + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') → NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl(''s'')
As with the acetic acid reactions, both definitions work for the first example, where water is the solvent and hydronium ion is formed by the HCl solute. The next two reactions do not involve the formation of ions but are still proton transfer reactions. In the second reaction hydrogen chloride and ammonia (dissolved in [[benzene]]) react to form solid ammonium chloride in a benzene solvent and in the third gaseous HCl and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; combine to form the solid.

===Lewis acids===
A third concept was proposed in 1923 by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] which includes reactions with acid-base characteristics that do not involve a proton transfer. A '''Lewis acid''' is a species that accepts a pair of electrons from another species; in other words, it is an electron pair acceptor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ebbing&quot; /&gt; Brønsted acid-base reactions are proton transfer reactions while Lewis acid-base reactions are electron pair transfers. All [[Brønsted acid]]s are also [[Lewis acid]]s, but not all Lewis acids are Brønsted acids. Contrast the following reactions which could be described in terms of acid-base chemistry.
:[[File:LewisAcid.png|374px]]
In the first reaction a [[fluoride|fluoride ion]], F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, gives up an [[lone pair|electron pair]] to [[boron trifluoride]] to form the product [[tetrafluoroborate]]. Fluoride &quot;loses&quot; a pair of [[valence electron]]s because the electrons shared in the B—F bond are located in the region of space between the two atomic [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] and are therefore more distant from the fluoride nucleus than they are in the lone fluoride ion. BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is a Lewis acid because it accepts the electron pair from fluoride. This reaction cannot be described in terms of Brønsted theory because there is no proton transfer. The second reaction can be described using either theory. A proton is transferred from an unspecified Brønsted acid to ammonia, a Brønsted base; alternatively, ammonia acts as a Lewis base and transfers a lone pair of electrons to form a bond with a hydrogen ion. The species that gains the electron pair is the Lewis acid; for example, the oxygen atom in H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; gains a pair of electrons when one of the H—O bonds is broken and the electrons shared in the bond become localized on oxygen. Depending on the context, a Lewis acid may also be described as an [[Oxidizing agent|oxidizer]] or an [[electrophile]].

==Dissociation and equilibrium==
Reactions of acids are often generalized in the form HA {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, where HA represents the acid and A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[conjugate acid|conjugate base]]. Acid-base conjugate pairs differ by one proton, and can be interconverted by the addition or removal of a proton ([[protonation]] and [[deprotonation]], respectively). Note that the acid can be the charged species and the conjugate base can be neutral in which case the generalized reaction scheme could be written as HA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + A. In solution there exists an [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] between the acid and its conjugate base. The [[equilibrium constant]] ''K'' is an expression of the equilibrium concentrations of the molecules or the ions in solution. Brackets indicate concentration, such that [H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O] means ''the concentration of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O''. The [[acid dissociation constant]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is generally used in the context of acid-base reactions. The numerical value of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to the concentration of the products divided by the concentration of the reactants, where the reactant is the acid (HA) and the products are the conjugate base and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;K_a = \frac{[\mbox{H}^+] [\mbox{A}^-]}{[\mbox{HA}]}&lt;/math&gt;
The stronger of two acids will have a higher ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; than the weaker acid; the ratio of hydrogen ions to acid will be higher for the stronger acid as the stronger acid has a greater tendency to lose its proton. Because the range of possible values for ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; spans many orders of magnitude, a more manageable constant, p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is more frequently used, where p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = -log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;. Stronger acids have a smaller p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; than weaker acids. Experimentally determined p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; at 25&amp;nbsp;°C in aqueous solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference material.

==Nomenclature==
In the classical naming system, acids are named according to their [[anion]]s. That ionic suffix is dropped and replaced with a new suffix (and sometimes prefix), according to the table below.
For example, HCl has [[chloride]] as its anion, so the -ide suffix makes it take the form [[hydrochloric acid]]. In the [[IUPAC]] naming system, &quot;aqueous&quot; is simply added to the name of the ionic compound. Thus, for hydrogen chloride, the IUPAC name would be aqueous hydrogen chloride. The prefix &quot;hydro-&quot; is added only if the acid is made up of just hydrogen and one other element.

==Acid strength==
{{main|Acid strength}}

The strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton. A strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water; in other words, one [[mole (unit)|mole]] of a strong acid HA dissolves in water yielding one mole of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and one mole of the conjugate base, A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, and none of the protonated acid HA. In contrast, a weak acid only partially dissociates and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution. Examples of [[strong acid]]s are [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl), [[hydroiodic acid]] (HI), [[hydrobromic acid]] (HBr), [[perchloric acid]] (HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitric acid]] (HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[sulfuric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). In water each of these essentially ionizes 100%. The stronger an acid is, the more easily it loses a proton, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Two key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the [[chemical polarity|polarity]] of the H—A bond and the size of atom A, which determines the strength of the H—A bond. Acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base.

Stronger acids have a larger ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and a more negative p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; than weaker acids.

Sulfonic acids, which are organic oxyacids, are a class of strong acids. A common example is [[toluenesulfonic acid]] (tosylic acid). Unlike sulfuric acid itself, sulfonic acids can be solids. In fact, [[polystyrene]] functionalized into polystyrene sulfonate is a solid strongly acidic plastic that is filterable.

[[Superacid]]s are acids stronger than 100% sulfuric acid. Examples of superacids are [[fluoroantimonic acid]], [[magic acid]] and [[perchloric acid]]. Superacids can permanently protonate water to give ionic, crystalline [[hydronium]] &quot;salts&quot;. They can also quantitatively stabilize [[carbocation]]s.

While ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; measures the strength of an acid compound, the strength of an aqueous acid solution is measured by pH, which is an indication of the concentration of hydronium in the solution.  The pH of a simple solution of an acid compound in water is determined by the dilution of the compound and the compound's ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Chemical characteristics==

===Monoprotic acids===
Monoprotic acids are those acids that are able to donate one [[proton]] per molecule during the process of [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] (sometimes called ionization) as shown below (symbolized by HA):

:::::HA(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;

Common examples of monoprotic acids in [[mineral acid]]s include [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) and [[nitric acid]] (HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). On the other hand, for [[organic acids]] the term mainly indicates the presence of one [[carboxylic acid]] group and sometimes these acids are known as monocarboxylic acid. Examples in [[organic acids]] include [[formic acid]] (HCOOH), [[acetic acid]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH) and [[benzoic acid]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;COOH).
{{See also|Acid dissociation constant#Monoprotic acids}}

===Polyprotic acids===
Polyprotic acids, also known as polybasic acids, are able to donate more than one proton per acid molecule, in contrast to monoprotic acids that only donate one proton per molecule. Specific types of polyprotic acids have more specific names, such as diprotic acid (two potential protons to donate) and triprotic acid (three potential protons to donate).

A diprotic acid (here symbolized by H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A) can undergo one or two dissociations depending on the pH. Each dissociation has its own dissociation constant, K&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; and K&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt;.

:::::H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + HA&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt;

:::::HA&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + A&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq)&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt;

The first dissociation constant is typically greater than the second; i.e., ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt;. For example, [[sulfuric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) can donate one proton to form the [[bisulfate]] anion (HSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), for which ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; is very large; then it can donate a second proton to form the [[sulfate]] anion (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;), wherein the ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt; is intermediate strength. The large ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; for the first dissociation makes sulfuric a strong acid. In a similar manner, the weak unstable [[carbonic acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) can lose one proton to form [[bicarbonate]] anion (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and lose a second to form [[carbonate]] anion (CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;). Both ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values are small, but ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt; .

A triprotic acid (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A) can undergo one, two, or three dissociations and has three dissociation constants, where ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a3&lt;/sub&gt;.

:::::H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt;

:::::H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + HA&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt;

:::::HA&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + A&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a3&lt;/sub&gt;

An [[inorganic]] example of a triprotic acid is orthophosphoric acid (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), usually just called [[phosphoric acid]]. All three protons can be successively lost to yield H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, then HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;, and finally PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3-&lt;/sup&gt;, the orthophosphate ion, usually just called [[phosphate]]. An [[organic compound|organic]] example of a triprotic acid is [[citric acid]], which can successively lose three protons to finally form the [[citrate]] ion. Even though the positions of the protons on the original molecule may be equivalent, the successive ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values will differ since it is energetically less favorable to lose a proton if the conjugate base is more negatively charged.

Although the subsequent loss of each hydrogen ion is less favorable, all of the conjugate bases are present in solution. The fractional concentration, ''α'' (alpha), for each species can be calculated. For example, a generic diprotic acid will generate 3 species in solution: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A, HA&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, and A&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;. The fractional concentrations can be calculated as below when given either the pH (which can be converted to the [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]) or the concentrations of the acid with all its conjugate bases:

&lt;math&gt;
\alpha_{H_2 A}={{[H^+]^2} \over {[H^+]^2 + [H^+]K_1 + K_1 K_2}}= {{[H_2 A]} \over {[H_2 A]+[HA^-]+[A^{2-} ]}}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\alpha_{HA^- }={{[H^+]K_1} \over {[H^+]^2 + [H^+]K_1 + K_1 K_2}}= {{[HA^-]} \over {[H_2 A]+[HA^-]+[A^{2-} ]}}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\alpha_{A^{2-}}={{K_1 K_2} \over {[H^+]^2 + [H^+]K_1 + K_1 K_2}}= {{[A^{2-} ]} \over {[H_2 A]+[HA^-]+[A^{2-} ]}}
&lt;/math&gt;

A plot of these fractional concentrations against pH, for given ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is known as a [[Bjerrum plot]].

A pattern is observed in the above equations and can be expanded to the general ''n'' -protic acid that has been deprotonated ''i'' -times:

&lt;math&gt;
\alpha_{H_{n-i} A^{i-} }= {{[H^+ ]^{n-i} \displaystyle \prod_{j=0}^{i}K_j} \over { \displaystyle \sum_{i=0}^n \Big[ [H^+ ]^{n-i} \displaystyle \prod_{j=0}^{i}K_j} \Big] }

&lt;/math&gt;
where K&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 and the other K-terms are the dissociation constants for the acid.

===Neutralization===
[[Image:Hydrochloric acid ammonia.jpg|thumb|[[Hydrochloric acid]] (in [[beaker (glassware)|beaker]]) reacting with [[ammonia]] fumes to produce [[ammonium chloride]] (white smoke).]]
[[Neutralization (chemistry)|Neutralization]] is the reaction between an acid and a base, producing a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] and neutralized base; for example, [[hydrochloric acid]] and [[sodium hydroxide]] form [[sodium chloride]] and water:

::HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) + NaCl(aq)

Neutralization is the basis of [[titration]], where a [[pH indicator]] shows equivalence point when the equivalent number of moles of a base have been added to an acid. It is often wrongly assumed that neutralization should result in a solution with pH 7.0, which is only the case with similar acid and base strengths during a reaction.

Neutralization with a base weaker than the acid results in a weakly acidic salt. An example is the weakly acidic [[ammonium chloride]], which is produced from the strong acid [[hydrogen chloride]] and the weak base [[ammonia]]. Conversely, neutralizing a weak acid with a strong base gives a weakly basic salt, e.g. [[sodium fluoride]] from [[hydrogen fluoride]] and [[sodium hydroxide]].

===Weak acid–weak base equilibrium===
{{main|Henderson–Hasselbalch equation}}
In order for a protonated acid to lose a proton, the pH of the system must rise above the p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of the acid. The decreased concentration of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in that basic solution shifts the equilibrium towards the conjugate base form (the deprotonated form of the acid). In lower-pH (more acidic) solutions, there is a high enough H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration in the solution to cause the acid to remain in its protonated form.

Solutions of weak acids and salts of their conjugate bases form [[buffer solution]]s.

==Applications of acids==
There are numerous uses for acids. Acids are often used to remove rust and other corrosion from metals in a process known as [[pickling (metal)|pickling]]. They may be used as an electrolyte in a [[wet cell battery]], such as [[sulfuric acid]] in a [[car battery]].

Strong acids, sulfuric acid in particular, are widely used in mineral processing. For example, phosphate minerals react with sulfuric acid to produce [[phosphoric acid]] for the production of phosphate fertilizers, and [[zinc]] is produced by dissolving zinc oxide into sulfuric acid, purifying the solution and electrowinning.

In the chemical industry, acids react in neutralization reactions to produce salts. For example, [[nitric acid]] reacts with [[ammonia]] to produce [[ammonium nitrate]], a fertilizer. Additionally, [[carboxylic acid]]s can be [[Esterification|esterified]] with [[alcohol]]s, to produce [[ester]]s.

Acids are used as additives to drinks and foods, as they alter their taste and serve as preservatives. [[Phosphoric acid]], for example, is a component of [[cola]] drinks. Acetic acid is used in day to day life as vinegar. Carbonic acid is an important part of some cola drinks and soda.  Citric acid is used as a preservative in sauces and pickles.

[[Tartaric acid]] is an important component of some commonly used foods like unripened mangoes and tamarind. Natural fruits and vegetables also contain acids. [[Citric acid]] is present in oranges, lemon and other citrus fruits. [[Oxalic acid]] is present in tomatoes, spinach, and especially in [[carambola]] and [[rhubarb]]; rhubarb leaves and unripe carambolas are toxic because of high concentrations of oxalic acid.

[[Ascorbic acid]] (Vitamin C) is an essential vitamin for the human body and is present in such foods as amla, lemon, citrus fruits, and guava.

Certain acids are used as drugs. [[Acetylsalicylic acid]] (Aspirin) is used as a pain killer and for bringing down fevers.

Acids play important roles in the human body. The hydrochloric acid present in the stomach aids in digestion by breaking down large and complex food molecules. Amino acids are required for synthesis of proteins required for growth and repair of body tissues. Fatty acids are also required for growth and repair of body tissues. Nucleic acids are important for the manufacturing of DNA and RNA and transmitting of traits to offspring through genes. Carbonic acid is important for maintenance of pH equilibrium in the body.

===Acid catalysis===
{{Main|Acid catalysis}}
Acids are used as [[catalyst]]s in industrial and organic chemistry; for example, [[sulfuric acid]] is used in very large quantities in the [[alkylation]] process to produce gasoline. Strong acids, such as sulfuric, phosphoric and hydrochloric acids also effect [[Dehydration reaction|dehydration]] and [[condensation reaction]]s. In biochemistry, many [[enzyme]]s employ acid catalysis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Voet acid cat&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Voet, Judith G.; Voet, Donald |title=Biochemistry |publisher=J. Wiley &amp; Sons |location=New York |year=2004 |pages=496–500 |isbn=978-0-471-19350-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological occurrence==
[[Image:Aminoacid.png|thumb|left|Basic structure of an [[amino acid]].]]Many biologically important molecules are acids. [[Nucleic acid]]s, which contain acidic [[phosphate|phosphate groups]], include [[DNA]] and [[RNA]]. Nucleic acids contain the genetic code that determines many of an organism's characteristics, and is passed from parents to offspring. DNA contains the chemical blueprint for the synthesis of [[protein]]s which are made up of [[amino acid]] subunits. [[Cell membrane]]s contain [[fatty acid]] [[ester]]s such as [[phospholipids]].

An α-amino acid has a central carbon (the α or [[alpha and beta carbon|''alpha'' carbon]]) which is covalently bonded to a [[carboxyl]] group (thus they are [[carboxylic acid]]s), an [[amine|amino]] group, a hydrogen atom and a variable group. The variable group, also called the R group or side chain, determines the identity and many of the properties of a specific amino acid. In [[glycine]], the simplest amino acid, the R group is a hydrogen atom, but in all other amino acids it is contains one or more carbon atoms bonded to hydrogens, and may contain other elements such as sulfur, oxygen or nitrogen. With the exception of glycine, naturally occurring amino acids are [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] and almost invariably occur in the [[Chirality (chemistry)#By configuration: D- and L-|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-configuration]]. [[Peptidoglycan]], found in some [[bacteria]]l [[cell wall]]s contains some &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids. At physiological pH, typically around 7, free amino acids exist in a charged form, where the acidic carboxyl group (-COOH) loses a proton (-COO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and the basic amine group (-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gains a proton (-NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). The entire molecule has a net neutral charge and is a [[zwitterion]], with the exception of amino acids with basic or acidic side chains. [[Aspartic acid]], for example, possesses one protonated amine and two deprotonated carboxyl groups, for a net charge of −1 at physiological pH.

Fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives are another group of carboxylic acids that play a significant role in biology. These contain long hydrocarbon chains and a carboxylic acid group on one end. The cell membrane of nearly all organisms is primarily made up of a [[phospholipid bilayer]], a [[micelle]] of hydrophobic fatty acid esters with polar, hydrophilic [[phosphate]] &quot;head&quot; groups. Membranes contain additional components, some of which can participate in acid-base reactions.

In humans and many other animals, [[hydrochloric acid]] is a part of the [[gastric acid]] secreted within the [[stomach]] to help hydrolyze [[protein]]s and [[polysaccharide]]s, as well as converting the inactive pro-enzyme, [[pepsinogen]] into the [[digestive enzyme|enzyme]], [[pepsin]]. Some organisms produce acids for defense; for example, ants produce [[formic acid]].

Acid-base equilibrium plays a critical role in regulating [[mammal]]ian breathing. [[molecular oxygen|Oxygen]] gas (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) drives [[cellular respiration]], the process by which animals release the chemical [[potential energy]] stored in food, producing [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as a byproduct. Oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged in the [[lungs]], and the body responds to changing energy demands by adjusting the rate of [[ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]]. For example, during periods of exertion the body rapidly breaks down stored [[carbohydrate]]s and [[fat]], releasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the blood stream. In aqueous solutions such as blood CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exists in equilibrium with [[carbonic acid]] and [[bicarbonate]] ion.
: CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
It is the decrease in pH that signals the brain to breathe faster and deeper, expelling the excess CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and resupplying the cells with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Image:Aspirin-skeletal.svg|thumb|right|[[Aspirin]] (acetylsalicylic acid) is a [[carboxylic acid]].]] [[Cell membrane]]s are generally impermeable to charged or large, polar molecules because of the [[lipophilicity|lipophilic]] fatty acyl chains comprising their interior. Many biologically important molecules, including a number of pharmaceutical agents, are organic weak acids which can cross the membrane in their protonated, uncharged form but not in their charged form (i.e. as the conjugate base). For this reason the activity of many drugs can be enhanced or inhibited by the use of antacids or acidic foods. The charged form, however, is often more soluble in blood and [[cytosol]], both aqueous environments. When the extracellular environment is more acidic than the neutral pH within the cell, certain acids will exist in their neutral form and will be membrane soluble, allowing them to cross the phospholipid bilayer. Acids that lose a proton at the [[intracellular pH]] will exist in their soluble, charged form and are thus able to diffuse through the cytosol to their target. [[Ibuprofen]], [[aspirin]] and [[penicillin]] are examples of drugs that are weak acids.

==Common acids==

===Mineral acids (inorganic acids)===
* Hydrogen halides and their solutions: [[hydrofluoric acid]] (HF), [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl), [[hydrobromic acid]] (HBr), [[hydroiodic acid]] (HI)
* Halogen oxoacids: [[hypochlorous acid]] (HClO), [[chlorous acid]] (HClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[chloric acid]] (HClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[perchloric acid]] (HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and corresponding compounds for bromine and iodine

The primary use (70%) of asphalt/bitumen is in road construction, where it is used as the glue or binder mixed with [[construction aggregate|aggregate]] particles to create [[asphalt concrete]]. Its other main uses are for [[bituminous waterproofing]] products, including production of [[roofing felt]] and for sealing flat roofs.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Anja Sörensen and Bodo Wichert &quot;Asphalt and Bitumen&quot; in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2009. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a03_169.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms ''asphalt'' and ''bitumen'' are often used interchangeably to mean both natural and manufactured forms of the substance. In [[American English]], asphalt (or asphalt cement) is the carefully refined residue from the [[distillation]] process of selected crude oils. Outside the United States, the product is often called bitumen. Geological terminology often prefers the term ''bitumen''. Common usage often refers to various forms of asphalt/bitumen as &quot;tar&quot;, such as at the [[La Brea Tar Pits]]. Another term, mostly archaic, refers to asphalt/bitumen as &quot;pitch&quot;. The pitch used in this mixture is sometimes found in natural deposits but usually made by the distillation of crude oil.

Naturally occurring asphalt/bitumen is sometimes specified by the term &quot;crude bitumen&quot;. Its viscosity is similar to that of cold [[molasses]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Composition==
{{see also|Asphaltene}}
The components of asphalt are classified into four classes of compounds: 
*saturates, [[saturated hydrocarbons]], the %saturates correlates with softening point of the material
*Naphthene aromatics, consisting of partially hydrogenated [[polycyclic aromatic compound]]s.
*Polar aromatics, consisting of high [[molecular weight]] [[phenol]]s and [[carboxylic acid]]s
*Asphaltenes, consisting of high [[molecular weight]] [[phenol]]s and [[heterocyclic compound]]s
The naphthene aromatics and polar aromatics are typically the majority components.   Additionally, most natural bitumens contain [[organosulfur compound]]s, resulting in an overall sulfur content of up to 4%.  Nickel and [[vanadium]] are found in the &lt;10 ppm level, as is typical of some petroleum.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

The substance is soluble in [[carbon disulfide]]. It is commonly modelled as a [[colloid]], with [[asphaltene]]s as the dispersed phase and [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/maltene maltenes] as the continuous phase.&lt;ref name=&quot;Quddus&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Muhammad Abdul Quddus|year=1992 | title=thesis submitted to Department of Applied Chemistry; University of Karachi |chapter=Catalytic Oxidation of Asphalt| publisher=Higher Education Commission Pakistan: Pakistan Research Repository| location=Pakistan |page=6, in ch.2 pdf |url=http://eprints.hec.gov.pk/1171/1/891.html.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;it is almost impossible to separate and identify all the different molecules of asphalt, because the number of molecules with different chemical structure is extremely large&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Quddus99&quot;&gt;Muhammad Abdul Quddus (1992), p.99, in ch.5 pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Asphalt/bitumen can sometimes be confused with &quot;[[coal tar|tar]]&quot;, which is a similar black, thermoplastic material produced by the [[destructive distillation]] of coal. During the early and mid-20th century when [[town gas]] was produced, tar was a readily available product and extensively used as the binder for road aggregates. The addition of tar to [[macadam]] roads led to the word [[tarmac]], which is now used in common parlance to refer to road-making materials. However, since the 1970s, when natural gas succeeded town gas, asphalt/bitumen has completely overtaken the use of tar in these applications. Other examples of this confusion include the [[La Brea Tar Pits]] and the Canadian [[tar sands]]. Pitch is another term mistakenly used at times to refer to asphalt/bitumen, as in [[Pitch Lake]].

==Occurrence==
[[File:Puy de Poix, gisement bitumeux.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Bituminous outcrop of the Puy de la Poix, [[Clermont-Ferrand]], France]]

The great majority of asphalt used commercially is obtained from petroleum. Nonetheless, large amounts of asphalt occur in concentrated form in nature. Naturally occurring deposits of asphalt/bitumen are formed from the remains of ancient, microscopic [[algae]] ([[diatom]]s) and other once-living things. These remains were deposited in the mud on the bottom of the ocean or lake where the organisms lived. Under the heat (above 50&amp;nbsp;°C) and [[pressure]] of burial deep in the earth, the remains were transformed into materials such as asphalt/bitumen, [[kerogen]], or petroleum. Deposits at the [[La Brea Tar Pits]] are an example.

Natural deposits of asphalt/bitumen include lakes such as the [[Pitch Lake]] in Trinidad and Tobago and [[Lake Bermudez]] in Venezuela. Natural seeps of asphalt/bitumen occur in the La Brea Tar Pits and in the [[Dead Sea]].

Asphalt/bitumen also occurs as impregnated sandstones known as bituminous rock and the similar &quot;tar sands&quot; such as in Athabasca, Canada and Utah, USA. The [[Athabasca oil sands|Athabasca tar sands]] are located in the [[McMurray Formation]], Alberta. This Formation is of early [[Cretaceous]] age, and is composed of numerous [[lens_(geology)|lenses]] of oil-bearing sand with up to 20% oil.&lt;ref name=bunger&gt;J. Bunger, K. Thomas and S. Dorrence. 1979. Compound types and properties of Utah and Athabasca tar sand bitumens. Fuel 58(3), 183–195.&lt;/ref&gt; Isotopic studies attribute the oil deposits to be about 110 Ma old.&lt;ref&gt;D. Selby and R. Creaser. 2005. Direct radiometric dating of hydrocarbon deposits using rhenium-osmium isotopes. Science 308, 1293–1295.&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy oil or bitumen deposits also occur in the [[Uinta Basin]] in Utah, USA. The Tar Sand Triangle deposit, for example, is roughly 6% bitumen.&lt;ref name=bunger /&gt;

Asphalt/bitumen occurs in [[hydrothermal vein]]s. An example of this is within the Uinta Basin of Utah, USA, where there is a swarm of laterally and vertically extensive veins composed of a solid hydrocarbon termed [[Gilsonite]]. These veins formed by the polymerisation and solidification of hydrocarbons that were mobilized from the deeper oil shales of the [[Green River Formation]] during burial and diagenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=T. Boden and B. Tripp |title=Gilsonite Veins of the Uinta Basin, Utah |publisher=Utah Geological Survey, Special Study 141 |location=Utah, USA |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asphalt/bitumen is similar to the organic matter in carbonaceous meteorites.&lt;ref&gt;Hayatsu et al., Meteoritics, Vol. 18, p.310&lt;/ref&gt; However, detailed studies have shown these materials to be distinct.&lt;ref&gt;Kim &amp; Yang, Journal of Astronomy and Space Sciences, vol. 15, no. 1, p.163-174&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ancient times===
The use of asphalt/bitumen for waterproofing and as an adhesive dates at least to the fifth [[millennium]] B.C. in the early [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus community]] of [[Mehrgarh]], where it was used to line the baskets in which they gathered crops.&lt;ref&gt;McIntosh, Jane. The Ancient Indus Valley. p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ancient Middle East, the [[Sumer]]ians used natural asphalt/bitumen deposits for [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] between bricks and stones, to cement parts of carvings, such as eyes, into place, for ship [[caulking]], and for waterproofing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abraham1938&quot; /&gt; The Greek historian [[Herodotus]] said hot asphalt/bitumen was used as mortar in the walls of [[Babylon]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, Book I, 179&lt;/ref&gt;

In some versions of the [[Book of Genesis]] in the Bible, the name of the substance used to bind the bricks of the [[Tower of Babel]] is translated as bitumen (see Gen 11:3), while other translations use the word ''pitch''. A one-kilometre tunnel beneath the river [[Euphrates]] at [[Babylon]] in the time of Queen [[Semiramis]] (ca. 800 B.C.) was reportedly constructed of burnt bricks covered with asphalt/bitumen as a waterproofing agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/asphaltsandallie031010mbp/asphaltsandallie031010mbp_djvu.txt|title=Asphalts And Allied Substances|year=1920|author=Abraham, Herbert|publisher=D. Van Nostrand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asphalt/bitumen was used by [[ancient Egypt]]ians to [[embalm]] mummies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abraham1938&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pringle, Heather Anne |title=The Mummy Congress: Science, Obsession, and the Everlasting Dead |publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Books |location=New York, NY |year=2001 |pages= 196–197|isbn=0-7607-7151-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Persian language|Persian]] word for asphalt is ''moom'', which is related to the English word [[mummy]]. The Egyptians' primary source of asphalt/bitumen was the [[Dead Sea]], which the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] knew as ''Palus Asphaltites'' (Asphalt Lake).

Approximately 40 AD, [[Dioscorides]] described the Dead Sea material as ''Judaicum bitumen'', and noted other places in the region where it could be found: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The Judaicum Bitumen is better than others; that is reckoned the best, which doth shine like purple, being of a strong scent &amp; weightie, but the black and fowle is naught for it is adulterated with Pitch mixed with it. It growes in [[Phoenice]] also, and in [[Sidon]], &amp; in [[Babylon]], &amp; in [[Zakynthos|Zacynthum]]. It is found also moyst swimming upon wells in the country of the [[Agrigento|Agrigentines]] of [[Sicily|Sicilie]], which they use for lamps instead of oyle, and which they call falsely Sicilian oyle, for it is a kinde of moyst Bitumen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=De Materia Medica|author=Pedanius Dioscorides|year=ca. 40 A.D.}} translated by Goodyer (1655) [http://www.therenaissanceman.org/images/DIOSCORIDES-Intro_Book_1.doc] ''or'' ''(Greek/Latin)'' compiled by Sprengel (1829) [http://books.google.com/books/download/Pedanii_Dioscoridis_____de_materia_medic.pdf?id=JwAUAAAAQAAJ&amp;output=pdf] p. 100 (p. 145 in PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Sidon bitumen is thought to refer to asphalt/bitumen found at [[Hasbeya]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ConnanNissenbaum2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Connan|first1=Jacques|last2=Nissenbaum|first2=Arie|title=The organic geochemistry of the Hasbeya asphalt (Lebanon): comparison with asphalts from the Dead Sea area and Iraq|journal=Organic Geochemistry|volume=35|issue=6|year=2004|pages=775–789|issn=01466380|doi=10.1016/j.orggeochem.2004.01.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny refers also to asphalt/bitumen being found in [[Selenicë|Epirus]]. It was a valuable strategic resource; the object of the first known battle for a hydrocarbon deposit, between the [[Seleucid]]s and the [[Nabateans]] in 312 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://payperview.datapages.com/data/open/offer.do?target=%2Fbulletns%2F1977-79%2Fdata%2Fpg%2F0062%2F0005%2F0800%2F0837.htm|title=Dead Sea Asphalts—Historical Aspects [free abstract]|author=Arie Nissenbaum|journal=AAPG Bulletin|volume=62|issue=5|date=May 1978|pages=837–844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ancient Far East, natural asphalt/bitumen was slowly boiled to get rid of the higher fractions, leaving a material of higher molecular weight which is thermoplastic and when layered on objects, became quite hard upon cooling. This was used to cover objects that needed waterproofing,&lt;ref name=&quot;Abraham1938&quot; /&gt; such as [[scabbard]]s and other items. Statuettes of household [[deities]] were also cast with this type of material in Japan, and probably also in China.

In North America, archaeological recovery has indicated asphalt/bitumen was sometimes used to adhere stone [[projectile point]]s to wooden shafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Megalithic Portal and Megalith Map |url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18502 |title=C.Michael Hogan (2008) '&amp;#39;Morro Creek'&amp;#39;, ed. by A. Burnham |publisher=Megalithic.co.uk |accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early use in Europe===
100 years after the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, [[Pierre Belon]] described in his work ''[[Observations (Pierre Belon)|Observations]]'' in 1553 that ''pissasphalto'' a mixture of [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] and bitumen was used in [[Dubrovnik]] for tarring of ships from where it was exported to a market place in [[Venice]] where it could be bought by anyone.&lt;ref&gt;Africa and the Discovery of America, Volume 1, page 183, [[Leo Wiener]], BoD – Books on Demand, 1920 reprinted in 2012, ISBN 9783864034329&lt;/ref&gt;
An 1838 edition of ''Mechanics Magazine'' cites an early use of asphalt in France. A pamphlet dated 1621, by &quot;a certain Monsieur d'Eyrinys, states that he had discovered the existence (of asphaltum) in large quantities in the vicinity of Neufchatel&quot;, and that he proposed to use it in a variety of ways – &quot;principally in the construction of air-proof granaries, and in protecting, by means of the arches, the water-courses in the city of Paris from the intrusion of dirt and filth&quot;, which at that time made the water unusable. &quot;He expatiates also on the excellence of this material for forming level and durable terraces&quot; in palaces, &quot;the notion of forming such terraces in the streets not one likely to cross the brain of a Parisian of that generation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MechanicsMagazineSep1838176&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=|last=|year=1838| month= 7–29 April September | title=The Mechanic's magazine, museum, register, journal and gazette| volume=29|chapter=Nothing New under the Sun (on French asphaltum use in 1621)| publisher=W.A.

Then, in the 1830s, there was a surge of interest, and asphalt became widely used &quot;for pavements, flat roofs, and the lining of cisterns, and in England, some use of it had been made of it for similar purposes&quot;. Its rise in Europe was &quot;a sudden phenomenon&quot;, after natural deposits were found &quot;in France at Osbann ([[Bas-Rhin|BasRhin]]), the Parc (l'Ain) and the Puy-de-la-Poix ([[Puy-de-Dôme|Puy-de-Dome]])&quot;, although it could also be made artificially.&lt;ref name=&quot;LewisMiles&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Miles, Lewis |title=in Australian Building: A Cultural Investigation |volume=|chapter=Section 10.6: Damp Proofing|year=2000 | publisher= | location=|page=10.06.1| url=http://www.mileslewis.net/australian-building/pdf/climatic-design/climatic-design-damp-proofing.pdf|accessdate=11 November 2009}}. Note: different sections of Miles' online work were written in different years, as evidenced at the top of each page (not including the heading page of each section). This particular section appears to have been written in 2000&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest uses in France was the laying of about 24,000 square yards of Seyssel asphalt at the [[Place de la Concorde]] in 1835.&lt;ref name=Forbes1858&gt;{{citation |year=1958 |author=R.J.

===Photography and art===
Asphalt/bitumen was used in early photographic technology. In 1826 or 1827, it was used by French scientist [[Joseph Nicéphore Niépce]] to make the [[View from the Window at Le Gras|oldest surviving photograph from nature]]. The asphalt/bitumen was thinly coated onto a [[pewter]] plate which was then exposed in a camera. Exposure to light hardened the asphalt/bitumen and made it insoluble, so that when it was subsequently rinsed with a solvent only the sufficiently light-struck areas remained. Many hours of exposure in the camera were required, making asphalt/bitumen impractical for ordinary photography, but from the 1850s to the 1920s it was in common use as a [[photoresist]] in the production of printing plates for various photomechanical printing processes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niepce.org/pagus/pagus-inv.html Niépce Museum history pages.] Retrieved 27 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/permanent/wfp/ The First Photograph (Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas at Austin).] Retrieved 27 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Asphalt/bitumen was the nemesis of many artists during the 19th century. Although widely used for a time, it ultimately proved unstable for use in oil painting, especially when mixed with the most common dilutents, such as linseed oil, varnish and turpentine. Unless thoroughly diluted, asphalt/bitumen never fully solidifies and will in time corrupt the other pigments with which it comes into contact. The use of asphalt/bitumen as a glaze to set in shadow or mixed with other colours to render a darker tone resulted in the eventual deterioration of a good many paintings, those of [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]] being just one notable example. Perhaps the most famous example of the destructiveness of asphalt/bitumen is [[Théodore Géricault]]'s [[Raft of the Medusa]] (1818–1819), where his use of asphalt/bitumen caused the brilliant colors to degenerate into dark greens and blacks and the paint and canvas to buckle.

===Early use in the United Kingdom===
Among the earlier uses of asphalt/bitumen in the United Kingdom was for etching. William Salmon's ''Polygraphice'' (1673) provides a recipe for varnish used in etching, consisting of three ounces of virgin wax, two ounces of [[mastic (plant resin)|mastic]], and one ounce of asphaltum.&lt;ref name=&quot;SalmonPolygraphice&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=William|last=Salmon|year=1673|publisher=R.

The first British patent for the use of asphalt/bitumen was Cassell's patent asphalte or bitumen' in 1834.&lt;ref name=&quot;LewisMiles&quot; /&gt; Then on 25 November 1837, [[Captain R. T.

Indeed in 1838, there was a flurry of entrepreneurial activity over asphalt/bitumen, which had uses beyond paving. For example, asphalt could also used for flooring, damp proofing in buildings, and for waterproofing of various types of pools and baths, with these latter themselves proliferating in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abraham1938&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LewisMiles&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerhard1908&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=W.M.

=== Early use in the United States ===
The first use of asphalt/bitumen in the New World was by indigenous peoples. On the west coast, as early as the 13th century, the [[Tongva people|Tongva]], [[Luiseño people|Luiseño]] and [[Chumash people|Chumash]] peoples collected the naturally occurring asphalt/bitumen that seeped to the surface above underlying petroleum deposits. All three used the substance as an adhesive. It is found on many different artifacts of tools and ceremonial items. For example, it was used on [[rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]]s to adhere gourds or turtle shells to rattle handles. It was also used in decorations. Small round shell beads were often set in asphaltum to provide decorations. It was used as a sealant on baskets to make them watertight for carrying water. Asphaltum was used also to seal the planks on ocean-going canoes.

Roads in the US have been paved with materials that include asphalt/bitumen since at least 1870, when a street in front of the Newark, NJ City Hall was paved. In many cases, these early pavings were made from naturally occurring &quot;bituminous rock&quot;, such as at Ritchie Mines in Macfarlan in [[Ritchie County, West Virginia]] from 1852 to 1873. In 1876, asphalt-based paving was used to pave Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, DC, in time for the celebration of the national centennial.&lt;ref name=&quot;NAPA2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Dan |last=McNichol|year=2005| title=Paving the Way: Asphalt in America| edition=|editor= |chapter=| publisher=National Asphalt Pavement Association| location=Lanham, MD |pages= |url=http://store.hotmix.org/index.php?productID=144|isbn=0-914313-04-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asphalt/bitumen was also used for flooring, paving and waterproofing of baths and swimming pools during the early 20th century, following similar trends in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerhard1908&quot; /&gt;

==Modern use==

[[File:Road repaving.jpg|thumb|The road surface is removed and a new bitumen layer is added]]

=== Rolled asphalt concrete ===
{{main|Asphalt concrete}}
The largest use of asphalt/bitumen is for making [[asphalt concrete]] for road surfaces and accounts for approximately 85% of the asphalt consumed in the United States. Asphalt concrete pavement material is commonly composed of 5% asphalt/bitumen cement and 95% aggregates (stone, sand, and gravel). Due to its highly viscous nature, asphalt/bitumen cement must be heated so it can be mixed with the aggregates at the asphalt mixing plant. There are about 4,000 asphalt concrete mixing plants in the U.S., and a similar number in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Asphalt Paving Industry: A Global Perspective, 2nd Edition | publisher = National Asphalt Pavement Association and European Asphalt Pavement Association | date = February 2011 | year = 2011 | location = Lanham, Maryland, and Brussels | url = http://www.asphaltpavement.org/images/stories/GL_101_Edition_3.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 27 September 2012 | isbn = 0-914313-06-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asphalt concrete road surface is the most widely recycled material in the U.S., both by gross tonnage and by percentage. According to an industry survey conducted by the [[Federal Highway Administration]] and the National Asphalt Pavement Association and released in 2011, more than 99% of the asphalt removed each year from road surfaces during widening and resurfacing projects is reused as part of new pavements, roadbeds, shoulders and embankments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New FHWA Survey Finds Asphalt Recycling Reaches 99 Percent|url=http://www.asphaltpavement.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=25&amp;Itemid=45|work=Asphalt Pavement Mix Production Survey: 2009–2010|publisher=National Asphalt Pavement Association|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Asphalt shingle|Roofing shingle]]s account for most of the remaining asphalt/bitumen consumption. Other uses include cattle sprays, fence-post treatments, and waterproofing for fabrics.

Asphalt concrete paving is widely used in airports around the world. Due to the sturdiness and ability to be repaired quickly, it is widely used for runways dedicated to aircraft landing and taking off.

=== Mastic asphalt ===
[[Mastic asphalt]] is a type of asphalt which differs from dense graded asphalt ([[asphalt concrete]]) in that it has a higher asphalt/bitumen ([[binder (material)|binder]]) content, usually around 7–10% of the whole aggregate mix, as opposed to rolled asphalt concrete, which has only around 5% added asphalt/bitumen. This thermoplastic substance is widely used in the building industry for waterproofing flat roofs and tanking underground. Mastic asphalt is heated to a temperature of {{convert|210|°C|°F}} and is spread in layers to form an impervious barrier about {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=off|sp=us}} thick.

=== Asphalt emulsion ===
A number of technologies allow asphalt/bitumen to be mixed at much lower temperatures. These involve mixing with petroleum solvents to form &quot;cutbacks&quot; with reduced melting point, or mixtures with water to turn the asphalt/bitumen into an [[emulsion]]. Asphalt emulsions contain up to 70% asphalt/bitumen and typically less than 1.5% chemical additives. There are two main types of emulsions with different affinity for aggregates, [[cationic]] and [[anionic]]. Asphalt emulsions are used in a wide variety of applications. [[Chipseal]] involves spraying the road surface with asphalt emulsion followed by a layer of crushed rock, gravel or crushed slag. Slurry seal involves the creation of a mixture of asphalt emulsion and fine crushed aggregate that is spread on the surface of a road. Cold-mixed asphalt can also be made from asphalt emulsion to create pavements similar to hot-mixed asphalt, several inches in depth and asphalt emulsions are also blended into recycled hot-mix asphalt to create low-cost pavements.

===Other uses===
Asphalt/bitumen is used to make [[Japan black]], a [[lacquer]] known especially for its use on iron and steel. Asphalt/bitumen also is used in paint and marker inks by some graffiti supply companies (primarily Molotow) to increase the weather resistance and permanence of the paint and/or ink, and to make the color much darker.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Asphalt/bitumen is also used to seal some alkaline batteries during the manufacturing process.

==Production==
About 40,000,000 tons were produced in 1984. It is obtained as the &quot;heavy&quot; (i.e., difficult to distill) fraction. Material with a [[boiling point]] greater than around 500&amp;nbsp;°C is considered asphalt. Vacuum distillation separates it from the other components in crude oil (such as [[naphtha]], gasoline and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]]). The resulting material is typically further treated to extract small but valuable amounts of lubricants and to adjust the properties of the material to suit applications. In a [[de-asphalting unit]], the crude asphalt is treated with either [[propane]] or [[butane]] in a [[Supercritical fluid|supercritical]] phase to extract the lighter molecules, which are then separated. Further processing is possible by &quot;blowing&quot; the product: namely reacting it with [[oxygen]]. This step makes the product harder and more viscous.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

Asphalt/bitumen is typically stored and transported at temperatures around {{convert|150|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. Sometimes [[diesel oil]] or [[kerosene]] are mixed in before shipping to retain liquidity; upon delivery, these lighter materials are separated out of the mixture. This mixture is often called &quot;bitumen feedstock&quot;, or BFS. Some [[dump truck]]s route the hot engine exhaust through pipes in the dump body to keep the material warm. The backs of tippers carrying asphalt/bitumen, as well as some handling equipment, are also commonly sprayed with a releasing agent before filling to aid release. Diesel oil is no longer used as a [[release agent]] due to environmental concerns.

===From oil sands===
Naturally occurring crude asphalt/bitumen impregnated in sedimentary rock is the prime feed stock for petroleum production from &quot;[[Oil sands]]&quot;, currently under development in Alberta, Canada. Canada has most of the world's supply of natural asphalt/bitumen, covering 140,000 square kilometres&lt;ref name=oilsands/&gt; (an area larger than England), giving it the second-largest proven [[oil reserves]] in the world. The [[Athabasca oil sands]] is the largest asphalt/bitumen deposit in Canada and the only one accessible to [[surface mining]], although recent technological breakthroughs have resulted in deeper deposits becoming producible by ''[[in-situ#Petroleum|in situ]]'' methods. Because of [[oil price increases since 2003]], upgrading bitumen to synthetic [[crude oil]] has become highly profitable. As of 2006, Canadian crude asphalt/bitumen production averaged about {{convert|1.1|Moilbbl|m3}} per day and was projected to rise to {{convert|4.4|Moilbbl|m3}} per day by 2020.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAPP&quot;/&gt; The total amount of crude asphalt/bitumen in Alberta which could be extracted is estimated to be about {{convert|310|Goilbbl|e9m3|sigfig=1}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Alternatives and bioasphalt ===
{{Main|Peak oil|Global warming|Bioasphalt}}
Although uncompetitive economically, asphalt/bitumen can be made from nonpetroleum-based renewable resources such as sugar, [[molasses]] and rice, corn and potato [[starch]]es. Asphalt/bitumen can also be made from waste material by [[fractional distillation]] of used motor oils, which is sometimes disposed by burning or dumping into landfills; use of these results in premature cracking in colder climates, resulting in roads that need to be repaved more frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Lighter-colored roads absorb less heat from solar radiation, and have less surface heat than darker surfaces, reducing their contribution to the [[urban heat island]] effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/heatisland/ Heat Island Effect].

The word ''asphalt'' is derived from the late Middle English, in turn from French ''asphalte'', based on [[Late Latin]] ''asphalton'', ''asphaltum'', which is the [[Latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἄσφαλτος (''ásphaltos'', ''ásphalton''), a word meaning &quot;asphalt/bitumen/[[Pitch (resin)|pitch]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29%2Fsfaltos ἄσφαλτος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; which perhaps derives from α- &quot;without&quot; and σφάλλω, (''sfallō''), &quot;make fall&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsfa%2Fllw σφάλλω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; Note that in French, the term ''asphalte'' is used for naturally occurring bitumen-soaked limestone deposits, and for specialised manufactured products with fewer voids or greater bitumen content than the &quot;asphaltic concrete&quot; used to pave roads. It is a significant fact that the first use of asphalt by the ancients was in the nature of a cement for securing or joining together various objects, and it thus seems likely that the name itself was expressive of this application. Specifically [[Herodotus]] mentioned that bitumen was brought to Babylon to build its gigantic fortification wall.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''The Histories'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+1.179.4&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 1.179.4], on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; From the Greek, the word passed into late Latin, and thence into French (''asphalte'') and English (&quot;asphaltum&quot; and &quot;asphalt&quot;).

The expression &quot;bitumen&quot; originated in the Sanskrit, where we find the words ''jatu'', meaning &quot;pitch,&quot; and ''jatu-krit'', meaning &quot;pitch creating&quot;, &quot;pitch producing&quot; (referring to coniferous or resinous trees). The Latin equivalent is claimed by some to be originally ''gwitu-men'' (pertaining to pitch), and by others, ''pixtumens'' (exuding or bubbling pitch), which was subsequently shortened to ''bitumen'', thence passing via French into English. From the same root is derived the Anglo Saxon word ''cwidu'' (mastix), the German word ''Kitt'' (cement or mastic) and the old Norse word ''kvada''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abraham19381&quot;&gt;Abraham, Herbert (1938), p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither of the terms asphalt or bitumen should be confused with [[tar]] or [[coal tars]].

=== Modern usage ===
In [[British English]], the word 'asphalt' is used to refer to a mixture of mineral aggregate and asphalt/bitumen (also called [[tarmac]] in common parlance). The earlier word 'asphaltum' is now archaic and not commonly used. In [[American English]], 'asphalt' is equivalent to the British 'bitumen'. However, 'asphalt' is also commonly used as a shortened form of '[[asphalt concrete]]' (therefore equivalent to the British 'asphalt' or 'tarmac'). In [[Australian English]], bitumen is often used as the generic term for road surfaces. In [[Canadian English]], the word bitumen is used to refer to the vast Canadian deposits of extremely heavy [[crude oil]],&lt;ref name=oilsands&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; while asphalt is used for the [[oil refinery]] product used to pave roads and manufacture [[roof shingle]]s and various waterproofing products. Diluted bitumen (diluted with [[naphtha]] to make it flow in pipelines) is known as [[dilbit]] in the Canadian petroleum industry, while bitumen &quot;[[Upgrader|upgraded]]&quot; to [[synthetic crude]] oil is known as syncrude and syncrude blended with bitumen as synbit.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAPP&quot;&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
Bitumen is still the preferred geological term for naturally occurring deposits of the solid or semi-solid form of petroleum. Bituminous rock is a form of sandstone impregnated with bitumen. The [[tar sands]] of [[Alberta, Canada]] are a similar material.

The '''American National Standards Institute''' ('''ANSI''', {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|n|s|iː}} {{respell|AN|see}}) is a private [[non-profit organization]] that oversees the development of [[Standardization|voluntary consensus standards]] for products, services, processes, systems, and personnel in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;RFC 4949&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also coordinates [[United States|U.S.]] standards with international standards so that American products can be used worldwide.  For example, standards ensure that people who own cameras can find the film they need for that camera anywhere around the globe.

ANSI accredits standards that are developed by representatives of other [[standards organization]]s, [[government agency|government agencies]], [[consumer organization|consumer groups]], companies, and others. These standards ensure that the characteristics and performance of products are consistent, that people use the same definitions and terms, and that products are tested the same way. ANSI also accredits organizations that carry out product or personnel certification in accordance with requirements defined in international standards.&lt;ref&gt;ANSI 2009 Annual Report&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization's headquarters are in [[Washington, DC]]. ANSI's operations office is located in [[New York City]]. The ANSI annual operating budget is funded by the sale of publications, membership dues and fees, accreditation services, fee-based programs, and international standards programs.

== History ==
ANSI was originally formed in 1918, when five engineering societies and three government agencies founded the '''American Engineering Standards Committee''' ('''AESC'''). In 1928, the AESC became the '''American Standards Association''' ('''ASA'''). In 1966, the ASA was reorganized and became the '''United States of America Standards Institute''' ('''USASI'''). The present name was adopted in 1969.

Prior to 1918, these five founding engineering societies:
*[[American Institute of Electrical Engineers]] (AIEE, now [[IEEE]])
*[[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] (ASME)
*[[American Society of Civil Engineers]] (ASCE)
*American Institute of Mining Engineers (AIME, now [[American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers]])
*American Society for Testing and Materials (now [[ASTM International]])
had been members of the United Engineering Society (UES).
At the behest of the AIEE, they invited the U.S. government Departments of War, Navy (combined in 1947 to become the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] or DOD) and Commerce&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansi.org/about_ansi/introduction/history.aspx?menuid=1 ANSI history]- Retrieved 2011-09-27&lt;/ref&gt; to join in founding a national standards organization.

According to Paul G. Agnew, the first permanent secretary and head of staff in 1919, AESC started as an ambitious program and little else.  Staff for the first year consisted of one executive, Clifford B. LePage, who was on loan from a founding member, ASME.  An annual budget of $7,500 was provided by the founding bodies.

In 1931, the organization (renamed ASA in 1928) became affiliated with the U.S. National Committee of the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] ([[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]]), which had been formed in 1904 to develop electrical and electronics standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iec.ch/ Welcome to IEC - International Electrotechnical Commission&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
ANSI's membership comprises government agencies, organizations, corporations, academic and international bodies, and individuals. In total, the Institute represents the interests of more than 125,000 companies and 3.5 million professionals.&lt;ref name=&quot;membership&quot;&gt;ANSI membership page, [http://www.ansi.org/membership/overview/overview.aspx?menuid=2www.ansi.org/membership www.ansi.org/membership]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
Though ANSI itself does not develop standards, the Institute oversees the development and use of standards by accrediting the procedures of standards developing organizations. ANSI accreditation signifies that the procedures used by standards developing organizations meet the Institute's requirements for openness, balance, consensus, and due process.

ANSI also designates specific standards as American National Standards, or ANS, when the Institute determines that the standards were developed in an environment that is equitable, accessible and responsive to the requirements of various stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publicaa.ansi.org/sites/apdl/Documents/News%20and%20Publications/Brochures/Value%20of%20the%20ANS.pdf ''Value of the ANS Designation'' brochure]&lt;/ref&gt;

Voluntary consensus standards quicken the market acceptance of products while making clear how to improve the safety of those products for the protection of consumers. There are approximately 9,500 American National Standards that carry the ANSI designation.

The American National Standards process involves:
*consensus by a group that is open to representatives from all interested parties
*broad-based public review and comment on draft standards
*consideration of and response to comments
*incorporation of submitted changes that meet the same consensus requirements into a draft standard
*availability of an appeal by any participant alleging that these principles were not respected during the standards-development process.

==International activities==
In addition to facilitating the formation of standards in the U.S., ANSI promotes the use of U.S. standards internationally, advocates U.S. policy and technical positions in international and regional standards organizations, and encourages the adoption of international standards as national standards where appropriate.

The Institute is the official U.S. representative to the two major international standards organizations, the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), as a founding member,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansi.org/about_ansi/introduction/introduction.aspx ISO founding member]- Retrieved 2011-09-27&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC), via the U.S. National Committee (USNC). ANSI participates in almost the entire technical program of both the ISO and the IEC, and administers many key committees and subgroups. In many instances, U.S. standards are taken forward to ISO and IEC, through ANSI or the USNC, where they are adopted in whole or in part as international standards.

===Standards panels&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansi.org/standards_activities/standards_boards_panels/overview.aspx?menuid=3 Overview]. Ansi.org. Retrieved on 2013-08-12.&lt;/ref&gt;===
The Institute administers nine standards panels:
*ANSI Homeland Defense and Security Standardization Collaborative (HDSSC)
*ANSI Nanotechnology Standards Panel (ANSI-NSP)
*ID Theft Prevention and ID Management Standards Panel (IDSP)
*ANSI Energy Efficiency Standardization Coordination Collaborative (EESCC)
*Nuclear Energy Standards Coordination Collaborative (NESCC)
*Electric Vehicles Standards Panel (EVSP)
*ANSI-NAM Network on Chemical Regulation
*ANSI Biofuels Standards Coordination Panel
*Healthcare Information Technology Standards Panel (HITSP)

Each of the panels works to identify, coordinate, and harmonize voluntary standards relevant to these areas.

In 2009, ANSI and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) formed the Nuclear Energy Standards Coordination Collaborative (NESCC). NESCC is a joint initiative to identify and respond to the current need for standards in the nuclear industry.

===American national standards===
*The [[ASA film speed|ASA]] (as for American Standards Association) photographic exposure system, originally defined in ASA Z38.2.1 (since 1943) and ASA PH2.5 (since 1954), together with the [[DIN film speed|DIN system (DIN 4512 since 1934)]], became the basis for the [[ISO film speed|ISO]] system (since 1974), currently used worldwide ([[ISO 6]], [[ISO 2240]], [[ISO 5800]], [[ISO 12232]]).
*A standard for the set of values used to represent characters in digital computers.  The ANSI code standard extended the previously created [[ASCII]] seven bit code standard (ASA X3.4-1963), with additional codes for European alphabets (see also [[Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code]] or EBCDIC).  In [[Microsoft Windows]], the phrase &quot;ANSI&quot; refers to the [[Windows code page|Windows ANSI code page]]s (even though they are not ANSI standards).&lt;ref name=&quot;&quot;ms&quot; glossary&quot;&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/glossary.mspx Microsoft Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these are fixed width, though some characters for [[ideographic language]]s are variable width. Since these characters are based on a draft of the [[ISO-8859]] series, some of Microsoft's symbols are visually very similar to the ISO symbols, leading many to falsely assume that they are identical.
*The first computer [[programming language]] standard was &quot;American Standard [[Fortran]]&quot; (informally known as &quot;FORTRAN 66&quot;), approved in March 1966 and published as ASA X3.9-1966.
*The programming language [[COBOL]] had ANSI standards in 1968, 1974, and 1985. The COBOL 2002 standard was issued by [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]].
*The original standard implementation of the programming language [[C (computer language)|C]] was standardized as ANSI X3.159-1989, becoming the well-known [[ANSI C]].
*A popular [[Unified Thread Standard]] for nuts and bolts is ANSI/ASME B1.1 which was defined in 1935, 1949, 1989, and 2003.
*The ANSI-NSF International standards used for commercial kitchens, such as restaurants, cafeterias, delis, etc.
*The ANSI/APSP (Association of Pool &amp; Spa Professionals) standards used for pools, spas, hot tubs, barriers, and suction entrapment avoidance.
*The ANSI/HI ([[Hydraulic Institute]]) standards used for pumps.
*The ANSI for [[eye protection]] is Z87.1, which gives a specific impact resistance rating to the eyewear. This standard is commonly used for shop glasses, shooting glasses, and many other examples of protective eyewear.
*The [[Paper size#ANSI paper sizes|ANSI paper sizes]] (ANSI/ASME Y14.1).

===Other initiatives===
*In 2008 ANSI, in  partnership&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citationtechnologies.com/alliances/ansi ]{{dead link|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Citation Technologies]], created the first dynamic, online web library for [[ISO 14000]] standards.&lt;ref name=iPackages&gt;[http://ansi.org/news_publications/news_story.aspx?menuid=7&amp;articleid=1892 ANSI ISO 14000 Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt;
*On June 23, 2009 ANSI announced a product and services agreement with [[Citation Technologies]] to deliver all ISO Standards on a web-based platform. Through the ANSI-Citation partnership, 17,765 International Standards developed by more than 3,000 ISO technical bodies will be made available on the citation platform, arming subscribers with powerful search tools and collaboration, notification, and change-management functionality.&lt;ref name=&quot;ANSI Press Release 07.23.09&quot;&gt;[http://www.ansi.org/news_publications/news_story.aspx?menuid=7&amp;articleid=2261 ANSI Press Release 07.23.09]&lt;/ref&gt;
*ANSI, in partnership with [[Citation Technologies]], [[Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation|AAMI]], [[ASTM]], and [[DIN]], created a single, centralized database for medical device standards on September 9, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Medical Device Standards Press Release 09/09/09&quot;&gt;[http://astmnewsroom.org/default.aspx?pageid=1881 Medical Device Standards Database Press Release 09/09/09]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In early 2009, ANSI launched a new Certificate Accreditation Program (ANSI-CAP) to provide neutral, third-party attestation that a given certificate program meets the American National Standard ASTM E2659-09.
*In 2009, ANSI began accepting applications for certification bodies seeking accreditation according to requirements defined under the Toy Safety Certification Program (TSCP) as the official third-party accreditor of TSCP’s product certification bodies.
*In 2006, ANSI launched [http://www.standardsportal.org/ www.StandardsPortal.org], an online resource for facilitating more open and efficient trade between international markets in the areas of standards, conformity assessment, and technical regulations. The site currently features content for China, India, and Korea, with additional countries and regions planned for future content.
*ANSI design standards have also been incorporated into building codes encompassing several specific building sub-sets, such as the ANSI/SPRI ES-1, which pertains to &quot;Wind Design Standard for Edge Systems Used With Low Slope Roofing Systems&quot;, for example.&lt;ref name=&quot;The ANSI/SPRI ES-1 Standard Explained&quot;&gt;[http://www.area-24.com/ANSI_SPRI_ES-1.html The ANSI/SPRI ES-1 Standard Explained]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apollo 11''' was the [[spaceflight]] that [[Moon landing|landed]] the first humans on the [[Moon]], Americans [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]], on July 20, 1969, at 20:18 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]. Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later on July 21 at 02:56 UTC. Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less, and together they collected {{convert|47.5|lb|kg}} of lunar material for return to Earth. A third member of the mission, [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]], piloted the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|command spacecraft]] alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to Earth.

Launched by a [[Saturn V]] rocket from [[Kennedy Space Center]] in [[Merritt Island, Florida]], on July 16, Apollo 11 was the fifth manned mission of [[NASA]]'s [[Apollo program]]. The Apollo [[Apollo (spacecraft)|spacecraft]] had three parts: a [[Command Module#Command Module (CM)|Command Module]] (CM) with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on Earth; a [[Command Module#Service Module (SM)|Service Module]] (SM), which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] (LM) for landing on the Moon. After being sent toward the Moon by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the [[Mare Tranquillitatis|Sea of Tranquility]]. They stayed a total of about 21½ hours on the lunar surface. After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module, they returned to Earth and landed in the [[Pacific Ocean]] on July 24.

Broadcast on live TV to a world-wide audience, Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface and described the event as &quot;one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.&quot; Apollo 11 effectively ended the [[Space Race]] and fulfilled a national goal proposed in 1961 by the late [[President of the United States|US President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] in a speech before the [[United States Congress]], &quot;before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/space/05/25/kennedy.moon/ |title=Man on the Moon: Kennedy speech ignited the dream |work=CNN |last=Stenger |first=Richard |date=May 25, 2001 |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20100606035837/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/space/05/25/kennedy.moon/ |archivedate=June 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each crewman of Apollo 11 had made a spaceflight before this mission, making it only the second all-veteran crew (the other being [[Apollo 10]]) in human spaceflight history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brooks |first1=Courtney G. |last2=Grimwood |first2=James M. |last3=Swenson |first3=Loyd S., Jr. |others=Foreword by [[Samuel C.

Collins was originally slated to be the Command Module Pilot (CMP) on [[Apollo 8]] but was removed when he required surgery on his back and was replaced by [[Jim Lovell]], his backup for that flight. After Collins was medically cleared, he took what would have been Lovell's spot on Apollo 11; as a veteran of Apollo 8, Lovell was transferred to Apollo 11's backup crew, but promoted to backup commander.

In early 1969, Anders accepted a job with the [[National Space Council]] effective August 1969 and announced that he would retire as an astronaut on that date. At that point [[Ken Mattingly]] was moved from the support crew into parallel training with Anders as backup Command Module Pilot in case Apollo 11 was delayed past its intended July launch (at which point Anders would be unavailable if needed) and would later join Lovell's crew and ultimately be assigned as the original [[Apollo 13]] CMP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Deke!

After the crew of Apollo 10 named their spacecraft ''Charlie Brown'' and ''Snoopy'', assistant manager for public affairs Julian Scheer wrote to [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Manned Spacecraft Center]] director [[George M. Low]] to suggest the Apollo 11 crew be less flippant in naming their craft. During early mission planning, the names ''Snowcone'' and ''Haystack'' were used and put in the news release,&lt;ref name=&quot;Snowcone&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.nasa.gov/ap11fj/pdf/a11-techsum.pdf |title=Technical Information Summary, Apollo-11 (AS-506) Apollo Saturn V Space Vehicle |date=June 25, 1969 |work=[[Marshall Space Flight Center|George C.

The Command Module was named ''[[Columbia (name)|Columbia]]'' after the ''[[Columbiad#In fiction|Columbiad]]'', the giant cannon shell &quot;spacecraft&quot; fired by a giant cannon (also from Florida) in [[Jules Verne|Jules Verne's]] 1865 novel ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Farmer |first1=Gene |last2=Hamblin |first2=Dora Jane |last3=Armstrong |first3=Neil |authorlink3=Neil Armstrong |last4=Collins |first4=Michael |last5=Aldrin |first5=Edwin E., Jr. |title=[[First on the Moon (1970 book)|First on the Moon: A Voyage with Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, Edwin E.

===Insignia===
&lt;!--[[File:Apollo 11 insignia.png|thumb|upright=0.45|left|Mission insignia]] Shown in infobox--&gt;
The Apollo 11 mission insignia was designed by Collins, who wanted a symbol for &quot;peaceful lunar landing by the United States&quot;. He chose an eagle as the symbol, put an [[olive branch]] in its beak, and drew a lunar background with the Earth in the distance. NASA officials said the talons of the eagle looked too &quot;warlike&quot; and after some discussion, the olive branch was moved to the claws. The crew decided the [[Roman numeral]] [[11 (number)|XI]] would not be understood in some nations and went with &quot;Apollo 11&quot;; they decided not to put their names on the patch, so it would &quot;be representative of ''everyone'' who had worked toward a lunar landing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Collins |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Collins (astronaut) |others=Foreword by [[Charles Lindberg]] |origyear=Originally published 1974; New York: [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] |year=2001 |title=Carrying the Fire: An Astronaut's Journeys |publisher=Cooper Square Press |location=New York |isbn=0-8154-1028-X |lccn=2001017080 |pages=332–333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All colors are natural, with blue and gold borders around the [[Mission patch|patch]]. When the [[Eisenhower Dollar|Eisenhower dollar coin]] was released a few years later, the patch design provided the eagle for its reverse side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://coinsite.com/CoinSite-PF/pparticles/$1eisen.asp |title=1971–78 Dollar Eisenhower |work=CoinSite |publisher=ROKO Design Group, Inc. |year=1994 |accessdate=July 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design was retained for the smaller [[Susan B.

In addition to throngs of people crowding highways and beaches near the launch site, millions watched the event on television, with NASA Chief of Public Information [[Jack King (NASA)|Jack King]] providing commentary. [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon|Richard M. Nixon]] viewed the proceedings from the [[Oval Office]] of the [[White House]].

A [[Saturn V]] launched Apollo 11 from Launch Pad 39A, part of the Launch Complex 39 site at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] on July 16, 1969 at 13:32:00 UTC (9:32:00 a.m. EDT local time). It entered orbit twelve minutes later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orloff&quot; /&gt; After one and a half orbits, the [[S-IVB]] third-stage engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the Moon with the [[Trans-lunar injection|Trans-Lunar Injection]] (TLI) burn at 16:22:13 UTC. About 30 minutes later the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|command/service module]] pair separated from this last remaining Saturn V stage and docked with the Lunar Module still nestled in the [[Apollo spacecraft#Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter (SLA)|Lunar Module Adaptor]]. After the Lunar Module was extracted, the combined spacecraft headed for the Moon, while the third stage booster flew on a trajectory past the Moon and into [[heliocentric orbit]].&lt;ref name=&quot;A11timeline&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Orloff |first=Richard W. |title=Apollo by the Numbers: A Statistical Reference |url=http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/SP-4029.htm |accessdate=October 30, 2009 |series=NASA History Series |origyear=First published 2000 |date=September 2004 |work=NASA History Division, Office of Policy and Plans |publisher=NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=0-16-050631-X |lccn= 00-061677 |id=NASA SP-2000-4029 |chapter=Apollo 11 Timeline |chapterurl=http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_11i_Timeline.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lunar descent===
[[File:Apollo 11 Lunar Module Eagle in landing configuration in lunar orbit from the Command and Service Module Columbia.jpg|thumb|The ''Eagle'' in [[lunar orbit]] after separating from ''Columbia'']]

On July 20, 1969, the Lunar Module ''Eagle'' separated from the Command Module ''Columbia''. Collins, alone aboard ''Columbia'', inspected ''Eagle'' as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged.

As the descent began, Armstrong and Aldrin found that they were passing landmarks on the surface four seconds early and reported that they were &quot;long&quot;; they would land miles west of their target point.

Five minutes into the descent burn, and {{convert|6000|ft|m|-2}} above the surface of the Moon, the [[Apollo Guidance Computer|LM navigation and guidance computer]] distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected &quot;1202&quot; and &quot;1201&quot; program alarms.

In a letter to ''[[Datamation]]'', March 1, 1971, [[Margaret Hamilton (scientist)|Margaret H. Hamilton]], Director of Apollo Flight Computer Programming MIT Draper Laboratory, Cambridge, Massachusetts, stated: &quot;Due to an error in the checklist manual, the rendezvous radar switch was placed in the wrong position. This caused it to send erroneous signals to the computer. The result was that the computer was being asked to perform all of its normal functions for landing while receiving an extra load of spurious data which used up 15% of its time. The computer (or rather the software in it) was smart enough to recognize that it was being asked to perform more tasks than it should be performing. It then sent out an alarm, which meant to the astronaut, ''I'm overloaded with more tasks than I should be doing at this time and I'm going to keep only the more important tasks''; i.e., the ones needed for landing&amp;nbsp;... Actually, the computer was programmed to do more than recognize error conditions. A complete set of recovery programs was incorporated into the software. The software's action, in this case, was to eliminate lower priority tasks and re-establish the more important ones&amp;nbsp;... If the computer hadn't recognized this problem and taken recovery action, I doubt if Apollo 11 would have been the successful [M]oon landing it was.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamilton |first=Margaret H. |authorlink=Margaret Hamilton (scientist) |date=March 1, 1971 |title=Computer Got Loaded |journal=[[Datamation]] |publisher=[[Norman Cahners|Cahners Publishing Company]] |type=Letter |issn=0011-6963}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|During the mission, the cause was diagnosed as the rendezvous radar switch being in the wrong position, causing the computer to process data from both the rendezvous and landing radars at the same time, as stated in the letter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apollo 11 Mission Report&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Apollo 11 Mission Report |url=http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/A11_MissionReport.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=July 10, 2013 |date=November 1969 |work=[[Lyndon B.

Having the rendezvous radar on (so that it was warmed up in case of an emergency landing abort) should have been irrelevant to the computer, but an electrical phasing mismatch between two parts of the rendezvous radar system could cause the stationary antenna to appear to the computer as dithering back and forth between two positions, depending upon how the hardware randomly powered up. The extra spurious [[cycle stealing]], as the rendezvous radar updated an involuntary counter, caused the computer alarms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eyles&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://klabs.org/history/apollo_11_alarms/eyles_2004/eyles_2004.htm |title=Tales from the Lunar Module Guidance Computer |last=Eyles |first=Don |date=February 6, 2004 |work=27th annual Guidance and Control Conference |publisher=[[American Astronautical Society]] |location=Breckenridge, CO |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Apollo onboard flight software for both the CM and LM was developed using an asynchronous executive so that higher priority jobs could interrupt lower priority jobs. The sequence that occurred in the Apollo 11 landing was successful because of its global error detection and recovery system. This included the restart capability to &quot;kill and start over again&quot; and recompute and the display interface routines (&quot;priority displays&quot;) providing the ability, in the case of an emergency, to interrupt nominal displays with higher priority alarm displays. Steps previously taken to create solutions that took advantage of this multiprogramming environment suggested solutions for multiprocessing. Although only one process is actively executing at a given time in a multiprogramming environment, other processes in the same system―sleeping or waiting―exist in parallel with the executing process. With this as a backdrop, the priority display mechanisms were created, essentially changing the man-machine interface between the astronauts and the onboard flight software from synchronous to asynchronous displays so that a mission could be reconfigured in real time should it become necessary to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hamilton |first1=Margaret H. |last2=Hackler |first2=William R. |date=December 2008 |title=Universal Systems Language: Lessons Learned from Apollo |volume=41 |issue=12 |pages=34–43 |journal=Computer |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[IEEE Computer Society]] |issn=0018-9162 |doi=10.1109/MC.2008.541 |url=http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MC.2008.541 |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Landing===
[[File:Apollo-11-landing-site.png|thumb|Alt=image of the Moon showing landing site of Apollo 11 around center of the Moon|Landing site of Apollo 11 at Sea of Tranquility]]
When Armstrong again looked outside, he saw that the computer's landing target was in a boulder-strewn area just north and east of a {{convert|300|m|ft|sp=us|adj=on|sp=us}} diameter crater (later determined to be &quot;West crater,&quot; named for its location in the western part of the originally planned landing ellipse). Armstrong took semi-automatic control&lt;ref name=&quot;Digital Apollo&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mindell |first=David A. |title=Digital Apollo: Human and Machine in Spaceflight |year=2008 |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |location=Cambridge, MA |pages= 195–197 |isbn=978-0-262-13497-2 |lccn=2007032255}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, with Aldrin calling out altitude and velocity data, landed at 20:17:40 UTC on July 20 with about 25 seconds of fuel left.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 1&quot; /&gt;

Apollo 11 landed with less fuel than other missions, and the astronauts encountered a premature low fuel warning. This was later found to be the result of greater propellant 'slosh' than expected, uncovering a fuel sensor. On subsequent missions, extra anti-slosh baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 1&quot; /&gt;

Throughout the descent Aldrin had called out navigation data to Armstrong, who was busy piloting the [[Apollo Lunar Module|LM]]. A few moments before the landing, a light informed Aldrin that at least one of the {{convert|67|in|cm|0|adj=on}} probes hanging from ''Eagle'''s footpads had touched the surface, and he said &quot;Contact light!&quot; Three seconds later, ''Eagle'' landed and Armstrong said &quot;Shutdown.&quot; Aldrin immediately said &quot;Okay, engine stop. ACA - out of [[detent]].&quot; Armstrong acknowledged &quot;Out of detent. Auto&quot; and Aldrin continued &quot;Mode control - both auto. Descent engine command override off. Engine arm - off. 413 is in.&quot;

[[Charles Duke]], acting as CAPCOM during the landing phase, acknowledged their landing by saying &quot;We copy you down, Eagle.&quot;

Armstrong acknowledged Aldrin's completion of the post landing checklist with &quot;Engine arm is off,&quot; before responding to Duke with the words, &quot;Houston, [[Tranquility Base]] here. The ''Eagle'' has landed.&quot; Armstrong's unrehearsed&lt;ref name=&quot;failure&quot;&gt;''Failure is Not an Option''. [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]], 24 August 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; change of call sign from &quot;Eagle&quot; to &quot;Tranquility Base&quot; emphasized to listeners that landing was complete and successful. Duke mispronounced his reply as he expressed the relief at Mission Control: &quot;Roger, Twan-- Tranquility, we copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again. Thanks a lot.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.landing.html |title=The First Lunar Landing |year=1995 |editor-last= Jones |editor-first=Eric M. |work=Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Journal |publisher=NASA |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/moonlandings/7630.shtml?all=2&amp;id=7630 |title=James May speaks to Charles Duke |year=2009 |work=[[BBC Archives]] |publisher=[[BBC]] |location=[[Perivale]] |accessdate=June 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two and a half hours after landing, before preparations began for the EVA, Aldrin broadcast that:

[[File:AP11 FINAL APPROACH.ogv|thumb|left|Landing on the Moon, July 20, 1969]]

{{quote|&quot;This is the LM pilot. I'd like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in, whoever and wherever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in his or her own way.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.postland.html |title=Post-landing Activities |year=1995 |editor-last=Jones |editor-first=Eric M. |work=Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Journal |publisher=NASA |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} He then took [[Eucharist|communion]] privately. At this time NASA was still fighting a lawsuit brought by atheist [[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]] (who had objected to the Apollo 8 crew reading from the [[Book of Genesis]]) demanding that their astronauts refrain from broadcasting religious activities while in space. As such, Aldrin chose to refrain from directly mentioning taking communion on the Moon. Aldrin was an elder at the [[Webster, Texas|Webster]] [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Church]], and his communion kit was prepared by the pastor of the church, the Rev. Dean Woodruff. Aldrin described communion on the Moon and the involvement of his church and pastor in the October 1970 edition of ''Guideposts'' magazine and in his book ''Return to Earth''. Webster Presbyterian possesses the chalice used on the Moon and commemorates the event each year on the Sunday closest to July 20.&lt;ref name=&quot;chaikin&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Chaikin, Andrew |title=A Man on the Moon: The Triumphant Story Of The Apollo Space Program |year=1994 |publisher=[[Penguin Group]] |location=New York |pages=204, 623 |isbn=0-14-027201-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The schedule for the mission called for the astronauts to follow the landing with a five-hour sleep period, since they had been awake since early morning. However, they elected to forgo the sleep period and begin the preparations for the EVA early, thinking that they would be unable to sleep.

At 02:39 UTC on Monday July 21, 1969, Armstrong opened the hatch, and at 02:51 UTC began his descent to the lunar surface. The Remote Control Unit controls on his chest kept him from seeing his feet. Climbing down the nine-rung ladder, Armstrong pulled a D-ring to deploy the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA) folded against ''Eagle'''s side and activate the TV camera, and at 02:56:15  UTC he set his left foot on the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;neil82&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Neil Armstrong, first man to step on the Moon, dies at 82 |first=Paul |last=Duggan |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/neil-armstrong-first-man-to-step-on-the-moon-dies-at-82/2012/08/25/7091c8bc-412d-11e0-a16f-4c3fe0fd37f0_story.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=August 25, 2012 |accessdate=May 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 4&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.step.html |title=One Small Step |year=1995 |editor-last=Jones |editor-first=Eric M. |work=Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Journal |publisher=NASA |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first landing used [[slow-scan television]] incompatible with commercial TV, so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor, significantly reducing the quality of the picture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunder 5&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=One giant blunder for mankind: how NASA lost Moon pictures |last=Macey |first=Richard |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/one-giant-blunder-for-mankind-how-nasa-lost-moon-pictures/2006/08/04/1154198328978.html |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |publisher=[[Fairfax Media]] |location=Sydney |date=August 5, 2006 |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The signal was received at [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone]] in the United States but with better fidelity by [[Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station]] in Australia.

About seven minutes after stepping onto the Moon's surface, Armstrong collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick. He then folded the bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh. This was to guarantee there would be some lunar soil brought back in case an emergency required the astronauts to abandon the EVA and return to the LM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/lsc/10010.pdf |title=Lunar Sample Compendium: Contingency Soil (10010) |last=Meyer |first=Charles |year=2009 |work=Astromaterials Research &amp; Exploration Science |publisher=NASA |format=PDF |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to fulfilling President Kennedy's mandate to land a man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Events of 1969: Apollo 11 |url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/Audio/Events-of-1969/Apollo-11/ |work=UPI.com |publisher=[[United Press International]] |year=1969 |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo 11 was an engineering test of the Apollo system; therefore, Armstrong snapped photos of the LM so engineers would be able to judge its post-landing condition. He removed the TV camera from the MESA and made a panoramic sweep, then mounted it on a tripod {{convert|68|ft|m}} from the LM. The TV camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the EVA.

[[File:Aldrin Apollo 11 original.jpg|thumb|Aldrin poses on the Moon, allowing Armstrong to photograph both of them using the visor's reflection]]

Armstrong said that moving in the [[Gravitation of the Moon|lunar gravity]], one-sixth of Earth's, was &quot;even perhaps easier than the simulations&amp;nbsp;... It's absolutely no trouble to walk around.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 4&quot;/&gt; Aldrin joined him on the surface and tested methods for moving around, including two-footed kangaroo hops. The PLSS backpack created a tendency to tip backwards, but neither astronaut had serious problems maintaining balance. Loping became the preferred method of movement. The astronauts reported that they needed to plan their movements six or seven steps ahead. The fine soil was quite slippery. Aldrin remarked that moving from sunlight into ''Eagle'''s shadow produced no temperature change inside the suit, though the helmet was warmer in sunlight, so he felt cooler in shadow.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 4&quot;/&gt;

The astronauts planted a [[Lunar Flag Assembly|specially designed U.S. flag]] on the lunar surface, in clear view of the TV camera. Some time later, President Richard Nixon spoke to them through a telephone-radio transmission which Nixon called &quot;the most historic phone call ever made from the White House.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/american_originals/apollo11.html |title=Exhibit: Apollo 11 and Nixon |date=March 1996 |work=American Originals |publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]] |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=April 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon originally had a long speech prepared to read during the phone call, but [[Frank Borman]], who was at the White House as a NASA liaison during Apollo 11, convinced Nixon to keep his words brief, to respect the lunar landing as Kennedy's legacy.&lt;ref&gt;This was related by Frank Borman during the 2008 documentary ''[[When We Left Earth: The NASA Missions]]'', part 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Safire]] prepared a speech called ''In Event of Moon Disaster'' for President Nixon to read on television if the Apollo 11 astronauts were stranded on the Moon.&lt;ref name=&quot;lostinspace&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/white-house-lost-space-scenarios |title=White House 'Lost In Space' Scenarios |date=August 8, 2005 |work=[[The Smoking Gun]] |publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] |location=New York |accessdate=May 25, 2013}} Scanned copy of the &quot;In Event of Moon Disaster&quot; memo.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the plans, Mission Control would &quot;close down communications&quot; with the LEM, and a clergyman would have commended their souls to &quot;the deepest of the deep&quot; in a public ritual likened to [[burial at sea]]. Presidential telephone calls to the astronauts' wives were also planned. The speech originated in a memo from Safire to Nixon's [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[H. R. Haldeman]] in which Safire suggested a protocol the administration might follow in reaction to such a disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Story of a Tragedy That Was Not to Be |first=Jim |last=Mann |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jul/07/news/mn-53678 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=July 7, 1999 |accessdate=May 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;safire&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Essay; Disaster Never Came |first=William |last=Safire |authorlink=William Safire |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/12/opinion/essay-disaster-never-came.html |work=[[New York Times]] |date=July 12, 1999 |accessdate=May 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last line of the prepared text contained an allusion to [[Rupert Brooke]]'s [[World War I|First World War]] poem, &quot;[[The Soldier (poem)|The Soldier]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;safire&quot;/&gt;

The MESA failed to provide a stable work platform and was in shadow, slowing work somewhat. As they worked, the moonwalkers kicked up gray dust which soiled the outer part of their suits, the integrated thermal meteoroid garment.

They deployed the EASEP, which included a passive seismograph and a [[Lunar Laser Ranging experiment|Lunar Ranging]] [[Retroreflector#Retroreflectors on the Moon|Retroreflector]] (LRRR). Then Armstrong walked {{convert|196|ft|m}} from the LM to snap photos at the rim of Little West Crater &lt;!-- There is no &quot;East Crater&quot;, see http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11EastCraterRIP.html --&gt; while Aldrin collected two core tubes. He used the [[geological hammer]] to pound in the tubes - the only time the hammer was used on Apollo 11. The astronauts then collected rock samples using scoops and tongs on extension handles. Many of the surface activities took longer than expected, so they had to stop documenting sample collection halfway through the allotted 34 minutes.

[[File:Apollo 11 photo map.pdf|thumb|Map showing landing site and photos taken]]
Three new minerals were discovered in the rock samples collected by the astronauts: [[armalcolite]], [[tranquillityite]], and [[pyroxferroite]]. Armalcolite was named after Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins.

During this period Mission Control used a coded phrase to warn Armstrong that his metabolic rates were high and that he should slow down. He was moving rapidly from task to task as time ran out. However, as metabolic rates remained generally lower than expected for both astronauts throughout the walk, Mission Control granted the astronauts a 15-minute extension.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 5&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.clsout.html |title=EASEP Deployment and Closeout |editor-last=Jones |editor-first=Eric M. |year=1995 |work=Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Journal |publisher=NASA |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2010 interview, Armstrong, who had walked a maximum of {{convert|196|ft|m}} from the LM, explained that NASA limited the first moonwalk's time and distance because there was no empirical proof of how much cooling water the astronauts' PLSS backpacks would consume to handle their body heat generation while working on the Moon.&lt;ref name=&quot;neilmoonwalk&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/10469-neil-armstrong-explains-famous-apollo-11-moonwalk.html |title=Neil Armstrong Explains His Famous Apollo 11 Moonwalk |date=December 10, 2010 |work=[[space.com]] |publisher=[[TechMediaNetwork, Inc.]] |location=New York |accessdate=May 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lunar ascent and return===
[[File:Aldrin with experiment.jpg|thumb|Aldrin next to the Passive Seismic Experiment Package with ''Eagle'' in the background]]

Aldrin entered ''Eagle'' first. With some difficulty the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing more than {{convert|22|kg|lb}} of lunar surface material to the LM hatch using a flat cable pulley device called the Lunar Equipment Conveyor. Armstrong reminded Aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his suit pocket sleeve, and Aldrin tossed the bag down; Armstrong then jumped to the ladder's third rung and climbed into the LM. After transferring to LM [[life support]], the explorers lightened the ascent stage for return to lunar orbit by tossing out their PLSS backpacks, lunar overshoes, one [[Hasselblad]] camera, and other equipment. They then pressurized the LM, and settled down to sleep.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 6&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.posteva.html |title=Trying to Rest |editor-last=Jones |editor-first=Eric M. |year=1995 |work=Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Journal |publisher=NASA |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While moving within the cabin, Aldrin accidentally broke the [[circuit breaker]] that would arm the main engine for lift off from the Moon. There was concern this would prevent firing the engine, stranding them on the Moon. Fortunately a felt-tip pen was sufficient to activate the switch.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 6&quot; /&gt; Had this not worked, the Lunar Module circuitry could have been reconfigured to allow firing the ascent engine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Murray |first1=Charles A. |authorlink1=Charles Murray (author) |last2=Cox |first2=Catherine Bly | title=Apollo: The Race to the Moon |year=1989 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York|isbn=0-671-61101-1 |lccn=89006333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After about seven hours of rest, the crew was awakened by Houston to prepare for the return flight. Two and a half hours later, at 17:54 UTC, they lifted off in ''Eagle'''s ascent stage, carrying 21.5 kilograms of lunar samples with them, to rejoin CMP Michael Collins aboard ''Columbia'' in lunar orbit. During the launch Aldrin looked up in time to see the exhaust from the ascent module's engine knock over the American flag they had planted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orloff&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Apollo 11 plaque closeup on Moon.jpg|left|thumb|The plaque left on the ladder of ''Eagle'']]

After more than 2½ hours on the lunar surface, they had left behind scientific instruments that included a [[Retroreflector#Retroreflectors on the Moon|retroreflector]] array used for the [[Lunar Laser Ranging experiment|Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment]] and a Passive Seismic Experiment Package used to measure [[Quake (natural phenomenon)#Moonquake|moonquakes]]. They also left an American flag, an Apollo 1 mission patch, and a [[lunar plaque|plaque]] (mounted on the LM Descent Stage ladder) bearing two drawings of Earth (of the Western and Eastern Hemispheres), an inscription, and signatures of the astronauts and President Nixon. The inscription read:
{{quote|''Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon, July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.''}}
They also left behind a memorial bag containing a gold replica of an olive branch as a traditional symbol of peace and a silicon message disk. The disk carries the [[Apollo 11 goodwill messages|goodwill statements]] by Presidents [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]], Kennedy, [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]], and Nixon and messages from leaders of 73 countries around the world. The disc also carries a listing of the leadership of the US Congress, a listing of members of the four committees of the House and Senate responsible for the NASA legislation, and the names of NASA's past and present top management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Apollo 11 Goodwill Messages |date=July 13, 1969 |publisher=NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |url=http://history.nasa.gov/ap11-35ann/goodwill/Apollo_11_material.pdf |format=PDF |id=Release No: 69-83F |accessdate=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In his 1989 book, ''Men from Earth'', Aldrin says that the items included Soviet medals commemorating [[Cosmonaut]]s [[Vladimir Mikhaylovich Komarov|Vladimir Komarov]] and [[Yuri Gagarin]].) Also, according to Deke Slayton's book ''Moonshot'', Armstrong carried with him a special diamond-studded astronaut pin from Slayton.

[[File:Apollo 11 lunar module.jpg|thumb|''Eagle'''s ascent stage approaching ''Columbia'']]

Film taken from the LM Ascent Stage upon liftoff from the Moon reveals the American flag, planted some {{Convert|25|ft|m|0}} from the descent stage, whipping violently in the exhaust of the ascent stage engine. Buzz Aldrin witnessed it topple: &quot;The ascent stage of the LM separated&amp;nbsp;... I was concentrating on the computers, and Neil was studying the [[attitude indicator]], but I looked up long enough to see the flag fall over.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Apollo-11 (27)&quot; /&gt; Subsequent Apollo missions usually planted the American flags at least {{Convert|100|ft|m|sigfig=1}} from the LM to prevent its being blown over by the ascent engine exhaust.

After rendezvous with ''Columbia'', ''Eagle''{{'}}s ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit on July 21, 1969 at 23:41 UTC. Just before the [[Apollo 12]] flight, it was noted that ''Eagle'' was still likely to be orbiting the Moon. Later NASA reports mentioned that ''Eagle'''s orbit had decayed, resulting in it impacting in an &quot;uncertain location&quot; on the lunar surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apollo_tables.html |title=Apollo Tables |last=Williams |first=David R. |work=[[National Space Science Data Center]] |publisher=NASA |accessdate=September 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The location is uncertain because the ''Eagle'' ascent stage was not tracked after it was jettisoned, and the lunar gravity field is sufficiently non-uniform to make the orbit of the spacecraft unpredictable after a short time. NASA estimated that the orbit had decayed within months and would have impacted on the Moon.

On July 23, the last night before splashdown, the three astronauts made a television broadcast in which Collins commented,
:&quot;...&amp;nbsp;The Saturn V rocket which put us in orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery, every piece of which worked flawlessly&amp;nbsp;... We have always had confidence that this equipment will work properly. All this is possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears of a number of a people&amp;nbsp;... All you see is the three of us, but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others, and to all of those, I would like to say, 'Thank you very much.'&quot;

Aldrin added,
:&quot;This has been far more than three men on a mission to the Moon; more, still, than the efforts of a government and industry team; more, even, than the efforts of one nation. We feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown&amp;nbsp;... Personally, in reflecting on the events of the past several days, a verse from Psalms comes to mind. 'When I consider the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the Moon and the stars, which Thou hast ordained; What is man that Thou art mindful of him?'&quot;
Armstrong concluded,
:&quot;The responsibility for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; next with the American people, who have, through their will, indicated their desire; next with four administrations and their Congresses, for implementing that will; and then, with the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little [[Extravehicular Mobility Unit|EMU]], the spacesuit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We would like to give special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft. To those people tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Apollo-11 (27)&quot; /&gt;

On the return to Earth, a bearing at the Guam tracking station failed, potentially preventing communication on the last segment of the Earth return. A regular repair was not possible in the available time but the station director, Charles Force, had his ten-year old son Greg use his small hands to reach into the housing and pack it with grease. Greg later was thanked by Armstrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The 10-year-old who helped Apollo 11, 40 years later |last=Rodriguez |first=Rachel |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/space/07/20/apollo11.irpt/index.html |work=CNN |date=July 20, 2009 |accessdate=January 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Splashdown and quarantine===
[[File:Splashdown 3.jpg|thumb|221px|''Columbia'' floats on the ocean as Navy divers assist in retrieving the astronauts]] 
[[File:Apollo-11-quarantine-7.jpg|right|thumb|The astronauts in their Biological Isolation Garments aboard the [[USS Hornet (CV-12)|USS ''Hornet'']]]]

On July 24, the astronauts returned home aboard the Command Module ''Columbia'' just before dawn local time (16:51 UTC&lt;ref name=&quot;A11timeline&quot; /&gt;) at {{Coord|13|19|N|169|9|W|type:event|name=Apollo 11 splashdown}}, in the Pacific Ocean {{convert|2660|km|nmi|abbr=on}} east of [[Wake Island]], {{convert|380|km|nmi|abbr=on}} south of [[Johnston Atoll]], and {{convert|24|km|nmi|abbr=on}} from the recovery ship, [[USS Hornet (CV-12)|USS ''Hornet'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;Orloff&quot; /&gt;

At 16:44 UTC the [[drogue parachute]]s had been deployed and seven minutes later the Command Module struck the water forcefully. The Command Module landed upside down but was righted within 10 minutes by flotation bags triggered by the astronauts. &quot;Everything's okay. Our checklist is complete. Awaiting swimmers,&quot; was Armstrong's last official transmission from the ''Columbia''. A diver from the Navy helicopter hovering above attached a sea anchor to the Command Module to prevent it from drifting. Additional divers attached flotation collars to stabilize the module and position rafts for astronaut extraction. Though the chance of bringing back [[pathogen]]s from the lunar surface was considered remote, it was considered a possibility and NASA took great precautions at the recovery site. Divers provided the astronauts with Biological Isolation Garments (BIGs) which were worn until they reached isolation facilities on board the ''Hornet''. Additionally astronauts were rubbed down with a [[sodium hypochlorite]] solution and the Command Module wiped with [[Betadine]] to remove any lunar dust that might be present. The raft containing decontamination materials was then intentionally sunk.&lt;ref name=&quot;hornet&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Fish |first=Bob |others=Foreword by [[Richard F. Gordon, Jr.|Richard Gordon]] |title=Hornet Plus Three: The Story of the Apollo 11 Recovery |edition=1st |year=2009 |publisher=Creative Minds Press |location=Reno, NV |isbn=978-0-9749610-7-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second [[Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King|Sea King]] helicopter hoisted the astronauts aboard one by one, where a NASA [[flight surgeon]] gave each a brief physical check during the {{convert|0.5|nmi|m}} trip back to the ''Hornet''.

[[File:Apollo 11 crew in quarantine.jpg|thumb|left|The crew of Apollo 11 in [[quarantine]] after returning to Earth, visited by Richard Nixon]]

After touchdown on the ''Hornet'', the astronauts exited the helicopter, leaving the flight surgeon and three crewmen. The helicopter was then lowered into hangar bay #2 where the astronauts walked the {{convert|30|ft|m}} to the [[Mobile Quarantine Facility]] (MQF) where they would begin their 21 days of quarantine. This practice would continue for two more Apollo missions, Apollo 12 and [[Apollo 14]], before the Moon was proven to be barren of life and the quarantine process dropped.&lt;ref name=&quot;hornet&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smithsonian &quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/apollo-to-the-moon/online/a11.jh.3.html |title=After Splashdown |date=July 1999 |work=Apollo to the Moon |publisher=[[National Air and Space Museum]] |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Richard Nixon was aboard ''Hornet'' to personally welcome the astronauts back to Earth. He told the astronauts, &quot;As a result of what you've done, the world has never been closer together before.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thenewnixon.org/2008/07/23/24-july-1969-home-from-the-moon/ |title=24 July 1969: Home From The Moon |last=Gannon |first=Frank |date=July 23, 2008 |work=The New Nixon |publisher=[[Richard Nixon Foundation]] |accessdate=July 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Nixon departed, the ''Hornet'' was brought alongside the five-ton Command Module where it was placed aboard by the ship's crane, placed on a dolly and moved next to the MQF. The ''Hornet'' sailed for [[Pearl Harbor]] where the Command Module and MQF were airlifted to the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Johnson Space Center]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hornet&quot; /&gt;

Years later, it was publicly revealed that Nixon had prepared a speech to be given in the event the Lunar Module had failed to lift off from the lunar surface, which would have resulted in Armstrong's and Aldrin's deaths, similar to common [[Obituary#Media|newspaper obituary]] or government [[contingency plan]] procedures and policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A silent death |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/390634.stm  |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |location=London |date=July 10, 1999 |accessdate=January 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Full text: Nixon's unused Apollo speech |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/390933.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |location=London |date=July 10, 1999 |accessdate=March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with the recently passed [[Extra-Terrestrial Exposure Law]], the astronauts were placed in quarantine for fear that the Moon might contain undiscovered [[pathogen]]s and that the astronauts might have been exposed to them during their Moon walks. However, after almost three weeks in confinement (first in their trailer and later in the [[Lunar Receiving Laboratory]] at the Manned Spacecraft Center), the astronauts were given a clean bill of health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaexplores.com/extras/apollo11/hirasaki.html |title=A Front Row Seat For History |date=July 15, 2004 |work=NASAexplores |publisher=NASA |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20060319184027/http://www.nasaexplores.com/extras/apollo11/hirasaki.html |archivedate=March 19, 2006 |accessdate=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 10, 1969, the astronauts exited quarantine.

===Celebration===
[[File:New York City Welcomes the Apollo 11 Astronauts - GPN-2002-000034.jpg|thumb|Parade in New York]]
On August 13, they rode in parades in their honor in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. On the same evening in Los Angeles there was an official [[State dinner|State Dinner]] to celebrate the flight, attended by members of Congress, 44 governors, the [[Chief Justice of the United States]], and ambassadors from 83 nations at the [[Century Plaza Hotel]]. President Richard Nixon and [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Spiro Agnew|Spiro T. Agnew]] honored each astronaut with a presentation of the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]]. This celebration was the beginning of a 45-day &quot;Giant Leap&quot; tour that brought the astronauts to 25 foreign countries and included visits with prominent leaders such as [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] of the United Kingdom. Many nations honored the first manned [[Moon landing]] with special features in magazines or by issuing Apollo 11 commemorative postage stamps or coins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article43460781 |title=The Australian Women's Weekly. |newspaper=[[Australian Women's Weekly|The Australian Women's Weekly (1933 - 1982)]] |location=1933–1982 |date=23 July 1969 |accessdate=19 July 2013 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Wayback |url=http://www.lunarhall.org/missions/apollo/11.html |title=Lunar Hall of Fame: Apollo 11 |date=20081024222503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 16, 1969, the three astronauts spoke before a [[joint session of the United States Congress|joint session of Congress]] on [[Capitol Hill]]. They presented two US flags, one to the House of Representatives and the other to the Senate, that had been carried to the surface of the Moon with them.

==Moon race==
[[File:Luna-16.jpg|thumb|180px|Artist's impression of Luna 15]]

The [[Soviet Union]] was secretly attempting to compete with the US in landing a man on the Moon but had been hampered by repeated failures in development of [[N1 (rocket)|a launcher comparable to the Saturn V]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sovlun&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/science-technology-and-society/sts-471j-engineering-apollo-the-moon-project-as-a-complex-system-spring-2007/readings/soviet_mand_lunr.pdf |title=The Soviet Manned Lunar Program |last=Lindroos |first=Marcus |work=[[MIT OpenCourseWare]] |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] |format=PDF |accessdate=October 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, they tried to beat the US to return lunar material to the Earth by means of [[Unmanned spacecraft|unmanned probes]]. On July 13, three days before Apollo 11's launch, they launched [[Luna 15]], which reached lunar orbit before Apollo 11. During descent, a malfunction caused Luna 15 to crash in [[Mare Crisium]] about two hours before Armstrong and Aldrin took off from the surface. The [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]] radio telescope in England was later discovered to have recorded transmissions from Luna 15 during its descent, and this was published in July 2009 on the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Recording tracks Russia's Moon gatecrash attempt |first=Jonathan |last=Brown |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/recording-tracks-russias-moon-gatecrash-attempt-1730851.html |work=[[The Independent]] |publisher=Independent Print Limited |location=London |date=July 3, 2009 |accessdate=January 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Command Module is displayed at the [[National Air and Space Museum]], Washington, D.C. It is in the central ''Milestones of Flight'' exhibition hall in front of the Jefferson Drive entrance, sharing the main hall with other pioneering flight vehicles such as the [[Wright Flyer]], the ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]'', the [[Bell X-1]], the [[North American X-15]], [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] spacecraft ''[[Friendship 7]]'', and [[Gemini 4]]. Armstrong's and Aldrin's space suits are displayed in the museum's ''Apollo to the Moon'' exhibit. The quarantine trailer, the flotation collar, and the righting spheres are displayed at the Smithsonian's [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]] annex near [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] in Virginia.

In 2009 the [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]] (LRO) imaged the various Apollo landing sites on the surface of the Moon with sufficient resolution to see the descent stages of the lunar modules, scientific instruments, and foot trails made by the astronauts.

In March 2012 [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] founder [[Jeff Bezos]] located the [[F-1 (rocket engine)|F-1 engines]] that launched Apollo 11 into space.

'''Apollo 8''', the second [[human spaceflight|manned]] mission in the United States [[Apollo program|Apollo space program]], was launched on December 21, 1968, and became the first manned [[spacecraft]] to leave [[Earth]] [[orbit]], reach the Earth's [[Moon]], orbit it and return safely to Earth. The three-[[astronaut]] crew — Commander [[Frank Borman]], Command Module Pilot [[Jim Lovell|James Lovell]], and Lunar Module Pilot [[William Anders]] — became the first humans to travel beyond [[low Earth orbit]], the first to see Earth as a whole planet, and then the first to directly see the [[far side of the Moon]]. The 1968 mission, the third flight of the [[Saturn V|Saturn&amp;nbsp;V]] rocket and the first manned launch of the Saturn V, was also the first manned launch from the [[Kennedy Space Center|John F. Kennedy Space Center]], Florida, located adjacent to [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]].

Originally planned as a second [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]]/[[Apollo Command/Service Module#Command Module (CM)|Command Module]] test in an elliptical [[medium Earth orbit]] in early 1969, the mission profile was changed in August 1968 to a more ambitious Command Module-only [[Lunar orbit|lunar-orbital]] flight to be flown in December, because the Lunar Module (LM) was not yet ready to make its first flight. This meant Borman's crew was scheduled to fly two to three months sooner than originally planned, leaving them a shorter time for training and preparation, thus placing more demands than usual on their time and discipline.

Apollo 8 took three days to travel to the Moon. It orbited ten times over the course of 20&amp;nbsp;hours, during which the crew made a Christmas Eve [[Apollo TV camera|television broadcast]] in which they [[Apollo 8 Genesis reading|read the first 10 verses from]] the [[Book of Genesis]]. At the time, the broadcast was the most watched [[television]] program ever. Apollo&amp;nbsp;8's successful mission paved the way for [[Apollo 11]] to fulfill [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[John F. Kennedy]]'s goal of landing a man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s. The Apollo 8 astronauts returned to Earth on December 27, 1968, when their spacecraft splashed down in the Northern Pacific Ocean.

|flights3_up      = Only

}}
This crew was unique among pre-shuttle era missions in that the commander was not the most experienced member of the crew. This was also the first case of the rarity of an astronaut who had flown as commander subsequently flying as a non-commander, as Lovell had previously commanded Gemini XII.

===Backup crew===
{{Spaceflight crew
|terminology      = Astronaut
|position1        = Commander
|crew1_up         = [[Neil Armstrong|Neil A. Armstrong]]
|flights1_up      =
|position2        = Command Module Pilot
|crew2_up         = [[Buzz Aldrin|Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr.]]
|position3        =  Lunar Module Pilot
|crew3_up         = [[Fred Haise|Fred W. Haise, Jr.]]
}}
On a lunar mission, the Command Module Pilot (CMP) was assigned the role of [[Celestial navigation|navigator]], while the Lunar Module Pilot (LMP) was assigned the role of [[flight engineer]], responsible for monitoring all spacecraft systems, even if the flight didn't include a Lunar Module.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker 1981&quot;&gt;[[#Baker|Baker 1981]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovell was originally the CMP on the back-up crew, with [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] as the prime crew's CMP. However, Collins was replaced in July 1968, after suffering a [[intervertebral disc|cervical]] [[Spinal disc herniation|disc herniation]] that required surgery to repair.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Collins|Collins 2001]], pp. 288–294&lt;/ref&gt;

Edwin Aldrin was originally the backup LMP. When Lovell was rotated to the prime crew, no one with experience on [[Apollo Command/Service Module|CSM]]-103 (the specific spacecraft used for the mission) was available, so Aldrin was moved to CMP and Fred Haise brought in as backup LMP. Neil Armstrong went on to command Apollo 11, where Aldrin was returned to the LMP position and Collins was assigned as CMP.

===Mission control===
The Earth-based mission control teams for Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 consisted of astronauts assigned to the support crew, as well as non-astronaut flight directors and their staffs. The support crew members were not trained to fly the mission, but were able to stand in for astronauts in meetings and be involved in the minutiae of mission planning, while the prime and backup crews trained. They also served as [[Flight controller#Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM)|CAPCOMs]] during the mission. For Apollo&amp;nbsp;8, these crew members included astronauts [[John S. Bull]], [[Vance D. Brand]], [[Gerald P.

===Mission insignia===
The triangular shape of the insignia symbolizes the shape of the Apollo Command Module (CM). It shows a red figure-8 looping around the Earth and Moon representing the mission number as well as the circumlunar nature of the mission. On the red number 8 are the names of the three astronauts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lattimer 1985&quot;&gt;[[#Lattimer|Lattimer 1985]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial design of the insignia was developed by Jim Lovell. Lovell reportedly sketched the initial design while riding in the backseat of a [[Northrop T-38 Talon|T-38]] flight from [[California]] to [[Houston]], shortly after learning of the re-designation of the flight to become a lunar-orbital mission. The graphic design of the insignia was done by Houston artist and animator William Bradley.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lattimer 1985&quot;/&gt;

==Planning==

{{Main|List of Apollo mission types}}

[[Apollo 4]] and [[Apollo 6]] had been &quot;A&quot; missions, unmanned tests of the Saturn V launch vehicle using an unmanned Block&amp;nbsp;I production model of the Apollo Command and Service Module in Earth orbit. {{nowrap|[[Apollo 7]]}}, scheduled for October 1968, would be a manned Earth-orbit flight of the CSM, completing the objectives for Mission&amp;nbsp;&quot;C.&quot;

[[File:Apollo-linedrawing.png|thumb|Apollo CSM diagram]]
Further missions depended on the readiness of the Lunar Module. Apollo 8 was planned as the &quot;D&quot; mission, to test the LM in a low Earth orbit in December 1968 by [[James McDivitt]], [[David Scott]] and [[Rusty Schweickart|Russell Schweickart]], while Borman's crew would fly the &quot;E&quot; mission, a more rigorous LM test in an elliptical medium Earth orbit as Apollo 9, in early 1969.

But production of the LM fell behind schedule, and when Apollo 8's LM arrived at [[Cape Canaveral]] in June 1968, significant defects were discovered, leading [[Grumman]], the lead contractor for the LM, to predict that the first mission-ready LM would not be ready until at least February 1969. This would mean delaying the &quot;D&quot; and subsequent missions, endangering the program's goal of a lunar landing before the end of 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker 1981&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;augsep1968&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ertel |first1=Ivan D. |last2=Newkirk |first2=Roland W. |last3=Brooks |first3=Courtney G. |title=The Apollo Spacecraft: A Chronology |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4009/contents.htm#Volume%20IV |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080205020128/http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4009/contents.htm |archivedate=February 5, 2008 |accessdate=January 29, 2008 |volume=IV |year=1969–1978 |publisher=NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |id=NASA SP-4009 |oclc=23818 |lccn=69-60008 |chapter=Part 2 (N): Recovery, Spacecraft Redefinition, and First Manned Apollo Flight: August through September 1968 |chapterurl=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4009/v4p2n.htm |display-authors=2 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Low]], the Manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, proposed a solution in August to keep the program on track despite the LM delay. Since the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]] (CSM) would be ready three months before the Lunar Module, a CSM-only mission could be flown in December 1968. Instead of just repeating the &quot;C&quot; mission flight of Apollo&amp;nbsp;7, this CSM could be sent all the way to the Moon, with the possibility of entering a lunar orbit. The new mission would also allow NASA to test lunar landing procedures that would otherwise have to wait until [[Apollo 10]], the scheduled &quot;F&quot; mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;augsep1968&quot; /&gt; This also meant that the medium Earth orbit &quot;E&quot; mission could be dispensed with. The net result was that only the &quot;D&quot; mission had to be delayed.

Almost every senior manager at NASA agreed with this new mission, citing both confidence in the hardware and personnel, and the potential for a significant morale boost provided by a circumlunar flight. The only person who needed some convincing was [[James E. Webb]], the NASA administrator. With the rest of his agency in support of the new mission, Webb eventually approved the mission change. The mission was officially changed from a &quot;D&quot; mission to a &quot;C-Prime&quot; lunar-orbit mission, but was still referred to in press releases as an Earth-orbit mission at Webb's direction.&lt;ref name=&quot;chariots11-5&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brooks |first1=Courtney G. |last2=Grimwood |first2=James M. |last3=Swenson |first3=Loyd S., Jr. |others=Foreword by Samuel C.

With the change in mission for Apollo&amp;nbsp;8, Director of Flight Crew Operations [[Deke Slayton]] decided to swap the crews of the D and E missions. This swap also meant a swap of spacecraft, requiring Borman's crew to use CSM-103, while McDivitt's crew would use CSM-104.&lt;ref name=&quot;augsep1968&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chariots11-3&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brooks |first1=Courtney G. |last2=Grimwood |first2=James M. |last3=Swenson |first3=Loyd S., Jr. |others=Foreword by Samuel C.

On September 9, the crew entered the [[Space simulator|simulators]] to begin their preparation for the flight. By the time the mission flew, the crew had spent seven&amp;nbsp;hours training for every actual hour of flight. Although all crew members were trained in all aspects of the mission, it was necessary to specialize. Borman, as commander, was given training on controlling the spacecraft during the [[Atmospheric entry|re-entry]]. Lovell was trained on [[Celestial navigation|navigating]] the spacecraft in case communication was lost with the Earth. Anders was placed in charge of checking that the spacecraft was in working order.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker 1981&quot;/&gt;

Added pressure on the Apollo program to make its 1969 landing goal was provided by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet Union's]] flight of some living creatures, including [[Russian tortoise]]s, in a [[cislunar]] loop around the Moon on [[Zond 5]] and return to Earth on September 21.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Chaikin|Chaikin 1994]], p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; There was speculation within NASA and the press that they might be preparing to launch [[astronaut#Russian|cosmonauts]] on a similar [[Zond program#Circumlunar missions|circumlunar mission]] before the end of 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moon Race 1968&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Poised for the Leap |url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,844661-1,00.html |accessdate=December 15, 2011 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=December 6, 1968 |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Apollo 8 crew, now living in the crew quarters at Kennedy Space Center, received a visit from [[Charles Lindbergh]] and his wife, [[Anne Morrow Lindbergh]], the night before the launch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benke&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Astronauts look back 30 years after historic lunar launch |first=Richard |last=Benke |url=http://cgi.canoe.ca/SpaceArchive/981221_30.html |agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[The Augusta Chronicle]] |publisher=[[Morris Communications]] |location=[[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta, GA]] |date=December 21, 1998 |accessdate=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They talked about how, before his [[Spirit of St. Louis|1927 flight]], Lindbergh had used a piece of string to measure the distance from New York City to Paris on a globe and from that calculated the fuel needed for the flight.

==Saturn V==
{{Main|Saturn V}}
[[File:Ap8-KSC-68PC-147.jpg|thumb|The Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 Saturn V being rolled out to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Pad 39A]]]]
The Saturn&amp;nbsp;V rocket used by Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 was designated SA-503, or the &quot;03rd&quot; model of the Saturn&amp;nbsp;V (&quot;5&quot;) Rocket to be used in the Saturn-Apollo (&quot;SA&quot;) program. When it was erected in the [[Vehicle Assembly Building|Vertical Assembly Building]] on December 20, 1967, it was thought that the rocket would be used for an unmanned Earth-orbit test flight carrying a [[Boilerplate (spaceflight)|boilerplate]] Command/Service Module. Apollo&amp;nbsp;6 had suffered several major problems during its April 1968 flight, including severe [[pogo oscillation]] during its first stage, two second stage engine failures, and a third stage that failed to reignite in orbit. Without assurances that these problems had been rectified, NASA administrators could not justify risking a manned mission until additional unmanned test flights proved that the Saturn&amp;nbsp;V was ready.&lt;ref name=&quot;stages1&quot;&gt;[[#Bilstein|Bilstein 1996]], pp. 360–370&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chariots10-5&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brooks |first1=Courtney G. |last2=Grimwood |first2=James M. |last3=Swenson |first3=Loyd S., Jr. |others=Foreword by Samuel C. Phillips |title=Chariots for Apollo: A History of Manned Lunar Spacecraft |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/cover.html |accessdate=February 1, 2008 |series=NASA History Series |year=1979 |publisher=Scientific and Technical Information Branch, NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-0-486-46756-6 |oclc=4664449 |lccn=79-1042 |id=NASA SP-4205 |chapter=''Apollo 6:'' Saturn V's Shaky Dress Rehearsal |chapterurl=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch10-5.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teams from the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) went to work on the problems. Of primary concern was the pogo oscillation, which would not only hamper engine performance, but could exert significant g-forces on a crew. A task force of contractors, NASA agency representatives, and MSFC researchers concluded that the engines vibrated at a frequency similar to the frequency at which the spacecraft itself vibrated, causing a resonance effect that induced oscillations in the rocket. A system using helium gas to absorb some of these vibrations was installed.&lt;ref name=&quot;stages1&quot; /&gt;

Of equal importance was the failure of three engines during flight. Researchers quickly determined that a leaking hydrogen fuel line ruptured when exposed to vacuum, causing a loss of fuel pressure in engine two. When an automatic shutoff attempted to close the liquid hydrogen valve and shut down engine two, it accidentally shut down engine three's liquid oxygen due to a miswired connection. As a result, engine three failed within one second of engine two's shutdown. Further investigation revealed the same problem for the third-stage engine—a faulty igniter line. The team modified the igniter lines and fuel conduits, hoping to avoid similar problems on future launches.&lt;ref name=&quot;stages1&quot; /&gt;

The teams tested their solutions in August 1968 at the Marshall Space Flight Center. A Saturn stage IC was equipped with shock absorbing devices to demonstrate the team's solution to the problem of pogo oscillation, while a Saturn Stage&amp;nbsp;II was retrofitted with modified fuel lines to demonstrate their resistance to leaks and ruptures in vacuum conditions. Once NASA administrators were convinced that the problems were solved, they gave their approval for a manned mission using SA-503.&lt;ref name=&quot;stages1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;orloff1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Orloff |first=Richard W. |title=Apollo by the Numbers: A Statistical Reference |url=http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/SP-4029.htm |accessdate=June 28, 2013 |series=NASA History Series |origyear=First published 2000 |date=September 2004 |work=NASA History Division, Office of Policy and Plans |publisher=NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=0-16-050631-X |lccn=00-061677 |id=NASA SP-2000-4029 |chapter=Apollo 8 - The Second Mission: Testing the CSM in Lunar Orbit |chapterurl=http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_08a_Summary.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the first manned spacecraft to orbit more than one celestial body, Apollo 8's profile had two different sets of orbital parameters, separated by a translunar injection maneuver.

Apollo lunar missions would begin with a nominal {{convert|100|nmi|km|sigfig=3|adj=on}} circular Earth parking orbit. Apollo 8 was launched into an initial orbit with an [[apogee]] of {{convert|99.99|nmi|km}} and a [[perigee]] of {{convert|99.57|nmi|km}}, with an [[inclination]] of 32.51° to the [[Equator]], and an [[orbital period]] of 88.19&amp;nbsp;minutes. Propellant venting increased the apogee by {{convert|6.4|nmi|km}} over the 2&amp;nbsp;hours, 44&amp;nbsp;minutes and 30&amp;nbsp;seconds spent in the parking orbit.&lt;ref name=&quot;orloff1&quot; /&gt;

This was followed by a [[Trans-lunar injection|Trans-Lunar Injection]] (TLI) burn of the [[S-IVB]] third stage for 318&amp;nbsp;seconds, accelerating the {{convert|63531|lb|kg|abbr=on}} spacecraft from an orbital velocity of {{convert|25567|ft/s|m/s}} to the injection velocity of {{convert|35505|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=&quot;orloff1&quot; /&gt; which set a record for the highest speed, relative to Earth, that humans had ever traveled.&lt;ref name=&quot;chariots11-6&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brooks |first1=Courtney G. |last2=Grimwood |first2=James M. |last3=Swenson |first3=Loyd S., Jr. |others=Foreword by Samuel C.

The standard lunar orbit for Apollo missions was planned as a nominal {{convert|60|nmi|km|adj=on}} circular orbit above the Moon's surface. Initial lunar orbit insertion was an ellipse with a [[perilune]] of {{convert|60.0|nmi|km}} and an [[apolune]] of {{convert|168.5|nmi|km}}, at an inclination of 12° from the lunar equator. This was then circularized at {{convert|60.7|nmi|km}} by {{convert|59.7|nmi|km}}, with an orbital period of 128.7&amp;nbsp;minutes. The effect of lunar [[mass concentration (astronomy)|mass concentrations]] (&quot;masscons&quot;) on the orbit was found to be greater than initially predicted; over the course of the twenty-hour mission, the orbit was perturbated to {{convert|63.6|nmi|km}} by {{convert|58.6|nmi|km}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;orloff1&quot; /&gt;

Apollo 8 achieved a maximum distance from Earth of {{convert |203752 |nmi |statmi km |abbr=off |sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;orloff1&quot; /&gt;

===Launch and trans-lunar injection===
[[File:Ap8-KSC-68PC-329.jpg|thumb|upright|Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 during launch, with a [[Multiple exposure|double exposure]] of the Moon, which was not visible at the time]]
Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 launched at 7:51:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|Eastern Standard Time]] on December 21, 1968, using the Saturn&amp;nbsp;V's three [[Multistage rocket|stages]], [[S-IC]], [[S-II]], and S-IVB, to achieve Earth orbit. The launch phase experienced only three minor problems: The engines of the first stage, S-IC, underperformed by 0.75%, causing the engines to burn for 2.45&amp;nbsp;seconds longer than planned, and toward the end of the second stage burn, S-II, the rocket underwent [[pogo oscillation]]s. Frank Borman estimated{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} the oscillations were approximately {{nowrap|12 [[hertz]]}} and {{nowrap|±0.25 ''[[g-force|g]]''}} (±2.5&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name=&quot;orloff1&quot; /&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2014}}

All three rocket stages fired during launch; the S-IC and S-II detached during launch.&lt;ref name=&quot;chariots11-6&quot; /&gt; The S-IC impacted the [[Atlantic Ocean]] at {{Coord|30|12|N|74|7|W|name=Apollo 8 S-IC impact}} and the S-II second stage at {{Coord|31|50|N|37|17|W|name=Apollo 8 S-II impact}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;zimmerman1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;orloff1&quot; /&gt; The third stage of the rocket, S-IVB, assisted in driving the craft into Earth orbit but remained attached to later perform the TLI burn that would put the spacecraft on a trajectory to the Moon.

Once in Earth orbit, both the Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 crew and [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control]] spent the next 2&amp;nbsp;hours and 38&amp;nbsp;minutes checking that the spacecraft was in proper working order and ready for TLI. The proper operation of third stage of the rocket, S-IVB, was crucial: in the last unmanned test, the S-IVB had failed to re-ignite for TLI.&lt;ref name=&quot;chariots11-6&quot; /&gt;

During the flight, three fellow astronauts served on the ground as [[Flight controller#Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM)|Capsule Communicator]]s (usually referred to as &quot;CAPCOMs&quot;) on a rotating schedule. The CAPCOMs were the only people who regularly communicated with the crew.

Over the next 12&amp;nbsp;minutes before the TLI burn, the Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 crew continued to monitor the spacecraft and the S-IVB. The engine ignited on time and performed the TLI burn perfectly.

After the S-IVB had performed its required tasks, it was jettisoned. The crew then rotated the spacecraft to take some photographs of the spent stage and then practiced flying in formation with it. As the crew rotated the spacecraft, they had their first views of the Earth as they moved away from it. This marked the first time humans could view the whole Earth at once.&lt;ref name=&quot;chariots11-6&quot; /&gt; Borman became worried that the S-IVB was staying too close to the Command/Service Module and suggested to Mission Control that the crew perform a separation maneuver. Mission Control first suggested pointing the spacecraft towards Earth and using the [[Apollo CSM#Reaction Control System|Reaction Control System]] (RCS) thrusters on the [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Service Module (SM)|Service Module]] (SM) to add {{convert|3|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} away from the Earth, but Borman did not want to lose sight of the S-IVB. After discussion, the crew and Mission Control decided to burn in this direction, but at {{convert|9|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;orloff1&quot; /&gt; These discussions put the crew an hour behind their flight plan.&lt;ref name=&quot;chariots11-6&quot; /&gt;

Five&amp;nbsp;hours after launch, Mission Control sent a command to the S-IVB booster to vent its remaining fuel through its engine bell to change the booster's trajectory. This S-IVB would then pass the Moon and enter into a solar orbit, posing no further hazard to Apollo&amp;nbsp;8. The S-IVB subsequently went into a {{convert|0.99|by|0.92|AU|Gm|lk=on|adj=on}} solar orbit with an [[inclination]] of 23.47° from the [[Ecliptic|plane of the ecliptic]], and an orbital period of 340.80&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;ref name=&quot;orloff1&quot; /&gt;

The Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 crew were the first humans to pass through the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s, which extend up to {{convert|15000|mi|km}} from Earth. Scientists predicted that passing through the belts quickly at the spacecraft's high speed would cause a radiation dosage of no more than a chest [[X-ray]], or 1 [[Gray (unit)|milligray]] (during the course of a year, the average human receives a dose of 2&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;mGy). To record the actual radiation dosages, each crew member wore a Personal Radiation [[Dosimeter]] that transmitted data to Earth as well as three passive film dosimeters that showed the cumulative radiation experienced by the crew. By the end of the mission, the crew experienced an average radiation dose of 1.6 mGy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biomedical&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Bailey |first=J.

Jim Lovell's main job as Command Module Pilot was as [[flight officer|navigator]]. Although Mission Control performed all of the actual navigation calculations, it was necessary to have a crew member serving as navigator so that the crew could successfully return to Earth in case of communication loss with Mission Control. Lovell navigated by star sightings using a [[sextant]] built into the spacecraft, measuring the angle between a star and the Earth's (or the Moon's) [[horizon]]. This task proved to be difficult, as a large cloud of debris around the spacecraft formed by the venting S-IVB made it hard to distinguish the stars.

By seven&amp;nbsp;hours into the mission, the crew was about one hour and 40&amp;nbsp;minutes behind flight plan due to the issues of moving away from the S-IVB and Lovell's obscured star sightings. The crew now placed the spacecraft into Passive Thermal Control (PTC), also known as &quot;barbecue&quot; roll. PTC involved the spacecraft rotating about once per hour along its long axis to ensure even heat distribution across the surface of the spacecraft. In direct sunlight, the spacecraft could be heated to over {{convert|200|C|F|abbr=on}} while the parts in shadow would be {{convert|-100|C|F|abbr=on}}. These temperatures could cause the [[atmospheric reentry#Thermal protection systems|heat shield]] to crack or propellant lines to burst. As it was impossible to get a perfect roll, the spacecraft actually swept out a [[Conical surface|cone]] as it rotated. The crew had to make minor adjustments every half-hour as the cone pattern got larger and larger.&lt;ref name=&quot;journal day 1 Maroon&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.nasa.gov/ap08fj/04day1_maroon.htm |title=Day 1: Maroon Team |last1=Woods |first1=W.

The first mid-course correction came 11&amp;nbsp;hours into the flight. Testing on the ground had shown that the [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Service Propulsion System|Service Propulsion System]] (SPS) engine had a small chance of exploding when burned for long periods unless its [[combustion chamber]] was &quot;coated&quot; first. Burning the engine for a short period would accomplish coating. This first correction burn was only 2.4&amp;nbsp;seconds and added about {{convert|20.4|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} velocity [[Retrograde and prograde motion|prograde]] (in the direction of travel).&lt;ref name=&quot;orloff1&quot; /&gt; This change was less than the planned {{convert|24.8|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} due to a bubble of [[helium]] in the [[redox|oxidizer]] lines causing lower than expected fuel pressure. The crew had to use the small RCS thrusters to make up the shortfall. Two later planned mid-course corrections were canceled as the Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 trajectory was found to be perfect.&lt;ref name='journal day 1 Maroon' /&gt;

11&amp;nbsp;hours into the flight, the crew had been awake for over 16&amp;nbsp;hours. Before launch, NASA had decided that at least one crew member should be awake at all times to deal with any issues that might arise. Borman started the first sleep shift, but between the constant radio chatter and mechanical noises, he found sleep difficult.&lt;ref name='journal day 1 Maroon' /&gt;

[[File:As8-16-2583.jpg|thumb|Apollo 8 [[S-IVB]] rocket stage, shortly after separation]]

About an hour after starting his sleep shift, Borman requested clearance to take a [[Secobarbital|Seconal]] [[Barbiturate|sleeping pill]]. However, the pill had little effect. Borman eventually fell asleep but then awoke feeling ill. He vomited twice and had a bout of diarrhea that left the spacecraft full of small globules of vomit and feces that the crew cleaned up to the best of their ability. Borman initially decided that he did not want everyone to know about his medical problems, but Lovell and Anders wanted to inform Mission Control. The crew decided to use the Data Storage Equipment (DSE), which could tape voice recordings and telemetry and dump them to Mission Control at high speed. After recording a description of Borman's illness they requested that Mission Control check the recording, stating that they &quot;would like an evaluation of the voice comments.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;journal day 2 green&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.nasa.gov/ap08fj/06day2_green.htm |title=Day 2: Green Team |last1=Woods |first1=W.

The Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 crew and Mission Control medical personnel held a conference using an unoccupied second floor control room (there were two identical control rooms in Houston on the second and third floor, only one of which was used during a mission). The conference participants decided that there was little to worry about and that Borman's illness was either a [[Gastroenteritis|24-hour flu]], as Borman thought, or a reaction to the sleeping pill.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Collins|Collins 2001]], p. 306&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers now believe that he was suffering from [[space adaptation syndrome]], which affects about a third of astronauts during their first day in space as their [[Labyrinth (inner ear)|vestibular system]] adapts to [[weightlessness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Quine |first=Tony |date=April 2007|title=Addicted to space: An appreciation of Anousheh Ansari, Part II |journal= Spaceflight|volume=49 |issue=4 |page=144|issn=0038-6340 |publisher=[[British Interplanetary Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Space adaptation syndrome had not been an issue on previous spacecraft ([[Project Mercury|Mercury]] and [[Project Gemini|Gemini]]), as those astronauts were unable to move freely in the comparatively smaller cabins of those spacecraft. The increased cabin space in the Apollo Command Module afforded astronauts greater freedom of movement, contributing to symptoms of space sickness for Borman and, later, astronaut Russell Schweickart during [[Apollo 9]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/scripts/experiment/exper.aspx?exp_index=747 |title=The Effects of Long-Duration Space Flight on Eye, Head, and Trunk Coordination During Locomotion |last1=Kozlovskaya |first1=Inessa B |last2=Bloomberg |first2=Jacob J. |last3=Layne |first3=Charles S. |year=2004 |work=Life Sciences Data Archive |publisher=Lyndon B.

The cruise phase was a relatively uneventful part of the flight, except for the crew checking that the spacecraft was in working order and that they were on course. During this time, NASA scheduled a television broadcast at 31&amp;nbsp;hours after launch. The Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 crew used a 2&amp;nbsp;kg camera that broadcast in [[black-and-white]] only, using a [[Video camera tube|Vidicon]] tube. The camera had two [[lens (optics)|lenses]], a very [[wide-angle lens|wide-angle (160°) lens]], and a [[telephoto lens|telephoto (9°) lens]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chariots11-6&quot; /&gt;

During this first broadcast, the crew gave a tour of the spacecraft and attempted to show how the Earth appeared from space. However, difficulties aiming the narrow-angle lens without the aid of a monitor to show what it was looking at made showing the Earth impossible. Additionally, the Earth image became saturated by any bright source without proper [[Optical filter|filters]]. In the end, all the crew could show the people watching back on Earth was a bright blob. After broadcasting for 17&amp;nbsp;minutes, the rotation of the spacecraft took the [[high-gain antenna]] out of view of the receiving stations on Earth and they ended the transmission with Lovell wishing his mother a happy birthday.&lt;ref name=&quot;chariots11-6&quot; /&gt;

By this time, the crew had completely abandoned the planned sleep shifts. Lovell went to sleep 32½&amp;nbsp;hours into the flight—3½&amp;nbsp;hours before he had planned to. A short while later, Anders also went to sleep after taking a sleeping pill.&lt;ref name=&quot;chariots11-6&quot; /&gt;

The crew was unable to see the Moon for much of the outward cruise. Two factors made the Moon almost impossible to see from inside the spacecraft: three of the five windows fogging up due to out-gassed oils from the [[silicone]] [[sealant]], and the [[Orientation (geometry)|attitude]] required for the PTC. It was not until the crew had gone behind the Moon that they would be able to see it for the first time.&lt;ref name=&quot;zimmerman1&quot; /&gt;

The Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 made a second television broadcast at 55&amp;nbsp;hours into the flight. This time, the crew rigged up filters meant for the still cameras so they could acquire images of the Earth through the telephoto lens. Although difficult to aim, as they had to maneuver the entire spacecraft, the crew was able to broadcast back to Earth the first television pictures of the Earth. The crew spent the transmission describing the Earth and what was visible and the colors they could see. The transmission lasted 23&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;chariots11-6&quot; /&gt;

===Lunar sphere of influence===
At about 55&amp;nbsp;hours and 40&amp;nbsp;minutes into the flight, the crew of Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 became the first humans to enter the gravitational sphere of influence of another celestial body.&lt;ref name=&quot;orloff1&quot; /&gt; In other words, the effect of the Moon's [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|gravitational force]] on Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 became stronger than that of the Earth. At the time it happened, Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 was {{convert|38759|mi|km}} from the Moon and had a speed of {{convert|3990|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} relative to the Moon.&lt;ref name=&quot;orloff1&quot; /&gt; This historic moment was of little interest to the crew since they were still calculating their [[trajectory]] with respect to the launch pad at Kennedy Space Center. They would continue to do so until they performed their last mid-course correction, switching to a [[Frame of reference|reference frame]] based on ideal orientation for the second engine burn they would make in lunar orbit. It was only 13&amp;nbsp;hours until they would be in lunar orbit.&lt;ref name=&quot;lostmoon&quot;&gt;[[#Lovell &amp; Kluger|Lovell &amp; Kluger 1994]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The last major event before Lunar Orbit Insertion (LOI) was a second mid-course correction. It was in [[Retrograde and direct motion|retrograde]] (against direction of travel) and slowed the spacecraft down by {{convert|2.0|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}, effectively lowering the closest distance that the spacecraft would pass the moon.&lt;ref name=&quot;orloff1&quot; /&gt; At exactly 61&amp;nbsp;hours after launch, about {{convert|24200|mi|km}} from the Moon, the crew burned the RCS for 11&amp;nbsp;seconds. They would now pass {{convert|71.7|mi|km}} from the [[Geology of the Moon#Lunar landscape|lunar surface]].&lt;ref name=&quot;zimmerman1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;orloff1&quot; /&gt;

At 64&amp;nbsp;hours into the flight, the crew began to prepare for Lunar Orbit Insertion-1 (LOI-1). This maneuver had to be performed perfectly, and due to [[orbital mechanics]] had to be on the far side of the Moon, out of contact with the Earth. After Mission Control was polled for a &quot;[[Launch status check|go/no go]]&quot; decision, the crew was told at 68&amp;nbsp;hours, they were Go and &quot;riding the best bird we can find.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;journal day 3 LOI&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.nasa.gov/ap08fj/11day3_black_approach.htm |title=Day 3: The Black Team - Approaching the Moon |last1=Woods |first1=W.

With 10&amp;nbsp;minutes before the LOI-1, the crew began one last check of the spacecraft systems and made sure that every switch was in the correct place. At that time, they finally got their first glimpses of the Moon. They had been flying over the unlit side, and it was Lovell who saw the first shafts of sunlight [[wiktionary:oblique|oblique]]ly illuminating the lunar surface. The LOI burn was only two&amp;nbsp;minutes away, so the crew had little time to appreciate the view.&lt;ref name=&quot;lostmoon&quot; /&gt;

===Lunar orbit===
The SPS ignited at 69&amp;nbsp;hours, 8&amp;nbsp;minutes, and 16&amp;nbsp;seconds after launch and burned for 4&amp;nbsp;minutes and 13&amp;nbsp;seconds, placing the Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 spacecraft in orbit around the Moon. The crew described the burn as being the longest four minutes of their lives. If the burn had not lasted exactly the correct amount of time, the spacecraft could have ended up in a highly [[ellipse|elliptical]] lunar orbit or even flung off into space. If it lasted too long they could have struck the Moon. After making sure the spacecraft was working, they finally had a chance to look at the Moon, which they would orbit for the next 20&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;nssdc orbit&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1968-118A |title=Apollo 8 |work=[[National Space Science Data Center]] |publisher=NASA |accessdate=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Earth, Mission Control continued to wait. If the crew had not burned the engine or the burn had not lasted the planned length of time, the crew would appear early from behind the Moon. However, this time came and went without Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 reappearing. Exactly at the calculated moment, the signal was received from the spacecraft, indicating it was in a {{convert|193.3|by|69.5|mi|km|adj=on}} orbit about the Moon.&lt;ref name=&quot;nssdc orbit&quot; /&gt;

After reporting on the status of the spacecraft, Lovell gave the first description of what the lunar surface looked like:
{{quote|The Moon is essentially grey, no color; looks like [[plaster of Paris]] or sort of a grayish beach sand. We can see quite a bit of detail. The [[Mare Fecunditatis|Sea of Fertility]] doesn't stand out as well here as it does back on Earth. There's not as much contrast between that and the surrounding craters. The craters are all rounded off. There's quite a few of them, some of them are newer. Many of them look like—especially the round ones—look like hit by [[meteorite]]s or projectiles of some sort. [[Langrenus (crater)|Langrenus]] is quite a huge crater; it's got a central cone to it. The walls of the crater are terraced, about six or seven different [[wiktionary:terrace|terraces]] on the way down.&lt;ref name=&quot;journal day 4-123&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.nasa.gov/ap08fj/13day4_orbits123.htm |title=Day 4: Lunar Orbits 1, 2 and 3 |last1=Woods |first1=W.

[[File:The Lunar Farside - GPN-2000-001127.jpg|thumb|upright|A portion of the [[Far side of the Moon|lunar far side]] as seen from Apollo 8]]

Lovell continued to describe the terrain they were passing over. One of the crew's major tasks was [[reconnaissance]] of planned future landing sites on the Moon, especially one in [[Mare Tranquillitatis]] that would be the Apollo&amp;nbsp;11 landing site. The launch time of Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 had been chosen to give the best lighting conditions for examining the site. A [[film camera]] had been set up in one of the spacecraft windows to record a frame every second of the Moon below. Bill Anders spent much of the next 20&amp;nbsp;hours taking as many photographs as possible of targets of interest. By the end of the mission the crew had taken 700 photographs of the Moon and 150 of the Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;zimmerman1&quot; /&gt;

Throughout the hour that the spacecraft was in contact with Earth, Borman kept asking how the data for the SPS looked. He wanted to make sure that the engine was working and could be used to return early to the Earth if necessary. He also asked that they receive a &quot;go/no go&quot; decision before they passed behind the Moon on each orbit.&lt;ref name=&quot;journal day 4-123&quot; /&gt;

As they reappeared for their second pass in front of the Moon, the crew set up the equipment to broadcast a view of the lunar surface. Anders described the craters that they were passing over. At the end of this second orbit they performed the 11-second LOI-2 burn of the SPS to circularize the orbit to {{convert|70.0|by|71.3|mi|km}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;nssdc orbit&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;journal day 4-123&quot; /&gt;

Through the next two orbits, the crew continued to keep check of the spacecraft and to observe and photograph the Moon. During the third pass, Borman read a small prayer for his church. He had been scheduled to participate in a service at St. Christopher's [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] Church near [[Seabrook, Texas]], but due to the Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 flight was unable. A fellow parishioner and engineer at Mission Control, Rod Rose, suggested that Borman read the prayer which could be recorded and then replayed during the service.&lt;ref name=&quot;zimmerman1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;journal day 4-123&quot; /&gt;

In the foreword to the Millennial Edition of his novel ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' [[Arthur C. Clarke]] says that crew told him &quot;they had been tempted to radio back the discovery of a large black monolith,&quot; but discretion prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Clarke|Clarke 2000]], p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

====Earthrise====
{{main|Earthrise}}
When the spacecraft came out from behind the Moon for its fourth pass across the front, the crew witnessed &quot;Earthrise&quot; for the first time in human history (NASA's [[Lunar Orbiter 1]] took the very first picture of an Earthrise from the vicinity of the Moon, on August 23, 1966).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Poole|Poole 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt; Borman saw the Earth emerging from behind the lunar horizon and called in excitement to the others, taking a black-and-white photo as he did so. In the ensuing scramble Anders took the [[Earthrise|more famous color photo]], later picked by ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine as one of its hundred photos of the century.&lt;ref name=&quot;journal day 4-456&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.nasa.gov/ap08fj/14day4_orbits456.htm |title=Day 4: Lunar Orbits 4, 5 and 6 |last1=Woods |first1=W.

Earthrise is generally only visible when orbiting the Moon, other than at selected places near the Moon's [[lunar limb|limb]], where [[libration]] carries the Earth slightly above and below the lunar horizon.

Anders continued to take photographs while Lovell assumed control of the spacecraft so Borman could rest.&lt;ref name=&quot;journal day 4-456&quot;/&gt; Despite the difficulty resting in the cramped and noisy spacecraft, Borman was able to sleep for two orbits, awakening periodically to ask questions about their status.&lt;ref name=&quot;journal day 4-456&quot;/&gt; Borman awoke fully, however, when he started to hear his fellow crew members make mistakes. They were beginning to not understand questions and would have to ask for the answers to be repeated. Borman realized that everyone was extremely tired having not had a good night's sleep in over three days. Taking command, he ordered Anders and Lovell to get some sleep and that the rest of the flight plan regarding observing the Moon be scrubbed. At first Anders protested saying that he was fine, but Borman would not be swayed. At last Anders agreed as long as Borman would set up the camera to continue to take automatic shots of the Moon. Borman also remembered that there was a second television broadcast planned, and with so many people expected to be watching he wanted the crew to be alert. For the next two orbits Anders and Lovell slept while Borman sat at the helm. On subsequent Apollo missions, crews would avoid this situation by sleeping on the same schedule.
[[File:Apollo 8 genesis reading.ogg|left|thumb|The Apollo 8 Genesis reading.]]

As they rounded the Moon for the ninth time, the second television transmission began. Borman introduced the crew, followed by each man giving his impression of the lunar surface and what it was like to be orbiting the Moon. Borman described it as being &quot;a vast, lonely, forbidding expanse of nothing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#De Groot|De Groot 2006]], p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; Then, after talking about what they were flying over, Anders said that the crew had a message for all those on Earth. Each man on board [[Apollo 8 Genesis reading|read a section from the Biblical creation story]] from the Book of Genesis. Borman finished the broadcast by wishing a Merry Christmas to everyone on Earth. His message appeared to sum up the feelings that all three crewmen had from their vantage point in lunar orbit. Borman said, &quot;And from the crew of Apollo 8, we close with good night, good luck, a Merry Christmas and God bless all of you - all of you on the good Earth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;moonport&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Benson |first1=Charles D. |last2=Faherty |first2=William Barnaby |title=Moonport: A History of Apollo Launch Facilities and Operations |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4204/contents.html |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080123133438/http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4204/contents.html |archivedate=January 23, 2008 |accessdate=February 7, 2008 |year=1978 |publisher=NASA |id=NASA SP-4204 |chapter=Apollo 8 - A Christmas Gift |chapterurl=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4204/ch20-9.html |deadurl=no}} Ch.20-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The only task left for the crew at this point was to perform the [[Trans-Earth injection|Trans-Earth Injection]] (TEI), which was scheduled for 2½&amp;nbsp;hours after the end of the television transmission. The TEI was the most critical burn of the flight, as any failure of the SPS to ignite would strand the crew in lunar orbit, with little hope of escape. As with the previous burn, the crew had to perform the maneuver above the far side of the Moon, out of contact with Earth.

The burn occurred exactly on time. The spacecraft telemetry was reacquired as it re-emerged from behind the Moon at 89&amp;nbsp;hours, 28&amp;nbsp;minutes, and 39&amp;nbsp;seconds, the exact time calculated. When voice contact was regained, Lovell announced, &quot;Please be informed, there is a [[Santa Claus]],&quot; to which Ken Mattingly, the current CAPCOM, replied, &quot;That's affirmative, you are the best ones to know.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;journal day 4 TEI&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.nasa.gov/ap08fj/16day4_final_orbit_tei.htm |title=Day 4: Final Orbit and Trans-Earth Injection |last1=Woods |first1=W.

===Unplanned manual re-alignment===
Later, Lovell used some otherwise idle time to do some navigational sightings, maneuvering the module to view various stars by using the computer keyboard. However, he accidentally erased some of the computer's memory, which caused the [[Apollo PGNCS#Inertial Measurement Unit|Inertial Measurement Unit]] (IMU) to think the module was in the same relative position it had been in before lift-off and fire the thrusters to &quot;correct&quot; the module's attitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benke&quot; /&gt;

Once the crew realized why the computer had changed the module's attitude, they realized they would have to re-enter data that would tell the computer its real position. It took Lovell ten&amp;nbsp;minutes to figure out the right numbers, using the thrusters to get the stars [[Rigel]] and [[Sirius]] aligned, and another 15&amp;nbsp;minutes to enter the corrected data into the computer.&lt;ref name=&quot;lostmoon&quot; /&gt;

16 months later, Lovell would once again have to perform a similar manual re-alignment, under more critical conditions, during the [[Apollo 13]] mission, after that module's IMU had to be turned off to conserve energy. In his 1994 book, ''[[Lost Moon|Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13]]'', Lovell wrote, &quot;My training &amp;#91;on Apollo 8&amp;#93; came in handy!&quot; In that book he dismissed the incident as a &quot;planned experiment,&quot; requested by the ground crew.&lt;ref name=&quot;lostmoon&quot; /&gt; In subsequent interviews Lovell has acknowledged that the incident was an accident, caused by his mistake.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benke&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;zimmerman1&quot; /&gt;

===Cruise back to Earth and re-entry===
[[File:Apollo 8 reentry, December 27, 1968.jpg|thumb|upright|Reentry, December 27, 1968]]

The cruise back to Earth was mostly a time for the crew to relax and monitor the spacecraft. As long as the trajectory specialists had calculated everything correctly, the spacecraft would re-enter two-and-half days after TEI and [[splashdown (spacecraft landing)|splashdown]] in the Pacific.

On Christmas afternoon, the crew made their fifth television broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This time they gave a tour of the spacecraft, showing how an astronaut lived in space. When they finished broadcasting they found a small present from Deke Slayton in the food locker: a real turkey dinner with stuffing, in the same kind of pack that the troops in Vietnam received.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilford|Wilford 1973]], p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Another Slayton surprise was a gift of three [[Miniature (alcohol)|miniature bottles]] of [[brandy]], that Borman ordered the crew to leave alone until after they landed. They remained unopened, even years after the flight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unopened minis of brandy&quot;&gt;[[#Schefter|Schefter 1999]], p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; There were also small presents to the crew from their wives. The next day, at about 124&amp;nbsp;hours into the mission, the sixth and final TV transmission showed the mission's best video images of the earth, in a four-minute broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;

After two uneventful days the crew prepared for re-entry. The computer would control the re-entry and all the crew had to do was put the spacecraft in the correct attitude, blunt end forward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chaikin 127-128&quot;&gt;[[#Chaikin 1998|Chaikin 1998]], pp. 127–128&lt;/ref&gt; If the computer broke down, Borman would take over.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chaikin 127-128&quot; /&gt;

Once the Command Module was separated from the Service Module, the astronauts were committed to re-entry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chaikin 127-128&quot; /&gt; Six&amp;nbsp;minutes before they hit the top of the atmosphere, the crew saw the Moon rising above the Earth's horizon, just as had been predicted by the trajectory specialists.&lt;ref name=&quot;splashdown1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.nasa.gov/ap08fj/22day6_maroon_splash.htm |title=Day 6: The Maroon Team - Splashdown |last1=Woods |first1=W.

The spacecraft splashdown position was officially reported as {{Coord|8|8|N|165|1|W|name=Apollo 8 estimated splashdown}} in the North Pacific Ocean south of Hawaii.&lt;ref name=&quot;MissionReport&quot; /&gt;

When it hit the water, the parachutes dragged the spacecraft over and left it upside down, in what was termed Stable&amp;nbsp;2 position.&lt;ref name=&quot;orloff1&quot; /&gt; About six minutes later the Command Module was righted into its normal apex-up splashdown orientation by the inflatable bag uprighting system.&lt;ref name=&quot;orloff1&quot; /&gt; As they were buffeted by a {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=on}} swell, Borman was sick, waiting for the three flotation balloons to right the spacecraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;chariots11-6&quot; /&gt; It was 43&amp;nbsp;minutes after splashdown before the first [[frogman]] from the [[USS Yorktown (CV-10)|USS ''Yorktown'']] arrived, as the spacecraft had landed before sunrise.&lt;ref name=&quot;orloff1&quot; /&gt; Forty-five&amp;nbsp;minutes later, the crew was safe on the deck of the aircraft carrier.&lt;ref name=&quot;orloff1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;splashdown1&quot; /&gt;

==Historical importance==
Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 came at the end of 1968, a year that had seen much upheaval in the United States and most of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Men of the Year&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900486,00.html |title=Nation: Men of the Year |date=January 3, 1969 |work=Time |location=New York |accessdate=February 13, 2008| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080108120930/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900486,00.html |archivedate=January 8, 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the year saw political assassinations, political unrest in the streets of Europe and America, and the [[Prague Spring]], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine chose the crew of Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 as their [[Time Person of the Year|Men of the Year]] for 1968, recognizing them as the people who most influenced events in the preceding year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Men of the Year&quot;/&gt; They had been the first people ever to leave the gravitational influence of the Earth and orbit another celestial body.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apollo 8 Firsts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Apollo 8 Firsts|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/moon/peopleevents/e_firsts.html|work=American Experience: Race to the Moon|publisher=PBS|accessdate=December 15, 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/63xszRXVh|archivedate=December 15, 2011|location=Boston|date=September 22, 2005|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had survived a mission that even the crew themselves had rated as only having a fifty-fifty chance of fully succeeding. The effect of Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 can be summed up by a telegram from a stranger, received by Borman after the mission, that simply stated, &quot;Thank you Apollo&amp;nbsp;8. You saved 1968.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Chaikin|Chaikin 1994]], p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most famous aspects of the flight was the [[Earthrise]] picture that was taken as they came around for their fourth orbit of the Moon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poole 2008, pp. 8, 32&quot;&gt;[[#Poole|Poole 2008]], pp. 8, 32&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time that humans had taken such a picture whilst actually behind the camera, and it has been credited with a role in inspiring the first [[Earth Day]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Technology Innovation | url=http://ipp.nasa.gov/innovation/Innovation_84/wnewview.html | title=New Views for A New Century | last=Peggy | first=Wilhide | date=July/August 2000 | volume=8 | issue=4 | publisher=NASA Innovative Partnerships Program |accessdate=November 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was selected as the first of ''Life'' magazine's ''100 Photographs That Changed the World''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Life100&quot;&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Sullivan |editor-first=Robert |title=[[100 Photographs that Changed the World|100 Photographs That Changed the World]] |year=2003 |publisher=Time Inc.

The mission was the most widely covered by the media since the first American orbital flight, [[Mercury-Atlas 6]] by [[John Glenn]] in 1962. There were 1200 journalists covering the mission, with the [[BBC]] coverage being broadcast in 54 countries in 15 different languages. The Soviet newspaper ''[[Pravda]]'' featured a quote from Boris Nikolaevich Petrov, Chairman of the Soviet [[Interkosmos]] program, who described the flight as an &quot;outstanding achievement of American space sciences and technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pravda&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Boris Nikolaevich |last=Petrov |title=O polete Apollona-8 |newspaper=[[Pravda]] |publisher=[[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] |location=Moscow, USSR |date=December 30, 1968 |language={{ru icon}} |trans_title=On the flight of Apollo-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that a quarter of the people alive at the time saw—either live or delayed—the Christmas Eve transmission during the ninth orbit of the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Chaikin|Chaikin 1994]], 120&lt;/ref&gt; The Apollo 8 broadcasts won an [[Emmy Award]], the highest honor given by the [[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS Emmy Award&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Telecasts from Apollo 8|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/moon/peopleevents/e_telecasts.html|work=American Experience: Race to the Moon|publisher=PBS|accessdate=December 15, 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/63xrogvaG|archivedate=December 15, 2011 |location=Boston |date=September 22, 2005|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]], an [[Atheism|atheist]], later caused controversy by bringing a lawsuit against NASA over the reading from Genesis.&lt;ref name=&quot;prayer&quot;&gt;[[#Chaikin|Chaikin 1994]], p. 623&lt;/ref&gt; O'Hair wished the courts to ban American astronauts—who were all government employees—from public prayer in space.&lt;ref name=&quot;prayer&quot; /&gt; Though the case was rejected by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] for lack of jurisdiction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=397&amp;invol=531&amp;friend=nytimes|title=O'Hair v.

In 1969, the [[United States Postal Service]] issued a postage stamp ([[Scott catalogue]] #1371) commemorating the Apollo&amp;nbsp;8 flight around the Moon. The stamp featured a detail of the famous photograph of the [[Earthrise]] over the Moon taken by Anders on Christmas Eve, and the words, &quot;In the beginning God...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1847usa.com/ByYear/1969.htm |title=1969 U.S. Postage Stamp Issues |publisher=1847usa |accessdate=June 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just 18 days after the crew's return to Earth, they were featured during the [[Super Bowl III|1969 Super Bowl]] pre-game show reciting the [[Pledge of Allegiance]] prior to the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]] being performed by [[Anita Bryant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/history/entertainment | title=Super Bowl Entertainment | publisher=[[National Football League]] | accessdate=February 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''astronaut''' or '''cosmonaut''' is a person trained by a [[List of human spaceflight programs|human spaceflight program]] to command, pilot, or serve as a crew member of a [[spacecraft]]. 

While generally reserved for professional space travelers, the terms are sometimes applied to anyone who travels into space, including scientists, politicians, journalists, and tourists.

Starting in the 1950s up until 2002, astronauts were sponsored and trained exclusively by governments, either by the military or by civilian space agencies. With the sub-orbital flight of the privately funded [[SpaceShipOne]] in 2004, a new category of astronaut was created: the [[commercial astronaut]].

==Definition==
[[File:Alan Shepard in capsule aboard Freedom 7 before launch.jpg|thumb|[[Mercury-Redstone 3|Freedom 7]], a sub-orbital human space mission]]
The criteria for what constitutes [[human spaceflight]] vary. The [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] (FAI) Sporting Code for astronautics recognizes only flights that exceed an [[Edge of space|altitude of {{convert|100|km|mi|sp=us}}]].&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://www.fai.org/sporting_code/sc08_20012.pdf FAI Sporting Code, Section 8, Paragraph 2.12.1]&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, professional, military, and commercial astronauts who travel above an altitude of {{convert|50|mi|km}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/NewsReleases/2005/05-57.html NASA – X-15 Space Pioneers Now Honored as Astronauts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; are awarded [[Astronaut Badge|astronaut wings]].

{{As of|2013|June|8}}, a total of 532 people from [[Timeline of space travel by nationality|36 countries]] have reached {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} or more in altitude, of which 529 reached [[low Earth orbit]] or beyond.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBSQL&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/democurrent.html|title=Current Space Demographics|accessdate=September 27, 2009 |publisher=CBS News|year=2009|author=William Harwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;astr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/articles/womspace.htm|title=Women of Space |accessdate=October 4, 2007 |publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica|year=2007|author=Encyclopedia Astronautica| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071018022814/http://www.astronautix.com/articles/womspace.htm| archivedate= 18 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
{{See also|Astronaut ranks and positions}}

===English===
In English-speaking nations, a professional space traveler is called an ''astronaut''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thespacerace.com/glossary/index.php?term=54 TheSpaceRace.com – Glossary of Space Exploration Terminology&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The term derives from the Greek words ''ástron'' (ἄστρον), meaning &quot;star&quot;, and ''nautes'' (ναύτης), meaning &quot;sailor&quot;. The first known use of the term &quot;astronaut&quot; in the modern sense was by [[Neil R. Jones]] in his short story &quot;The Death's Head Meteor&quot; in 1930. The word itself had been known earlier. For example, in [[Percy Greg]]'s 1880 book ''Across the Zodiac'', &quot;astronaut&quot; referred to a spacecraft. In ''Les Navigateurs de l'Infini'' (1925) of [[J.-H. Rosny aîné]], the word ''astronautique'' (astronautic) was used. The word may have been inspired by &quot;aeronaut&quot;, an older term for an air traveler first applied (in 1784) to [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]]ists. An early use in a non-fiction publication is [[Eric Frank Russell]]'s poem &quot;The Astronaut&quot; in the November 1934 ''Bulletin of the [[British Interplanetary Society]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ingham, John L.: ''Into Your Tent'', Plantech (2010): page 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known formal use of the term [[astronautics]] in the scientific community was the establishment of the annual [[International Astronautical Congress]] in 1950 and the subsequent founding of the [[International Astronautical Federation]] the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAFpage&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = |first = | title = IAF History | publisher = [[International Astronautical Federation]] |author=IAF |date = 2010-08-16| url = http://www.iafastro.org/index.html?title=History| accessdate = 2010-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NASA]] applies the term astronaut to any crew member aboard NASA spacecraft bound for Earth orbit or beyond. NASA also uses the term as a title for those selected to join its [[NASA Astronaut Corps|Astronaut Corps]].&lt;ref name=&quot;biopage&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Dismukes |first = Kim – NASA Biography Page Curator | title = Astronaut Biographies | publisher = [[Johnson Space Center]], NASA |date = 2005-12-15| url = http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/| accessdate = 2007-03-06 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070307132816/http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/| archivedate= 7 March 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Space Agency similarly uses the term astronaut for members of its [[European Astronaut Corps|Astronaut Corps]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ESApage&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = |first = | title = The European Astronaut Corps | publisher = [[ESA]] |author=ESA |date = 2008-04-10| url = http://www.esa.int/esaHS/ESA75G0VMOC_astronauts_0.html| accessdate = 2008-12-28 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081220054618/http://www.esa.int/esaHS/ESA75G0VMOC_astronauts_0.html| archivedate= 20 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian===
{{Main|Soviet space program}}
By convention, an astronaut employed by the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] (or its [[Soviet space program|Soviet]] predecessor) is called a ''cosmonaut'' in English texts.&lt;ref name=&quot;biopage&quot;/&gt; The word is an [[anglicisation]] of the Russian word ''kosmonavt'' ({{lang-ru|космонавт}} {{IPA-ru|kəsmɐˈnaftʰ}}), one who works in space outside the Earth's atmosphere, a space traveler,&lt;ref name = &quot;space traveller&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Kotlyakov| first1 = Vladimir| last2 = Komarova| first2 = Anna| title = Elsevier's Dictionary of Geography: in English, Russian, French, Spanish and German| url = http://books.google.com/?id=6DhWw_cYLicC| year = 2006| publisher = Elsevier| isbn = 978-0-08-048878-3 | page = 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; which derives from the Greek words ''kosmos'' (κόσμος), meaning &quot;universe&quot;, and ''nautes'' (ναύτης), meaning &quot;sailor&quot;. Other countries of the former [[Eastern Bloc]] use variations of the Russian word ''kosmonavt'', such as the [[Poland|Polish]] ''kosmonauta''.

The [[Soviet Air Force]] pilot [[Yuri Gagarin]] was the first cosmonaut—indeed the first person—in space. [[Valentina Tereshkova]], a Russian factory worker, was the first woman in space, as well as arguably the second civilian to make it there (see [[#Civilian and non-government milestones|below]] for a further discussion of civilians in space). On March 14, 1995, [[Norman Thagard]] became the first American to ride to space on board a Russian launch vehicle, and thus became the first &quot;American cosmonaut&quot;.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Other terms===
With the rise of [[space tourism]], [[NASA]] and the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] agreed to use the term &quot;[[spaceflight participant]]&quot; to distinguish those space travelers from professional astronauts on missions coordinated by those two agencies.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

While no nation other than the Russian Federation (and previously the former Soviet Union), the United States, and China have launched a manned spacecraft, several other nations have sent people into space in cooperation with one of these countries. Inspired partly by these missions, other synonyms for astronaut have entered occasional English usage. For example, the term ''spationaut'' (French spelling: ''spationaute'') is sometimes used to describe French space travelers, from the [[Latin]] word ''spatium'' for &quot;space&quot;, the [[Malay language|Malay]] term ''angkasawan'' was used to describe participants in the [[Angkasawan program]], and the [[Indian Space Research Organization]] hope to launch a [[ISRO Orbital Vehicle|spacecraft]] in 2018 that would carry ''[[Indian human spaceflight programme#Terminology|vyomanauts]]'', coined from the [[Sanskrit]] word for space.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Duration and distance milestones===
The longest stay in space thus far has been 438 days, by Russian [[Valeri Polyakov]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot;/&gt;
As of 2006, the most spaceflights by an individual astronaut is seven, a record held by both [[Jerry L. Ross]] and [[Franklin Chang-Diaz]]. The farthest distance from Earth an astronaut has traveled was {{convert|401056|km|0|abbr=on}}, when [[Jim Lovell]], [[Jack Swigert]], and [[Fred Haise]] went around the Moon during the [[Apollo 13]] emergency.&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot;/&gt;

===Civilian and non-government milestones===
Depending on the exact definition of 'civilian', the first civilian in space was either [[Valentina Tereshkova]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Valentina Vladimirovna TERESHKOVA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adm.yar.ru/english/section.aspx?section_id=74|title=Valentina Vladimirovna TERESHKOVA}}&lt;/ref&gt; aboard [[Vostok 6]] (she also became the first woman in space on that mission) or [[Joseph Albert Walker]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Civilians in Space&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/fourmilog/archives/2006-08/000736.html|title=Civilians in Space}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Space.com Joseph A Walker&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/adastra/adastra_joewalker_061127.html|title=Space.com Joseph A Walker}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[X-15 Flight 90]] a month later. Tereshkova was only honorarily inducted into the USSR's Air Force, which had no female pilots whatsoever at that time. Joe Walker had joined the US Army Air Force but was not a member during his flight. The first people in space who had never been a member of any country's armed forces were both [[Konstantin Feoktistov]] and [[Boris Yegorov]] aboard [[Voskhod 1]].

The first non-governmental space traveler was [[Byron K.

Once selected, NASA astronauts go through twenty months of training in a variety of areas, including training for [[extra-vehicular activity]] in a facility such as NASA's [[Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fact&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;training&quot;/&gt; Astronauts-in-training may also experience short periods of [[weightlessness]] in aircraft called the &quot;[[vomit comet]]&quot;, the nickname given to a pair of modified [[KC-135]]s (retired in 2000 and 2004 respectively, and replaced in 2005 with a [[McDonnell Douglas C-9|C-9]]) which perform [[Parabola|parabolic]] flights.&lt;ref name=&quot;comet&quot;/&gt; Astronauts are also required to accumulate a number of flight hours in high-performance jet aircraft. This is mostly done in [[T-38 Talon|T-38 jet aircraft]] out of [[Ellington Field]], due to its proximity to the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Johnson Space Center]].  Ellington Field is also where the [[Shuttle Training Aircraft]] is maintained and developed, although most flights of the aircraft are done out of [[Edwards Air Force Base]].

Prominent among these is the [[Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity]] Study in which astronauts (including former ISS commanders [[Leroy Chiao]] and [[Gennady Padalka]]) perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts to diagnose and potentially treat hundreds of medical conditions in space. This study's techniques are now being applied to cover professional and Olympic sports injuries as well as ultrasound performed by non-expert operators in medical and high school students. It is anticipated that remote guided ultrasound will have application on Earth in emergency and rural care situations, where access to a trained physician is often rare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/ADUM.html NASA - Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Pilot Study of Comprehensive Ultrasound Education at the Wayne State University School of Medicine: http://www.jultrasoundmed.org/cgi/content/abstract/27/5/745&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evaluation of Shoulder Integrity in Space: First Report of Musculoskeletal US on the International Space Station: http://radiology.rsna.org/content/234/2/319.abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insignia==
In Russia, cosmonauts are awarded [[Pilot-Cosmonaut of the Russian Federation]] upon completion of their missions, often accompanied with the award of [[Hero of the Russian Federation]].  This follows the practice established in the Soviet Union.

At NASA, those who complete astronaut candidate training receive a silver [[Astronaut Badge#NASA Astronaut Pins|lapel pin]]. Once they have flown in space, they receive a gold pin. U.S. astronauts who also have active-duty military status receive a special qualification badge, known as the [[Astronaut Badge]], after participation on a spaceflight. The [[United States Air Force]] also presents an Astronaut Badge to its pilots who exceed {{convert|50|mi|km}} in altitude.

==Deaths==
{{Main|List of spaceflight-related accidents and incidents#Astronaut fatalities}}

Eighteen astronauts (fourteen men and four women) have lost their lives during four space flights. By nationality, thirteen were American (including one of Indian origin), four were Russian ([[Soviet Union]]), and one was Israeli.

Eleven people (all men) have lost their lives training for spaceflight: eight Americans and three Russians. Six of these were in crashes of training jet aircraft, one drowned during water recovery training, and four were due to fires in pure oxygen environments.

The [[Space Mirror Memorial]], which stands on the grounds of the [[John F. Kennedy Space Center]] Visitor Complex, commemorates the lives of the men and women who have died during spaceflight and during training in the space programs of the United States. In addition to twenty NASA career astronauts, the memorial includes the names of a [[U.S. Air Force]] [[X-15]] test pilot, a U.S. Air Force officer who died while training for a then-classified military space program, and a civilian [[spaceflight participant]].

'''''A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People From Being a Burthen to Their Parents or Country, and for Making Them Beneficial to the Publick&lt;!-- NOTE: This is the original spelling. Please do not modify it. Thank you. --&gt;''''',&lt;ref name=&quot;gutenberg&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1080/1080-h/1080-h.htm | title=A Modest Proposal, by Dr. Jonathan Swift | publisher=[[Project Gutenberg]] | date=27 July 2008 | accessdate=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; commonly referred to as '''''A Modest Proposal''''', is a [[Juvenalian satire|Juvenalian]] [[satire|satirical essay]] written and published anonymously by [[Jonathan Swift]] in 1729. Swift suggests that the impoverished Irish might ease their economic troubles by selling their children as food for rich gentlemen and ladies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/restaurants-and-bars/from-cradle-to-crock-pot-20101013-16imh.html | title=From cradle to crock pot | work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] | date=13 October 2010 | accessdate=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This satirical [[hyperbole]] mocks heartless attitudes towards the poor, as well as Irish policy in general.

In English writing, the phrase &quot;a modest proposal&quot; is now conventionally an allusion to this style of straight-faced satire.

==Details==
Swift goes to great lengths to support his argument, including a list of possible preparation styles for the children, and calculations showing the financial benefits of his suggestion. He uses methods of argument throughout his essay which lampoon the then-influential [[William Petty]] and the [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] popular among followers of [[Francis Bacon]]. These lampoons include [[appeal to authority|appealing to the authority]] of &quot;a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London&quot; and &quot;the famous [[George Psalmanazar|Psalmanazar]], a native of the island [[Taiwan|Formosa]]&quot; (who had already confessed to ''not'' being from Formosa in 1706). This essay is widely held to be one of the greatest examples of sustained [[irony]] in the history of the English language. Much of its shock value derives from the fact that the first portion of the essay describes the plight of starving beggars in Ireland, so that the reader is unprepared for the surprise of Swift's solution when he states, &quot;A young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether [[stew]]ed, [[roasting|roasted]], [[baking|baked]], or [[boiling|boiled]]; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a [[fricassee]], or a [[ragout]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gutenberg&quot; /&gt;

Readers unacquainted with its reputation as a satirical work often do not immediately realise that Swift was not seriously proposing [[cannibalism]] and [[infanticide]], nor would readers unfamiliar with the satires of [[Horace]] and [[Juvenal]] recognise that Swift's essay follows the rules and structure of [[Latin satire]]s.

The satirical element of the pamphlet is often only understood after the reader notes the allusions made by Swift to the attitudes of landlords, such as the following: &quot;I grant this food may be somewhat dear, and therefore very proper for Landlords, who as they have already devoured most of the Parents, seem to have the best Title to the Children.&quot; Swift extends the conceit to get in a few jibes at England’s mistreatment of Ireland, noting that &quot;For this kind of commodity will not bear exportation, and flesh being of too tender a consistence, to admit a long continuance in salt, although perhaps I could name a country, which would be glad to eat up our whole nation without it.&quot;

In the tradition of Roman satire, Swift introduces the reforms he is actually suggesting by [[paralipsis]]:
{{quote|Therefore let no man talk to me of other expedients: Of taxing our absentees at five shillings a pound: Of using neither clothes, nor household furniture, except what is of our own growth and manufacture: Of utterly rejecting the materials and instruments that promote foreign luxury: Of curing the expensiveness of pride, vanity, idleness, and gaming in our women: Of introducing a vein of parsimony, prudence and temperance: Of learning to love our country, wherein we differ even from [[Sami people|Laplanders]], and the [[Tupi people|inhabitants of Topinamboo]]: Of quitting our animosities and factions, nor acting any longer like the Jews, who were [[Zealot Temple Siege|murdering one another]] at the very moment [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|their city was taken]]: Of being a little cautious not to sell our country and consciences for nothing: Of teaching landlords to have at least one degree of mercy towards their tenants. Lastly, of putting a spirit of honesty, industry, and skill into our shop-keepers, who, if a resolution could now be taken to buy only our native goods, would immediately unite to cheat and exact upon us in the price, the measure, and the goodness, nor could ever yet be brought to make one fair proposal of just dealing, though often and earnestly invited to it.

Therefore I repeat, let no man talk to me of these and the like expedients, 'till he hath at least some glympse of hope, that there will ever be some hearty and sincere attempt to put them into practice.}}

==Population solutions==
George Wittkowsky argued that Swift’s main target in ''A Modest Proposal'' was not the conditions in Ireland, but rather the can-do spirit of the times that led people to devise a number of illogical schemes that would purportedly solve social and economic ills.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wittkowsky_p76&quot;&gt;Wittkowsky, ''Swift’s Modest Proposal'', p76&lt;/ref&gt; Swift was especially insulted by projects that tried to fix population and labour issues with a simple cure-all solution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wittkowsky_p85&quot;&gt;Wittkowsky, ''Swift’s Modest Proposal'', p85&lt;/ref&gt; A memorable example of these sorts of schemes &quot;involved the idea of running the poor through a [[joint-stock company]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wittkowsky_p85&quot;/&gt; In response, Swift's ''Modest Proposal'' was &quot;a burlesque of projects concerning the poor&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wittkowsk_p88&quot;&gt;Wittkowsky, ''Swift's Modest Proposal'', p88&lt;/ref&gt; that were in vogue during the early 18th century.

''A Modest Proposal'' also targets the calculating way people perceived the poor in designing their projects. The pamphlet targets reformers who &quot;regard people as commodities&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wittkowsky_p101&quot;&gt;Wittkowsky, ''Swift's Modest Proposal'', p101&lt;/ref&gt; In the piece, Swift adopts the &quot;technique of a political arithmetician&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wittkowsky_p95&quot;&gt;Wittkowsky, ''Swift's Modest Proposal'', p95&lt;/ref&gt; to show the utter ridiculousness of trying to prove any proposal with dispassionate statistics.

Critics differ about Swift's intentions in using this faux-mathematical philosophy. Edmund Wilson argues that statistically &quot;the logic of the 'Modest proposal' can be compared with defense of crime (arrogated to Marx) in which he argues that crime takes care of the superfluous population&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wittkowsky_p95&quot;/&gt; Wittkowsky counters that Swift's satiric use of statistical analysis is an effort to enhance his satire that &quot;springs from a spirit of bitter mockery, not from the delight in calculations for their own sake&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wittkowsky_p98&quot;&gt;Wittkowsky, ''Swift's Modest Proposal'', p98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetoric==
Charles K. Smith argues that Swift's rhetorical style persuades the reader to detest the speaker and pity the Irish. Swift's specific strategy is twofold, using a &quot;trap&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith_p135&quot;&gt;Smith, ''Toward a Participatory Rhetoric'', p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; to create sympathy for the Irish and a dislike of the narrator who, in the span of one sentence, &quot;details vividly and with rhetorical emphasis the grinding poverty&quot; but feels emotion solely for members of his own class.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith_p136&quot;&gt;Smith, ''Toward a Participatory Rhetoric'', p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; Swift's use of gripping details of poverty and his narrator's cool approach towards them create &quot;two opposing points of view&quot; that &quot;alienate the reader, perhaps unconsciously, from a narrator who can view with 'melancholy' detachment a subject that Swift has directed us, rhetorically, to see in a much less detached way.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith_p136&quot;/&gt;

Swift has his proposer further degrade the Irish by using language ordinarily reserved for animals. Lewis argues that the speaker uses &quot;the vocabulary of animal husbandry&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith_p138&quot;&gt;Smith, ''Toward a Participatory Rhetoric'', p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the Irish. Once the children have been commodified, Swift's rhetoric can easily turn &quot;people into animals, then meat, and from meat, logically, into tonnage worth a price per pound&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith_p138&quot;/&gt;

Swift uses the proposer's serious tone to highlight the absurdity of his proposal. In making his argument, the speaker uses the conventional, text book approved order of argument from Swift's time (which was derived from the Latin rhetorician [[Quintilian]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith_p139&quot;&gt;Smith, ''Toward a Participatory Rhetoric'', p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; The contrast between the &quot;careful control against the almost inconceivable perversion of his scheme&quot; and &quot;the ridiculousness of the proposal&quot; create a situation in which the reader has &quot;to consider just what perverted values and assumptions would allow such a diligent, thoughtful, and conventional man to propose so perverse a plan&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith_p139&quot;/&gt;

==Influences==
There has been some scholarship about what other writings influenced Swift to write ''A Modest Proposal''.

===Tertullian's ''Apology''===
James Johnson argued that ''A Modest Proposal'' was largely influenced and inspired by [[Tertullian]]’s ''[[Apologeticus|Apology]]'': a satirical attack against early Roman persecution of Christianity. James William Johnson believes that Swift saw major similarities between the two situations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson_p563&quot;&gt;Johnson, ''Tertullian and A Modest Proposal'', p563&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson notes Swift's obvious affinity for Tertullian and the bold stylistic and structural similarities between the works ''A Modest Proposal'' and ''Apology''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson_p562&quot;&gt;Johnson, ''Tertullian and A Modest Proposal'', p562&lt;/ref&gt; In structure, Johnson points out the same central theme, that of cannibalism and the eating of babies as well as the same final argument, that &quot;human depravity is such that men will attempt to justify their own cruelty by accusing their victims of being lower than human.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson_p563&quot;/&gt; Stylistically, Swift and Tertullian share the same command of sarcasm and language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson_p563&quot;/&gt; In agreement with Johnson, Donald C. Baker points out the similarity between both authors' tones and use of irony. Baker notes the uncanny way that both authors imply an ironic &quot;justification by ownership&quot; over the subject of sacrificing children—Tertullian while attacking pagan parents, and Swift while attacking the English mistreatment of the Irish poor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker_p219&quot;&gt;Baker, ''Tertullian and Swift's A Modest Proposal'', p219&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defoe's ''The Generous Projector''===
It has also been argued that ''A Modest Proposal'' was, at least in part, a response to the 1728 essay ''The Generous Projector or, A Friendly Proposal to Prevent Murder and Other Enormous Abuses, By Erecting an Hospital for Foundlings and Bastard Children'' by Swift's rival [[Daniel Defoe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.montrealmirror.com/2009/021909/books1.html | title=A modest but failed proposal | work=[[Montreal Mirror]] | date=19 February 2009 | accessdate=10 January 2012 | last=Waters | first=Juliet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic themes==
Robert Phiddian's article &quot;Have you eaten yet? The Reader in A Modest Proposal&quot; focuses on two aspects of ''A Modest Proposal'': the voice of Swift and the voice of the Proposer. Phiddian stresses that a reader of the pamphlet must learn to distinguish between the satiric voice of Jonathan Swift and the apparent economic projections of the Proposer. He reminds readers that &quot;there is a gap between the narrator's meaning and the text's, and that a moral-political argument is being carried out by means of parody&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phiddian_p6&quot;&gt;Phiddian, ''Have You Eaten Yet?'', p6&lt;/ref&gt;

While Swift's proposal is obviously not a serious economic proposal, George Wittkowsky, author of &quot;Swift's Modest Proposal: The Biography of an Early Georgian Pamphlet&quot;, argues that to understand the piece fully, it is important to understand the economics of Swift’s time. Wittowsky argues that not enough critics have taken the time to focus directly on the mercantilism and theories of labour in 18th century England. &quot;[I]f one regards the ''Modest Proposal'' simply as a criticism of condition, about all one can say is that conditions were bad and that Swift's irony brilliantly underscored this fact&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phiddian_p3&quot;&gt;Phiddian, ''Have You Eaten Yet?'', p3&lt;/ref&gt;

===&quot;People are the riches of a nation&quot;===

At the start of a new industrial age in the 18th century, it was believed that &quot;people are the riches of the nation&quot;, and there was a general faith in an economy that paid its workers low wages because high wages meant workers would work less.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phiddian_p4&quot;&gt;Phiddian, ''Have You Eaten Yet?'', p4&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, &quot;in the mercantilist view no child was too young to go into industry&quot;. In those times, the &quot;somewhat more humane attitudes of an earlier day had all but disappeared and the laborer had come to be regarded as a commodity&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phiddian_p6&quot;/&gt;

Louis A. Landa presents Swift's ''A Modest Proposal'' as a critique of the popular and unjustified maxim of mercantilism in the 18th century that &quot;people are the riches of a nation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landa_p161&quot;&gt;Landa, ''A Modest Proposal and Populousness'', p161&lt;/ref&gt; Swift presents the dire state of Ireland and shows that mere population itself, in Ireland's case, did not always mean greater wealth and economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landa_p165&quot;&gt;Landa, ''A Modest Proposal and Populousness'', p165&lt;/ref&gt; The uncontrolled maxim fails to take into account that a person who does not produce in an economic or political way makes a country poorer, not richer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landa_p165&quot;/&gt; Swift also recognises the implications of such a fact in making mercantilist philosophy a paradox: the wealth of a country is based on the poverty of the majority of its citizens.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landa_p165&quot;/&gt; Swift however, Landa argues, is not merely criticising economic maxims but also addressing the fact that England was denying Irish citizens their natural rights and dehumanising them by viewing them as a mere commodity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landa_p165&quot;/&gt;

==Modern usage==
''A Modest Proposal'' is included in many literature programs as an example of [[Satire#Early modern western satire|early modern western satire]]. It also serves as an exceptional introduction to the concept and use of argumentative language, lending itself well to secondary and post-secondary essay courses. Outside of the realm of English studies, ''A Modest Proposal'' is a relevant piece included in many comparative and global literature and history courses, as well as those of numerous other disciplines in the arts, humanities, and even the social sciences.

The essay has been emulated many times. In his book ''A Modest Proposal'' (1984), evangelical author [[Frank Schaeffer]] emulated Swift's work in social conservative polemic against abortion and [[euthanasia]] in a future [[dystopia]] that advocated [[recycling]] of aborted [[embryos]] and [[fetuses]], as well as some [[disabled]] infants with compound intellectual, physical and physiological difficulties. (Such [[Baby Doe Rules]] cases were then a major concern of the [[pro-life]] movement of the early 1980s, which viewed selective treatment of those infants as [[disability discrimination]].) In his book ''A Modest Proposal for America'' (2013), statistician [[Howard Friedman]] opens with a satirical reflection of the extreme drive to fiscal stability by ultra-conservatives.

[[Hunter S. Thompson]]'s ''[[Fear and Loathing in America|Fear and Loathing in America: The Brutal Odyssey of an Outlaw Journalist]]'', which contains hundreds of private letters written by Thompson over the years, contains a letter in which he uses ''A Modest Proposal'''s satire technique against the [[Vietnam War]]. Thompson writes a letter to a local [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]] newspaper informing them that, on Christmas Eve, he was going to use [[napalm]] to burn a number of dogs and hopefully any humans they find. This letter protests the burning of Vietnamese people occurring overseas.

[[Kurt Cobain]] includes the lyric &quot;Sell the kids for food&quot; in his 1991 song, &quot;[[In Bloom]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://fredericksburg.com/News/FLS/2003/112003/11062003/1158483 | title = Features:It | publisher = [[The Free Lance–Star]] | date = 6 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All the discovered alkali metals occur in nature: in order of [[abundance of the chemical elements|abundance]], sodium is the most abundant, followed by potassium, lithium, rubidium, caesium, and finally francium, which is very rare due to its extremely high [[radioactivity]] and thus occurs only in [[trace radioisotope|traces]] due to its presence in natural [[decay chain]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;webelements-occurrence&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chemeducator&quot;/&gt; Experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of [[ununennium]] (Uue), which is likely to be the next member of the group, but they have all met with failure.&lt;ref name=&quot;link&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Search for superheavy elements using &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca + &lt;sup&gt;254&lt;/sup&gt;Es&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt; reaction|first1=R.W. |last1=Lougheed |first2=J.H.|last2=Landrum|first3=E.K.|last3=Hulet|first4=J.F.|last4=Wild|first5=R.J.|last5=Dougan|first6=A.D.|last6=Dougan|first7=H.|last7=Gäggeler|first8=M|last8=Schädel|first9=K.J.|last9=Moody|first10=K.E.|last10=Gregorich|last11=Seaborg|journal=Physical Review C|year=1985|pages=1760–1763|volume=32|issue=5|bibcode = 1985PhRvC..32.1760L|doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.32.1760|first11=G. }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ununennium may not be an alkali metal due to [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]], which are predicted to have a large influence on the chemical properties of [[superheavy element]]s;&lt;ref name=&quot;tanm&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lch.web.psi.ch/files/lectures/TexasA&amp;M/TexasA&amp;M.pdf |title=Gas Phase Chemistry of Superheavy Elements |author=Gäggeler, Heinz W. |date=5–7 November 2007 |work=Lecture Course Texas A&amp;M |accessdate=26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; even if it does turn out to be an alkali metal, it is predicted to have some differences in physical and chemical properties from its lighter homologues.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1729–1733}}

Most alkali metals have many different applications. Two of the most well-known applications of the pure elements are rubidium and caesium [[atomic clock]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;atomic-clocks&quot;/&gt; of which caesium atomic clocks are the most accurate and precise representation of time.&lt;ref name=&quot;pubs.usgs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nist-second&quot;/&gt; A common application of the compounds of sodium is the [[sodium-vapour lamp]], which emits very efficient light.&lt;ref name=&quot;lamp1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lamp2&quot;/&gt; [[Table salt]], or sodium chloride, has been used since antiquity. Sodium and potassium are also [[essential element]]s, having major biological roles as [[electrolyte]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;webelements-potassium&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;webelements-sodium&quot;/&gt; and although the other alkali metals are not essential, they also have various effects on the body, both beneficial and harmful.&lt;ref name=&quot;webelements-lithium&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;webelements-rubidium&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;webelements-caesium&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc-francium&quot;/&gt;

Most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first five members of the group. The chemistry of francium is not well established due to its extreme [[radioactive decay|radioactivity]];&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot; /&gt; thus, the presentation of its properties here is limited.

[[File:Cesium water.theora.ogv|thumb|Caesium reacts explosively with water even at low temperatures]]
All the alkali metals are highly reactive and are never found in elemental forms in nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;krebs&quot; /&gt; Because of this, they are usually stored in [[mineral oil]] or [[kerosene]] (paraffin oil).&lt;ref name=&quot;OU&quot;/&gt; They react aggressively with the [[halogen]]s to form the [[alkali metal halide]]s, which are white [[ionic crystal|ionic crystalline compounds]] that are all [[solubility|soluble]] in water except [[lithium fluoride]] ([[lithium|Li]][[fluorine|F]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot;/&gt; The alkali metals also react with water to form strongly [[alkali]]ne [[hydroxide]]s and thus should be handled with great care. The heavier alkali metals react more vigorously than the lighter ones; for example, when dropped into water, caesium produces a larger explosion than potassium.&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;alkalibangs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pubs.usgs&quot; /&gt; The alkali metals have the lowest first [[ionization energy|ionisation energies]] in their respective periods of the [[periodic table]]&lt;ref name=&quot;RubberBible84th&quot;&gt;{{cite book | editor = Lide, D. R. | title = CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics | edition = 84th | location = Boca Raton, FL | publisher = CRC Press | year = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; because of their low [[effective nuclear charge]]&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot;/&gt; and the ability to attain a [[noble gas]] configuration by losing just one [[electron]]. The second ionisation energy of all of the alkali metals is very high&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RubberBible84th&quot; /&gt;&lt;!--the second ionisation energy for francium is not given in [[ionization energies of the elements (data page)]]--&gt; as it is in a full shell that is also closer to the nucleus;&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot;/&gt; thus, they almost always lose a single electron, forming cations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot;/&gt;{{rp|28}} The [[alkalide]]s are an exception: they are unstable compounds which contain alkali metals in a −1 oxidation state, which is very unusual as before the discovery of the alkalides, the alkali metals were not expected to be able to form [[anion]]s and were thought to be able to appear in [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] only as cations. The alkalide anions have filled [[s-orbital|s-subshells]], which gives them more stability and allows them to exist.

The chemistry of lithium shows several differences from that of the rest of the group as the small Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation [[chemical polarity|polarises]] [[anion]]s and gives its compounds a more [[covalent bond|covalent]] character.&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot; /&gt; Lithium and [[magnesium]] have a [[diagonal relationship]]:&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot; /&gt; because of this, lithium has some similarities to magnesium.

All the alkali metals react vigorously or explosively with cold water, producing an [[aqueous solution]] of the strongly [[base (chemistry)|basic]] alkali metal [[hydroxide]] and releasing hydrogen gas.&lt;ref name=&quot;alkaliwater&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/group1/reacth2o.html#top |title=Reaction of the Group 1 Elements with Water |author=Clark, Jim |year=2005 |work=chemguide |accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reaction becomes more vigorous going down the group: lithium reacts steadily with [[effervescence]], but sodium and potassium can ignite and rubidium and caesium sink in water and generate hydrogen gas so rapidly that shock waves form in the water that may shatter glass containers.&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot;/&gt; When an alkali metal is dropped into water, it produces an explosion, of which there are two separate stages. The metal reacts with the water first, breaking the hydrogen bonds in the water and producing [[hydrogen]] gas; this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali metals. Second, the heat generated by the first part of the reaction often ignites the hydrogen gas, causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air. This secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water, lake or other body of water, not the initial reaction of the metal with water (which tends to happen mostly under water).&lt;ref name=&quot;alkalibangs&quot;/&gt;

Lithium and sodium react with [[carbon]] to form [[acetylide]]s, Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which can also be obtained by reaction of the metal with [[acetylene]]. Potassium, rubidium, and caesium react with [[graphite]]; their atoms are [[intercalation (chemistry)|intercalated]] between the hexagonal graphite layers, forming [[graphite intercalation compound]]s of formulae MC&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; (dark grey, almost black), MC&lt;sub&gt;48&lt;/sub&gt; (dark grey, almost black), MC&lt;sub&gt;36&lt;/sub&gt; (blue), MC&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt; (steel blue), and MC&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; (bronze) (M = K, Rb, or Cs).

Lithium, the lightest of the alkali metals, is the only alkali metal which reacts with [[nitrogen]] at [[standard conditions]], and its [[nitride]] is the only stable alkali metal nitride. Nitrogen is an [[reactivity (chemistry)|unreactive]] gas because breaking the strong [[triple bond]] in the [[dinitrogen]] molecule (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) requires a lot of energy. The formation of an alkali metal nitride would consume the ionisation energy of the alkali metal (forming M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions), the energy required to break the triple bond in N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the formation of N&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; ions, and all the energy released from the formation of an alkali metal nitride is from the [[lattice energy]] of the alkali metal nitride. The lattice energy is maximised with small, highly charged ions; the alkali metals do not form highly charged ions, only forming ions with a charge of +1, so only lithium, the smallest alkali metal, can release enough lattice energy to make the reaction with nitrogen [[exothermic]], forming [[lithium nitride]]. The reactions of the other alkali metals with nitrogen would not release enough lattice energy and would thus be [[endothermic]], so they do not form nitrides at standard conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;alkalireact&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/group1/reacto2.html#top |title=Reaction of the Group 1 Elements with Oxygen and Chlorine |author=Clark, Jim |year=2005 |work=chemguide |accessdate=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Sodium nitride]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N) and [[potassium nitride]] (K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N), while existing, are extremely unstable, being prone to decomposing back into their constituent elements, and cannot be produced by reacting the elements with each other at standard conditions.)&lt;ref name=Jansen1&gt;{{cite journal|title=Synthesis and structure of Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N|author=Fischer, D., Jansen, M.|journal= Angew Chem|volume=41|issue=10|page=1755|year=2002|doi=10.1002/1521-3773(20020517)41:10&lt;1755::AID-ANIE1755&gt;3.0.CO;2-C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jansen2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Synthesis and structure of K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N|author=Fischer, D.; Cancarevic, Z.; Schön, J.

All the alkali metals react readily with [[phosphorus]] and [[arsenic]] to form phosphides and arsenides with the formula M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Pn (where M represents an alkali metal and Pn represents a [[pnictogen]]). This is due to the greater size of the P&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; and As&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; ions, so that less lattice energy needs to be released for the salts to form.&lt;ref name=generalchemistry/&gt; These are not the only phosphides and arsenides of the alkali metals: for example, potassium has nine different known phosphides, with formulae K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P, K&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, K&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, KP, K&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;, KP&lt;sub&gt;10.3&lt;/sub&gt;, and KP&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Schnering&quot;&gt;H.G.

All the alkali metals react vigorously with [[oxygen]] at standard conditions. They form various types of oxides, such as simple [[oxide]]s (containing the O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; ion), [[peroxide]]s (containing the {{chem|O|2|2-}} ion, where there is a [[single bond]] between the two oxygen atoms), [[superoxide]]s (containing the {{chem|O|2|-}} ion), and many others. Lithium burns in air to form [[lithium oxide]], but sodium reacts with oxygen to form a mixture of [[sodium oxide]] and [[sodium peroxide]]. Potassium forms a mixture of [[potassium peroxide]] and [[potassium superoxide]], while rubidium and caesium form the superoxide exclusively. Their reactivity increases going down the group: while lithium, sodium and potassium merely burn in air, rubidium and caesium are [[pyrophoric]] (spontaneously catch fire in air).&lt;ref name=&quot;alkalireact&quot;/&gt;

The smaller alkali metals tend to polarise the more complex anions (the peroxide and superoxide) due to their small size. This attracts the electrons in the more complex anions towards one of its constituent oxygen atoms, forming an oxide ion and an oxygen atom. This causes lithium to form the oxide exclusively on reaction with oxygen at room temperature. This effect becomes drastically weaker for the larger sodium and potassium, allowing them to form the less stable peroxides. Rubidium and caesium, at the bottom of the group, are so large that even the least stable superoxides can form. Because the superoxide releases the most energy when formed, the superoxide is preferentially formed for the larger alkali metals where the more complex anions are not polarised. (The oxides and peroxides for these alkali metals do exist, but do not form upon direct reaction of the metal with oxygen at standard conditions.)&lt;ref name=&quot;alkalireact&quot;/&gt; In addition, the small size of the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; ions contributes to their forming a stable ionic lattice structure. Under controlled conditions, however, all the alkali metals, with the exception of francium, are known to form their oxides, peroxides, and superoxides. The alkali metal peroxides and superoxides are powerful [[oxidizing agent]]s. [[Sodium peroxide]] and [[potassium superoxide]] react with [[carbon dioxide]] to form the alkali metal carbonate and oxygen gas, which allows them to be used in [[submarine]] air purifiers; the presence of [[water vapour]], naturally present in breath, makes the removal of carbon dioxide by potassium superoxide even more efficient.&lt;ref name=generalchemistry/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lindsay |first1=D.

Rubidium and caesium can form even more complicated oxides than the superoxides. Rubidium can form Rb&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O and Rb&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; upon oxidation in air, while caesium forms an immense variety of oxides, such as the [[ozonide]] CsO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi =10.1007/BF00845494|title =Synthesis of cesium ozonide through cesium superoxide|year =1963|last1 =Vol'nov|first1 =I.

The alkali metals can also react analogously with the heavier chalcogens ([[sulfur]], [[selenium]], [[tellurium]], and [[polonium]]), and all the alkali metal chalcogenides are known (with the exception of francium's).

=====Reaction with hydrogen and the halogens (alkali metal hydrides and halides)=====

The alkali metals are among the most [[electropositive]] elements on the periodic table and thus tend to [[ionic bond|bond ionically]] to the most [[electronegative]] elements on the periodic table, the [[halogen]]s, forming [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] known as the alkali metal halides. This includes [[sodium chloride]], otherwise known as common salt. The reactivity becomes higher from lithium to caesium and drops from [[fluorine]] to [[iodine]].

Alkali metal cations do not usually form [[coordination complex]]es with simple [[Lewis base]]s due to their low charge of just +1 and their relatively large size; thus the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion forms most complexes and the heavier alkali metal ions form less and less. In [[aqueous solution]], the alkali metal ions exist as octahedral hexahydrate complexes ([M(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), with the exception of the lithium ion, which due to its small size forms tetrahedral tetrahydrate complexes ([Li(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;); the alkali metals form these complexes because their ions are attracted by electrostatic forces of attraction to the polar water molecules. Because of this, [[anhydrous]] salts containing alkali metal cations are often used as [[desiccant]]s.&lt;ref name=generalchemistry/&gt; Alkali metals also readily form complexes with [[crown ether]]s (e.g. [[12-crown-4]] for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [[15-crown-5]] for Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and [[18-crown-6]] for K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[cryptand]]s due to electrostatic attraction.&lt;ref name=generalchemistry/&gt;

=====Ammonia solutions=====
Unlike most metals, the alkali metals dissolve slowly in liquid [[ammonia]], forming hydrogen gas and the [[metal amide#Alkali metal amides|alkali metal amide]] (MNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where M represents an alkali metal). The process may be speeded up by a [[catalyst]]. The amide salt is quite insoluble and readily precipitates out of solution, leaving intensely coloured ammonia solutions of the alkali metals. The colour is due to the presence of [[solvated electron]]s, which contribute to the high electrical conductivity of these solutions. At low concentrations (below 3 M), the solution is dark blue and has ten times the conductivity of aqueous [[sodium chloride]]; at higher concentrations (above 3 M), the solution is copper-coloured and has approximately the conductivity of liquid metals like [[mercury (element)|mercury]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=generalchemistry/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;c&amp;w&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Cotton  |first=F.A. |first2=G.|last2=Wilkinson |title=Advanced Inorganic Chemistry |year=1972 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons Inc |location= |isbn=0-471-17560-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the alkali metal amide salt and solvated electrons, such ammonia solutions also contain the alkali metal cation (M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), the neutral alkali metal atom (M), [[diatomic molecule|diatomic]] alkali metal molecules (M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and alkali metal anions (M&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). These are unstable and eventually become the more thermodynamically stable alkali metal amide and hydrogen gas. Solvated electrons are powerful [[reducing agent]]s and are often used in chemical synthesis.&lt;ref name=generalchemistry/&gt;

=====Organometallic chemistry=====
[[File:Methyllithium-tetramer-2-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|200px|Structure of the methyllithium tetramer, (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Li)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]
Being the smallest alkali metal, lithium forms the widest variety of and most stable [[organometallic compound]]s, which are bonded covalently. [[Organolithium reagent|Organolithium]] compounds are electrically non-conducting volatile solids or liquids that melt at low temperatures, and tend to form [[oligomer]]s with the structure (RLi)&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; where R is the organic group. As the electropositive nature of lithium puts most of the [[charge density]] of the bond on the carbon atom, effectively creating a [[carbanion]], organolithium compounds are extremely powerful [[base (chemistry)|base]]s and [[carbon nucleophile|nucleophile]]s. For use as bases, [[butyllithium]]s are often used and are commercially available. An example of an organolithium compound is [[methyllithium]] ((CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Li)&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;), which exists in tetrameric (''x'' = 4) and hexameric (''x'' = 6) forms.&lt;ref name=generalchemistry/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brown1957 &gt;{{ cite journal | author = Brown, T. L.; Rogers, M. T. | title = The Preparation and Properties of Crystalline Lithium Alkyls | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | year = 1957 | volume = 79 | issue = 8 | pages = 1859–1861 | doi = 10.1021/ja01565a024 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The application of [[organosodium chemistry|organosodium]] compounds in chemistry is limited in part due to competition from [[organolithium compound]]s, which are commercially available and exhibit more convenient reactivity. The principal organosodium compound of commercial importance is [[sodium cyclopentadienide]]. [[Sodium tetraphenylborate]] can also be classified as an organosodium compound since in the solid state sodium is bound to the aryl groups. Organometallic compounds of the higher alkali metals are even more reactive than organosodium compounds and of limited utility. A notable reagent is [[Schlosser's base]], a mixture of [[n-Butyllithium|''n''-butyllithium]] and [[potassium tert-butoxide|potassium ''tert''-butoxide]]. This reagent reacts with [[propene]] to form the compound [[allylpotassium]] (KCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). [[cis-2-butene|''cis''-2-Butene]] and [[trans-2-butene|''trans''-2-butene]] equilibrate when in contact with alkali metals. Whereas [[isomerization]] is fast with lithium and sodium, it is slow with the higher alkali metals. The higher alkali metals also favor the [[steric hindrance|sterically]] congested conformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Superbases for organic synthesis | author = Manfred Schlosser | journal = Pure and Appl.

The atomic radii of the alkali metals increase going down the group.&lt;ref name=&quot;chemguide&quot;/&gt; Because of the [[shielding effect]], when an atom has more than one [[electron shell]], each electron feels electric repulsion from the other electrons as well as electric attraction from the nucleus.&lt;ref name=shielding&gt;{{cite book|first=Theodore|last=L. Brown|first2=H. Eugene |last2=LeMay, Jr.|first3=Bruce E.|last3=Bursten|first4=Julia R. |last4=Burdge|year=2003|title=Chemistry: The Central Science|edition=8th|publisher=Pearson Education|location=US|isbn=0-13-061142-5|url=http://www.pearsoneducation.net/brown}}{{dead link|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the alkali metals, the [[valence electron|outermost electron]] only feels a net charge of +1, as some of the [[nuclear charge]] (which is equal to the [[atomic number]]) is cancelled by the inner electrons; the number of inner electrons of an alkali metal is always one less than the nuclear charge. Therefore, the only factor which affects the atomic radius of the alkali metals is the number of electron shells. Since this number increases down the group, the atomic radius must also increase down the group.&lt;ref name=&quot;chemguide&quot;/&gt;

The [[ionic radius|ionic radii]] of the alkali metals are much smaller than their atomic radii. This is because the outermost electron of the alkali metals is in a different [[electron shell]] than the inner electrons, and thus when it is removed the resulting atom has one fewer electron shell and is smaller. Additionally, the [[effective nuclear charge]] has increased, and thus the electrons are attracted more strongly towards the nucleus and the ionic radius decreases.&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot;/&gt;

The first ionisation energy of an [[chemical element|element]] or [[molecule]] is the energy required to move the most loosely held electron from one [[mole (unit)|mole]] of gaseous atoms of the element or molecules to form one mole of gaseous ions with [[electric charge]] +1. The factors affecting the first ionisation energy are the [[nuclear charge]], the amount of [[shielding effect|shielding]] by the inner electrons and the distance from the most loosely held electron from the nucleus, which is always an outer electron in [[main group element]]s. The first two factors change the effective nuclear charge the most loosely held electron feels. Since the outermost electron of alkali metals always feel the same effective nuclear charge (+1), the only factor which affects the first ionisation energy is the distance from the outermost electron to the nucleus. Since this distance increases down the group, the outermost electron feels less attraction from the nucleus and thus the first ionisation energy decreases.&lt;ref name=&quot;chemguide&quot;/&gt; (This trend is broken in francium due to the [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic]] stabilization and contraction of the 7s orbital, bringing francium's valence electron closer to the nucleus than would be expected from non-relativistic calculations. This makes francium's outermost electron feel more attraction from the nucleus, increasing its first ionisation energy slightly beyond that of caesium.)&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|1729}}&lt;!--Also explain why the alkali metals have the lowest ionization energies in their period.--&gt;

The second ionisation energy of the alkali metals is much higher than the first as the second-most loosely held electron is part of a fully filled [[electron shell]] and is thus difficult to remove.&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot;/&gt;

=====Reactivity=====
{{main|Reactivity (chemistry)}}
The reactivities of the alkali metals increase going down the group. This is the result of a combination of two factors: the first ionisation energies and [[atomisation energy|atomisation energies]] of the alkali metals. Because the first ionisation energy of the alkali metals decreases down the group, it is easier for the outermost electron to be removed from the atom and participate in [[chemical reaction]]s, thus increasing reactivity down the group. The atomisation energy measures the strength of the [[metallic bond]] of an element, which falls down the group as the atoms increase in [[atomic radius|radius]] and thus the metallic bond must increase in length, making the delocalised electrons further away from the attraction of the nuclei of the heavier alkali metals. Adding the atomisation and first ionisation energies gives a quantity closely related to (but not equal to) the [[activation energy]] of the reaction of an alkali metal with another substance. This quantity decreases going down the group, and so does the activation energy; thus, chemical reactions can occur faster and the reactivity increases down the group.&lt;ref name=&quot;alkaliwater&quot;/&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

Electronegativity is a [[chemical property]] that describes the tendency of an [[atom]] or a [[functional group]] to attract [[electron]]s (or [[electron density]]) towards itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;{{GoldBookRef|file=E01990|title=Electronegativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the bond between [[sodium]] and [[chlorine]] in [[sodium chloride]] were [[covalent bond|covalent]], the pair of shared electrons would be attracted to the chlorine because the effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons is +7 in chlorine but is only +1 in sodium. The electron pair is attracted so close to the chlorine atom that they are practically transferred to the chlorine atom (an [[ionic bond]]). However, if the sodium atom was replaced by a lithium atom, the electrons will not be attracted as close to the chlorine atom as before because the lithium atom is smaller, making the electron pair more strongly attracted to the closer effective nuclear charge from lithium. Hence, the larger alkali metal atoms (further down the group) will be less electronegative as the bonding pair is less strongly attracted towards them.&lt;ref name=&quot;chemguide&quot;/&gt;

Because of the higher electronegativity of lithium, some of its compounds have a more covalent character. For example, [[lithium iodide]] ([[lithium|Li]][[iodine|I]]) will dissolve in [[organic solvent]]s, a property of most covalent compounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;chemguide&quot;/&gt; [[Lithium fluoride]] (Li[[fluorine|F]]) is the only [[alkali halide]] that is not soluble in water,&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot;/&gt; and [[lithium hydroxide]] (Li[[hydroxide|OH]]) is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not [[deliquescent]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot;/&gt;

The melting point of a substance is the point where it changes [[states of matter|state]] from [[solid]] to [[liquid]] while the boiling point of a substance (in liquid state) is the point where the [[vapor pressure]] of the liquid equals the environmental pressure surrounding the liquid&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David.

The alkali metals all have the same [[crystal structure]] ([[body-centered cubic|body-centred cubic]])&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot;/&gt; and thus the only relevant factors are the number of atoms that can fit into a certain volume and the mass of one of the atoms, since density is defined as mass per unit volume. The first factor depends on the volume of the atom and thus the atomic radius, which increases going down the group; thus, the volume of an alkali metal atom increases going down the group. The mass of an alkali metal atom also increases going down the group. Thus, the trend for the densities of the alkali metals depends on their atomic weights and atomic radii; if figures for these two factors are known, the ratios between the densities of the alkali metals can then be calculated. The resultant trend is that the densities of the alkali metals increase down the table, with an exception at potassium. Due to having the lowest atomic weight of all the elements in their period and having the largest atomic radius for their periods, the alkali metals are the least dense metals in the periodic table.&lt;ref name=&quot;chemguide&quot;/&gt; Lithium, sodium, and potassium are the only three metals in the periodic table that are less dense than water.&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot;/&gt;

All the alkali metals have odd atomic numbers; hence, their isotopes must be either [[odd-odd nuclei|odd-odd]] (both proton and [[neutron number]] are odd) or [[odd-even nuclei|odd-even]] ([[proton number]] is odd, but neutron number is even). Odd-odd nuclei have even [[mass number]]s, while odd-even nuclei have odd mass numbers. Odd-odd [[primordial nuclide]]s are rare because most odd-odd nuclei are highly unstable with respect to [[beta decay]], because the decay products are even-even, and are therefore more strongly bound, due to [[Semi-empirical mass formula#Pairing term|nuclear pairing effects]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lide02&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Various authors|editor-last=Lide |editor-first=David R. | year=2002 | title=Handbook of Chemistry &amp; Physics | edition=88th | publisher=CRC | url=http://www.hbcpnetbase.com/ | accessdate=2008-05-23 | isbn=0-8493-0486-5 | oclc=179976746 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the great rarity of odd-odd nuclei, almost all the primordial isotopes of the alkali metals are odd-even (the exceptions being the light stable isotope lithium-6 and the long-lived [[radioisotope]] potassium-40). For a given odd mass number, there can be only a single [[beta-decay stable isobars|beta-stable nuclide]], since there is not a difference in binding energy between even-odd and odd-even comparable to that between even-even and odd-odd, leaving other nuclides of the same mass number ([[isobar (nuclide)|isobar]]s) free to [[beta decay]] toward the lowest-mass nuclide. An effect of the instability of an odd number of either type of nucleons is that odd-numbered elements, such as the alkali metals, tend to have fewer stable isotopes than even-numbered elements. Of the 26 [[monoisotopic element]]s that have only a single stable isotope, all but one have an odd atomic number and all but one also have an even number of neutrons. [[Beryllium]] is the single exception to both rules, due to its low atomic number.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lide02&quot;/&gt;

[[Caesium-137]], with a half-life of 30.17&amp;nbsp;years, is one of the two principal [[medium-lived fission product]]s, along with [[strontium-90]], which are responsible for most of the [[radioactivity]] of [[spent nuclear fuel]] after several years of cooling, up to several hundred years after use.

Although francium is the heaviest alkali metal that has been discovered, there has been some theoretical work predicting the physical and chemical characteristics of the hypothetical heavier alkali metals. Being the first [[period 8 element]], the undiscovered element [[ununennium]] (element 119) is predicted to be the next alkali metal after francium and behave much like their lighter [[Congener (chemistry)|congener]]s; however, it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkali metals in some properties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1729–1730}} Its chemistry is predicted to be closer to that of potassium&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; or rubidium&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1729–1730}} instead of caesium or francium. This is unusual as [[periodic trends]], ignoring relativistic effects would predict ununennium to be even more reactive than caesium and francium. This lowered [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]] is due to the relativistic stabilisation of ununennium's valence electron, increasing ununennium's first ionisation energy and decreasing the [[metallic radius|metallic]] and [[ionic radius|ionic radii]];&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt; this effect is already seen for francium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1729–1730}} This assumes that ununennium will behave chemically as an alkali metal, which, although likely, may not be true due to relativistic effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;tanm&quot;/&gt; The relativistic stabilisation of the 8s orbital also increases ununennium's [[electron affinity]] far beyond that of caesium and francium; indeed, ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher than all the alkali metals lighter than it. Relativistic effects also cause a very large drop in the [[polarisability]] of ununennium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1729–1730}} On the other hand, ununennium is predicted to continue the trend of melting points decreasing going down the group, being expected to have a melting point between 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 30&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1724}}

The stabilisation of ununennium's valence electron and thus the contraction of the 8s orbital cause its atomic radius to be lowered to 240&amp;nbsp;[[picometer|pm]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1729–1730}} very close to that of rubidium (247&amp;nbsp;pm),&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot;/&gt; so that the chemistry of ununennium in the +1 oxidation state should be more similar to the chemistry of rubidium than to that of francium. On the other hand, the ionic radius of the Uue&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion is predicted to be larger than that of Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, because the 7p orbitals are destabilised and are thus larger than the p-orbitals of the lower shells. Ununennium may also show the +3 [[oxidation state]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1729–1730}} which is not seen in any other alkali metal,&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot;/&gt;{{rp|28}} in addition to the +1 oxidation state that is characteristic of the other alkali metals and is also the main oxidation state of all the known alkali metals: this is because of the destabilisation and expansion of the 7p&lt;sub&gt;3/2&lt;/sub&gt; spinor, causing its outermost electrons to have a lower ionisation energy than what would otherwise be expected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot;/&gt;{{rp|28}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1729–1730}} Indeed, many ununennium compounds are expected to have a large [[covalent]] character, due to the involvement of the 7p&lt;sub&gt;3/2&lt;/sub&gt; electrons in the bonding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thayer&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Chemistry of heavier main group elements|last=Thayer|first=John S.|doi=10.1007/9781402099755_2|year=2010|pages=81, 84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a simple extrapolation of the periodic table would put element 169, unhexennium, under ununennium, Dirac-Fock calculations predict that the next alkali metal after ununennium may actually be element 165, unhexpentium, which is predicted to have the electron configuration [Uuo] 5g&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; 6f&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; 7d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; 8s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 8p&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 9s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1729–1730}}&lt;ref name=&quot;pyykko&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Pyykkö|first1=Pekka|title=A suggested periodic table up to Z ≤ 172, based on Dirac–Fock calculations on atoms and ions|journal=Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics|volume=13|issue=1|pages=161–8|year=2011|pmid=20967377|doi=10.1039/c0cp01575j|bibcode = 2011PCCP...13..161P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further calculations show that unhexpentium would follow the trend of increasing ionisation energy beyond caesium, having an ionisation energy comparable to that of sodium, and that it should also continue the trend of decreasing atomic radii beyond caesium, having an atomic radius comparable to that of potassium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1729–1730}} However, the 7d electrons of unhexpentium may also be able to participate in chemical reactions along with the 9s electron, possibly allowing oxidation states beyond +1 and perhaps even making unhexpentium behave more like a [[boron group]] element than an alkali metal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1732–1733}}

The probable properties of the alkali metals beyond unhexpentium have not been explored yet as of 2012. In periods 8 and above of the periodic table, relativistic and shell-structure effects become so strong that extrapolations from lighter congeners become completely inaccurate. In addition, the relativistic and shell-structure effects (which stabilise the s-orbitals and destabilise and expand the d-, f-, and g-orbitals of higher shells) have opposite effects, causing even larger difference between relativistic and non-relativistic calculations of the properties of elements with such high atomic numbers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1732–1733}} Due to the alkali and [[alkaline earth metal]]s both being [[s-block]] elements, these predictions for the trends and properties of ununennium and unhexpentium also mostly apply to the corresponding alkaline earth metals [[unbinilium]] (Ubn) and unhexhexium (Uhh).&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1729–1733}}

However, Perey noticed decay particles with an energy level below 80&amp;nbsp;keV. Perey thought this decay activity might have been caused by a previously unidentified decay product, one that was separated during purification, but emerged again out of the pure [[actinium]]-227. Various tests eliminated the possibility of the unknown element being [[thorium]], [[radium]], [[lead]], [[bismuth]], or [[thallium]]. The new product exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal (such as coprecipitating with caesium salts), which led Perey to believe that it was element 87, caused by the [[alpha decay]] of actinium-227.&lt;ref name=&quot;chemeducator&quot;&gt;Adloff, Jean-Pierre; Kaufman, George B.

It is highly unlikely&lt;ref name=&quot;link&quot; /&gt; that this reaction will be able to create any atoms of ununennium in the near future, given the extremely difficult task of making sufficient amounts of [[Isotopes of einsteinium|&lt;sup&gt;254&lt;/sup&gt;Es]], which is favoured for production of [[superheavy element|ultraheavy elements]] because of its large mass, relatively long half-life of 270 days, and availability in significant amounts of several micrograms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schadel|first1=M.|last2=Brüchle|first2=W.|last3=Brügger|first3=M.|last4=Gäggeler|first4=H.|last5=Moody|first5=K.|last6=Schardt|first6=D.|last7=Sümmerer|first7=K.|last8=Hulet|first8=E.|last9=Dougan|first9=A.|last10=Dougan|displayauthors=9 |title=Heavy isotope production by multinucleon transfer reactions with &lt;sup&gt;254&lt;/sup&gt;Es|journal=Journal of the Less Common Metals|volume=122|pages=411|year=1986|doi=10.1016/0022-5088(86)90435-2|first10=R.J.|last11=Landrum|first11=J.H.|last12=Lougheed|first12=R.W.|last13=Wild|first13=J.F.|last14=O'Kelley|first14=G.D.|last15=Hahn|first15=R.L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; to make a large enough target to increase the sensitivity of the experiment to the required level; einsteinium has not been found in nature and has only been produced in laboratories.

==Occurrence==

===In the Solar System===
[[File:SolarSystemAbundances.png|thumb|right|800px|Estimated abundances of the chemical elements in the Solar system. Hydrogen and helium are most common, from the [[Big Bang]]. The next three elements (lithium, [[beryllium]], and [[boron]]) are rare because they are poorly synthesized in the Big Bang and also in stars. The two general trends in the remaining stellar-produced elements are: (1) an alternation of abundance in elements as they have even or odd atomic numbers, and (2) a general decrease in abundance, as elements become heavier. Iron is especially common because it represents the minimum energy nuclide that can be made by fusion of helium in supernovae.&lt;ref name=lodders&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lodders | first1 = Katharina | year = 2003 | title = Solar System Abundances and Condensation Temperatures of the Elements | url = | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 591 | issue = 2| pages = 1220–1247 |bibcode = 2003ApJ...591.1220L |doi = 10.1086/375492 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Oddo-Harkins rule]] holds that elements with even atomic numbers are more common that those with odd atomic numbers, with the exception of hydrogen. This rule argues that elements with odd atomic numbers have one unpaired proton and are more likely to capture another, thus increasing their atomic number.  In elements with even atomic numbers, protons are paired, with each member of the pair offsetting the spin of the other, enhancing stability.&lt;ref name=oddo&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/zaac.19140870118 | title = Die Molekularstruktur der radioaktiven Atome | year = 1914 | last1 = Oddo | first1 = Giuseppe | journal = Zeitschrift für anorganische Chemie | volume = 87 | pages = 253}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=harkins&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja02250a002 | year = 1917 | last1 = Harkins | first1 = William D. | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 39 | issue = 5 | pages = 856 | title = The Evolution of the Elements and the Stability of Complex Atoms.

The heavier alkali metals are also less abundant than the lighter ones as the alkali metals from rubidium onward can only be synthesized in [[supernova]]e and not in [[stellar nucleosynthesis]]. Lithium is also much less abundant than sodium and potassium as it is poorly synthesized in both [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] and in stars: the Big Bang could only produce trace quantities of lithium, [[beryllium]] and [[boron]] due to the absence of a stable nucleus with 5 or 8 [[nucleon]]s, and stellar nucleosynthesis could only pass this bottleneck by the [[triple-alpha process]], fusing three helium nuclei to form [[carbon]], and skipping over those three elements.&lt;ref name=lodders/&gt;

===On Earth===
[[File:Spodumene-usa59abg.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Spodumene]], an important lithium mineral]]
The [[Earth]] formed from the same cloud of matter that formed the Sun, but the planets acquired different compositions during the [[formation and evolution of the solar system]]. In turn, the [[history of Earth|natural history of the Earth]] caused parts of this planet to have differing concentrations of the elements. The mass of the Earth is approximately 5.98{{e|24}}&amp;nbsp;kg. It is composed mostly of [[iron]] (32.1%), [[oxygen]] (30.1%), [[silicon]] (15.1%), [[magnesium]] (13.9%), [[sulfur]] (2.9%), [[nickel]] (1.8%), [[calcium]] (1.5%), and [[aluminium]] (1.4%); with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to [[mass segregation]], the core region is believed to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.&lt;ref name=pnas71_12_6973&gt;{{cite journal | author=Morgan, J.

The alkali metals, due to their high reactivity, do not occur naturally in pure form in nature. They are [[Goldschmidt classification|lithophiles]] and therefore remain close to the Earth's surface because they combine readily with [[oxygen]] and so associate strongly with [[silica]], forming relatively low-density minerals that do not sink down into the Earth's core. Potassium, rubidium and caesium are also [[incompatible element]]s due to their low [[ionic radius|ionic radii]].&lt;ref name=&quot;albarede&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Geochemistry: an introduction | url = http://books.google.de/books?id=doVGzreGq14C&amp;pg=PA17 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-521-89148-6 | first =Francis | last = Albarède }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of pure alkali metals is difficult due to their extreme reactivity with commonly used substances, such as water. The alkali metals are so reactive that they cannot be [[single displacement reaction|displaced]] by other elements and must be isolated through high-energy methods such as electrolysis.&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=generalchemistry/&gt;

Lithium salts have to be extracted from the water of [[mineral spring]]s, [[brine]] pools, and brine deposits.

From their [[silicate]] ores, all the alkali metals may be obtained the same way: [[sulfuric acid]] is first used to dissolve the desired alkali metal ion and [[aluminium]](III) ions from the ore (leaching), whereupon basic precipitation removes aluminium ions from the mixture by precipitating it as the [[aluminium hydroxide|hydroxide]]. The remaining insoluble alkali metal [[carbonate]] is then precipitated selectively; the salt is then dissolved in [[hydrochloric acid]]. The result is then left to evaporate and the alkali metal can then be isolated through [[electrolysis]].&lt;ref name=generalchemistry/&gt;

Lithium and sodium are typically isolated through electrolysis from their liquid chlorides, with [[calcium chloride]] typically added to lower the melting point of the mixture. The heavier alkali metals, however, is more typically isolated in a different way, where a reducing agent (typically sodium for potassium and [[magnesium]] or [[calcium]] for the heaviest alkali metals) is used to reduce the alkali metal chloride. The liquid or gaseous product (the alkali metal) then undergoes [[fractional distillation]] for purification.&lt;ref name=generalchemistry/&gt;

==Applications==

All of the discovered alkali metals excluding francium have many applications. Lithium is often used in [[lithium-ion battery|batteries]], and [[lithium oxide]] can help process silica. Lithium can also be used to make lubricating greases, air treatment, and aluminium production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=USGS |year=2011|title=Lithium|url= http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/lithium/mcs-2011-lithi.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2011|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''alphabet''' is a standard set of [[letter (alphabet)|letters]] (basic written [[symbols]] or [[graphemes]]) which is used to write one or more [[language]]s based on the general principle that the letters represent [[phoneme]]s (basic significant sounds) of the [[spoken language]]. This is in contrast to other types of [[writing system]]s, such as [[syllabary|syllabaries]] (in which each character represents a [[syllable]]) and [[logograph]]ies (in which each character represents a word, [[morpheme]], or semantic unit).

A '''true alphabet''' has letters for the [[vowel]]s of a language as well as the [[consonant]]s. The first &quot;true alphabet&quot; in this sense is believed to be the [[Greek alphabet]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Blackwell&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Coulmas|first=Florian|title=The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Writing Systems|year=1996|publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] |location=Oxford|isbn=0-631-21481-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Millard|1986|p=396}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a modified form of the [[Phoenician alphabet]]. In other types of alphabet either the vowels are not indicated at all, as was the case in the Phoenician alphabet (such systems are known as [[abjad]]s), or else the vowels are shown by [[diacritic]]s or modification of consonants, as in the [[devanagari]] used in India and Nepal (these systems are known as [[abugida]]s or alphasyllabaries).

There are dozens of alphabets in use today, the most popular being the [[Latin alphabet]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haarmann|2004|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which was derived from the Greek). Many languages use modified forms of the Latin alphabet, with additional letters formed using diacritical marks.  While most alphabets have letters composed of lines ([[linear writing]]), there are also [[non-linear writing|exceptions]] such as the alphabets used in [[Braille]], [[fingerspelling]], and [[Morse code]].

Alphabets are usually associated with a standard ordering of their letters. This makes them useful for purposes of [[collation]], specifically by allowing words to be sorted in [[alphabetical order]]. It also means that their letters can be used as an alternative method of &quot;numbering&quot; ordered items, in such contexts as [[numbered list]]s.

==Etymology==
The English word ''alphabet'' came into [[Middle English]] from the [[Late Latin]] word ''alphabetum'', which in turn originated in the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀλφάβητος (''alphabētos''), from ''[[alpha (letter)|alpha]]'' and ''[[beta (letter)|beta]],'' the first two letters of the [[Greek alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=alphabet&amp;query=alphabet/ Encyclopædia Britannica Online&amp;nbsp;– Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Alpha'' and ''beta'' in turn came from the first two letters of the [[Phoenician alphabet]], and originally meant ''ox'' and ''house'' respectively.

==History==
{{Main|History of the alphabet}}
[[File:Caslon-schriftmusterblatt.jpeg|thumb|300px|''A Specimen'' of [[typeset]] [[font]]s and [[language]]s, by [[William Caslon]], letter founder; from the 1728 ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]''.]]

===Middle Eastern scripts===
The history of the alphabet started in [[ancient Egypt]]. By the 27th century BC Egyptian writing had a set of some [[Egyptian uniliteral signs|24 hieroglyphs]] which are called uniliterals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A2451890 |title=The Development of the Western Alphabet |accessdate=2008-08-04 |author=Lynn, Bernadette |date=2004-04-08 |work=h2g2 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; to represent syllables that begin with a single [[consonant]] of their language, plus a vowel (or no vowel) to be supplied by the native speaker. These glyphs were used as pronunciation guides for [[logogram]]s, to write grammatical inflections, and, later, to transcribe loan words and foreign names.&lt;ref name=Daniels&gt;Daniels and Bright (1996), pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ba`alat.png|thumb|left|A specimen of [[Proto-Sinaitic script]], one of the earliest (if not the very first) phonemic scripts]]
In the [[Middle Bronze Age]] an apparently &quot;alphabetic&quot; system known as the [[Proto-Sinaitic script]] appears in Egyptian turquoise mines in the [[Sinai peninsula]] dated to circa the 15th century BC, apparently left by Canaanite workers. In 1999, John and Deborah Darnell discovered an even earlier version of this first alphabet at Wadi el-Hol dated to circa 1800 BC and showing evidence of having been adapted from specific forms of Egyptian hieroglyphs that could be dated to circa 2000 BC, strongly suggesting that the first alphabet had been developed circa that time.&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Darnell, F. W. Dobbs-Allsopp, Marilyn J. Lundberg, P. Kyle McCarter, and Bruce Zuckermanet, “Two early alphabetic inscriptions from the Wadi el-Hol: new evidence for the origin of the alphabet from the western desert of Egypt.” The Annual of the American Schools of Oriental Research, 59 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Based on letter appearances and names, it is believed to be based on Egyptian hieroglyphs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coulmas 140&quot;&gt;Coulmas (1989), p. 140–141.&lt;/ref&gt; This script had no characters representing vowels. An alphabetic [[cuneiform]] script with 30 signs including three which indicate the following vowel was invented in [[Ugarit]] before the 15th century BC. This script was not used after the destruction of Ugarit.&lt;ref&gt;''Ugaritic Writing'' [http://www.mazzaroth.com/ChapterThree/UgariticWriting.htm online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Proto-Sinaitic script eventually developed into the [[Phoenician alphabet]], which is conventionally called &quot;Proto-Canaanite&quot; before ca. 1050 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniels 9296&quot;/&gt; The oldest text in Phoenician script is an inscription on the sarcophagus of King [[Ahiram]]. This script is the parent script of all western alphabets. By the tenth century two other forms can be distinguished namely [[Canaanite language|Canaanite]] and [[Aramaic]]. The Aramaic gave rise to [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Coulmas&quot;(1989),p.142&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[South Arabian alphabet]], a sister script to the Phoenician alphabet, is the script from which the [[Ge'ez alphabet]] (an [[abugida]]) is descended. Vowelless alphabets, which are not true alphabets, are called [[abjad]]s, currently exemplified in scripts including [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], and [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]]. The omission of vowels was not a satisfactory solution and some &quot;weak&quot; consonants were used to indicate the vowel quality of a syllable ([[Mater lectionis|matres lectionis]]). These had dual function since they were also used as pure consonants.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Coulmas&quot; (1989) p.147.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Proto-Sinatic or Proto Canaanite script and the [[Ugaritic script]] were the first scripts with limited number of signs, in contrast to the other widely used writing systems at the time, [[Cuneiform]], [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], and [[Linear B]]. The Phoenician script was probably the first phonemic script&lt;ref name=&quot;Coulmas 140&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniels 9296&quot;&gt;Daniels and Bright (1996), pp 92-96&lt;/ref&gt; and it contained only about two dozen distinct letters, making it a script simple enough for common traders to learn. Another advantage of Phoenician was that it could be used to write down many different languages, since it recorded words phonemically.

The script was spread by the Phoenicians, across the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniels 9296&quot; /&gt; In Greece, the script was modified to add the vowels, giving rise to the ancestor of all alphabets in the West. The indication of the vowels is the same way as the indication of the consonants, therefore it was the first true alphabet. The Greeks took letters which did not represent sounds that existed in Greek, and changed them to represent the vowels. The vowels are significant in the Greek language, and the syllabical [[Linear B]] script which was used by the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] Greeks from the 16th century BC had 87 symbols including 5 vowels. In its early years, there were many variants of the Greek alphabet, a situation which caused many different alphabets to evolve from it.

===European alphabets===
[[File:ZographensisColour.jpg|thumb|[[Codex Zographensis]] in the [[Glagolitic alphabet]] from Medieval [[Bulgaria]]]]
The [[Greek alphabet]], in its [[Euboean alphabet|Euboean form]], was carried over by Greek colonists to the Italian peninsula, where it gave rise to a variety of alphabets used to write the [[Italic languages]]. One of these became the [[Latin alphabet]], which was spread across Europe as the Romans expanded their empire. Even after the fall of the Roman state, the alphabet survived in intellectual and religious works. It eventually became used for the descendant languages of Latin (the [[Romance languages]]) and then for most of the other languages of Europe.

Some adaptations of the Latin alphabet are augmented with [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]], such as [[æ]] in [[Old English language|Old English]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Ou (letter)|Ȣ]] in [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]; by borrowings from other alphabets, such as the [[thorn (letter)|thorn]] þ in [[Old English language|Old English]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], which came from the [[Runic alphabet|Futhark]] runes; and by modifying existing letters, such as the [[Eth (letter)|eth]] ð of Old English and Icelandic, which is a modified ''d''. Other alphabets only use a subset of the Latin alphabet, such as Hawaiian, and [[Italian language|Italian]], which uses the letters ''j, k, x, y'' and ''w'' only in foreign words.

Another notable script is [[Elder Futhark]], which is believed to have evolved out of one of the [[Old Italic alphabet]]s. Elder Futhark gave rise to a variety of alphabets known collectively as the [[Runic alphabet]]s. The Runic alphabets were used for Germanic languages from AD 100 to the late Middle Ages. Its usage is mostly restricted to engravings on stone and jewelry, although inscriptions have also been found on bone and wood. These alphabets have since been replaced with the Latin alphabet, except for decorative usage for which the runes remained in use until the 20th century.

The [[Old Hungarian script]] is a contemporary writing system of the Hungarians. It was in use during the entire history of Hungary, albeit not as an official writing system. From the 19th century it once again became more and more popular.

The [[Glagolitic alphabet]] was the initial script of the liturgical language [[Old Church Slavonic]] and became, together with the Greek uncial script, the basis of the [[Cyrillic script]]. Cyrillic is one of the most widely used modern alphabetic scripts, and is notable for its use in Slavic languages and also for other languages within the former [[Soviet Union]]. [[Cyrillic alphabets]] include the [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian]], [[Macedonian alphabet|Macedonian]], [[Bulgarian alphabet|Bulgarian]], and [[Russian alphabet]]s. The Glagolitic alphabet is believed to have been created by [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]], while the Cyrillic alphabet was invented by the Bulgarian scholar [[Clement of Ohrid]], who was their disciple. They feature many letters that appear to have been borrowed from or influenced by the [[Greek alphabet]] and the [[Hebrew alphabet]].

===Asian alphabets===
Beyond the logographic [[Written Chinese|Chinese writing]], many phonetic scripts are in existence in Asia. The [[Arabic alphabet]], [[Hebrew alphabet]], [[Syriac alphabet]], and other [[abjad]]s of the Middle East are developments of the [[Aramaic alphabet]], but because these writing systems are largely [[consonant]]-based they are often not considered true alphabets.

Most alphabetic scripts of India and Eastern Asia are descended from the [[Brahmi script]], which is often believed to be a descendant of Aramaic.

[[File:Zhuyin on cell phone detail.jpeg|thumb|left|250px|[[Zhuyin]] on a cell phone]]

In [[Korea]], the [[Hangul]] alphabet was created by [[Sejong the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;上親制諺文二十八字…是謂訓民正音(His majesty created 28 characters himself... It is [[Hunminjeongeum]] (original name for [[Hangul]]))&quot;, 《세종실록 (The Annals of the Choson Dynasty : Sejong)》 25년 12월.&lt;/ref&gt; Hangul is a unique alphabet: it is a [[featural alphabet]], where many of the letters are designed from a sound's place of articulation (P to look like the widened mouth, L to look like the tongue pulled in, etc.); its design was planned by the government of the day; and it places individual letters in syllable clusters with equal dimensions, in the same way as [[Chinese characters]], to allow for mixed-script writing{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} (one syllable always takes up one type-space no matter how many letters get stacked into building that one sound-block).

[[Zhuyin]] (sometimes called ''Bopomofo'') is a [[semi-syllabary]] used to phonetically transcribe [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]] in the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]]. After the later establishment of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] and its adoption of [[Pinyin|Hanyu Pinyin]], the use of Zhuyin today is limited, but it's still widely used in [[Taiwan]] where the Republic of China still governs. Zhuyin developed out of a form of Chinese shorthand based on Chinese characters in the early 1900s and has elements of both an alphabet and a syllabary. Like an alphabet the phonemes of [[syllable onset|syllable initials]] are represented by individual symbols, but like a syllabary the phonemes of the [[syllable rime|syllable finals]] are not; rather, each possible final (excluding the [[Syllable#Medial and final|medial glide]]) is represented by its own symbol. For example, ''luan'' is represented as ㄌㄨㄢ (''l-u-an''), where the last symbol ㄢ represents the entire final ''-an''. While Zhuyin is not used as a mainstream writing system, it is still often used in ways similar to a [[romanization]] system—that is, for aiding in pronunciation and as an input method for Chinese characters on computers and cellphones.

European alphabets, especially Latin and Cyrillic, have been adapted for many languages of Asia. Arabic is also widely used, sometimes as an abjad (as with [[Urdu alphabet|Urdu]] and [[Persian alphabet|Persian]]) and sometimes as a complete alphabet (as with [[Kurdish alphabet|Kurdish]] and [[Uyghur alphabet|Uyghur]]).

{{alphabet}}

The term &quot;alphabet&quot; is used by [[Linguistics|linguists]] and [[paleographer]]s in both a wide and a narrow sense. In the wider sense, an alphabet is a script that is ''segmental'' at the [[phoneme]] level—that is, it has separate glyphs for individual sounds and not for larger units such as syllables or words. In the narrower sense, some scholars distinguish &quot;true&quot; alphabets from two other types of segmental script, [[abjad]]s and [[abugida]]s. These three differ from each other in the way they treat vowels: abjads have letters for consonants and leave most vowels unexpressed; abugidas are also consonant-based, but indicate vowels with [[diacritic]]s to or a systematic graphic modification of the consonants. In alphabets in the narrow sense, on the other hand, consonants and vowels are written as independent letters.&lt;ref&gt;For critics of the abjad-abugida-alphabet distinction, see Reinhard G. Lehmann: &quot;27-30-22-26. How Many Letters Needs an Alphabet? The Case of Semitic&quot;, in: The idea of writing: Writing across borders / edited by Alex de Voogt and Joachim Friedrich Quack, Leiden: Brill 2012, p. 11-52, esp p. 22-27&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known alphabet in the wider sense is the [[Middle Bronze Age alphabets|Wadi el-Hol script]], believed to be an abjad, which through its successor [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] is the ancestor of modern alphabets, including [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] (via the [[Old Italic alphabet]]), [[Cyrillic]] (via the Greek alphabet) and [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] (via [[Aramaic]]).

Examples of present-day abjads are the [[Arabic script|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew script]]s; true alphabets include [[Latin script|Latin]], Cyrillic, and Korean [[hangul]]; and abugidas are used to write [[tigrinya language|Tigrinya]], [[Amharic language|Amharic]], [[Hindi]], and [[Thai language|Thai]]. The [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics]] are also an abugida rather than a syllabary as their name would imply, since each glyph stands for a consonant which is modified by rotation to represent the following vowel. (In a true syllabary, each consonant-vowel combination would be represented by a separate glyph.)

All three types may be augmented with syllabic glyphs. [[Ugaritic script|Ugaritic]], for example, is basically an abjad, but has syllabic letters for {{IPA|/ʔa, ʔi, ʔu/}}. (These are the only time vowels are indicated.) Cyrillic is basically a true alphabet, but has syllabic letters for {{IPA|/ja, je, ju/}} (я, е, ю); [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic]] has a letter for {{IPA|/ti/}}. [[Devanagari]] is typically an abugida augmented with dedicated letters for initial vowels, though some traditions use अ as a [[zero consonant]] as the graphic base for such vowels.

The boundaries between the three types of segmental scripts are not always clear-cut. For example, [[Sorani]] [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] is written in the [[Arabic script]], which is normally an abjad. However, in Kurdish, writing the vowels is mandatory, and full letters are used, so the script is a true alphabet. Other languages may use a Semitic abjad with mandatory vowel diacritics, effectively making them abugidas. On the other hand, the [[Phagspa script]] of the [[Mongol Empire]] was based closely on the [[Tibetan script|Tibetan abugida]], but all vowel marks were written after the preceding consonant rather than as diacritic marks. Although short ''a'' was not written, as in the Indic abugidas, one could argue that the linear arrangement made this a true alphabet. Conversely, the vowel marks of the [[Ge'ez alphabet|Tigrinya abugida]] and the [[Ge'ez alphabet|Amharic abugida]] (ironically, the original source of the term &quot;abugida&quot;) have been so completely assimilated into their consonants that the modifications are no longer systematic and have to be learned as a syllabary rather than as a segmental script. Even more extreme, the Pahlavi abjad eventually became [[logogram|logographic]]. (See below.)
[[File:Ethiopic genesis.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Ge'ez Script]] of [[Ethiopia]]]]
Thus the primary [[Categorisation|classification]] of alphabets reflects how they treat vowels. For [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal languages]], further classification can be based on their treatment of tone, though names do not yet exist to distinguish the various types. Some alphabets disregard tone entirely, especially when it does not carry a heavy functional load, as in [[Somali language|Somali]] and many other languages of Africa and the Americas. Such scripts are to tone what abjads are to vowels. Most commonly, tones are indicated with diacritics, the way vowels are treated in abugidas. This is the case for [[Vietnamese alphabet|Vietnamese]] (a true alphabet) and [[Thai alphabet|Thai]] (an abugida). In Thai, tone is determined primarily by the choice of consonant, with diacritics for disambiguation. In the [[Pollard script]], an abugida, vowels are indicated by diacritics, but the placement of the diacritic relative to the consonant is modified to indicate the tone. More rarely, a script may have separate letters for tones, as is the case for [[Hmong alphabet|Hmong]] and [[Zhuang alphabet|Zhuang]]. For most of these scripts, regardless of whether letters or diacritics are used, the most common tone is not marked, just as the most common vowel is not marked in Indic abugidas; in [[Zhuyin]] not only is one of the tones unmarked, but there is a diacritic to indicate lack of tone, like the [[virama]] of Indic.

The number of letters in an alphabet can be quite small. The Book [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] script, an abjad, had only twelve letters at one point, and may have had even fewer later on. Today the [[Rotokas alphabet]] has only twelve letters. (The [[Hawaiian alphabet]] is sometimes claimed to be as small, but it actually consists of 18 letters, including the [[ʻokina]] and five long vowels.  However, [[Hawaiian Braille]] has only 13 letters.) While Rotokas has a small alphabet because it has few phonemes to represent (just eleven), Book Pahlavi was small because many letters had been ''conflated''—that is, the graphic distinctions had been lost over time, and diacritics were not developed to compensate for this as they were in [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], another script that lost many of its distinct letter shapes. For example, a comma-shaped letter represented ''g, d, y, k,'' or ''j''. However, such apparent simplifications can perversely make a script more complicated. In later Pahlavi [[papyrus|papyri]], up to half of the remaining graphic distinctions of these twelve letters were lost, and the script could no longer be read as a sequence of letters at all, but instead each word had to be learned as a whole—that is, they had become [[logogram]]s as in Egyptian [[Demotic Egyptian|Demotic]].

The largest segmental script is probably an abugida, [[Devanagari]]. When written in Devanagari, Vedic [[Sanskrit]] has an alphabet of 53 letters, including the ''visarga'' mark for final aspiration and special letters for ''kš'' and ''jñ,'' though one of the letters is theoretical and not actually used. The Hindi alphabet must represent both Sanskrit and modern vocabulary, and so has been expanded to 58 with the ''khutma'' letters (letters with a dot added) to represent sounds from Persian and English. Thai has a total of 59 symbols, consisting of 44 consonants, 13 vowels and 2 syllabics, not including 4 diacritics for tone marks and one for vowel length.

The largest known abjad is [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], with 51 letters. The largest alphabets in the narrow sense include [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]] and [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]] (for [[Cyrillic]]), with 58 and 56 letters, respectively, and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] (for the [[Latin script]]), with 46. However, these scripts either count [[digraph (orthography)|di- and tri-graphs]] as separate letters, as Spanish did with ''ch'' and ''ll'' until recently, or uses [[diacritic]]s like Slovak ''č''. The largest true alphabet where each letter is graphically independent is probably [[Georgian alphabet|Georgian]], with 41 letters.

Syllabaries typically contain 50 to 400 glyphs, and the glyphs of logographic systems typically number from the many hundreds into the thousands. Thus a simple count of the number of distinct symbols is an important clue to the nature of an unknown script.

==Alphabetical order==
{{main|Alphabetical order}}
Alphabets often come to be associated with a standard ordering of their letters, which can then be used for purposes of [[collation]] – namely for the listing of words and other items in what is called ''[[alphabetical order]]''.

The Case of Semitic&quot;, in: The idea of writing: Writing across borders / edited by Alex de Voogt and Joachim Friedrich Quack, Leiden: Brill 2012, p. 11-52&lt;/ref&gt; is well established, although languages using this alphabet have different conventions for their treatment of modified letters (such as the [[French language|French]] ''é'', ''à'', and ''ô'') and of certain combinations of letters ([[Multigraph (orthography)|multigraph]]s). In French, these are not considered to be additional letters for the purposes of collation. However, in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], the accented letters such as ''á'', ''í'', and ''ö'' are considered to be distinct letters of the alphabet. In Spanish, ''ñ'' is considered a separate letter, but accented vowels such as ''á'' and ''é'' are not. The ''ll'' and ''ch'' were also considered single letters, but in 1994 the [[Real Academia Española]] changed the collating order so that ''ll'' is between ''lk'' and ''lm'' in the dictionary and ''ch'' is between ''cg'' and ''ci'', and in 2010 the tenth congress of the [[Association of Spanish Language Academies]] changed it so they were no longer letters at all&lt;ref&gt;Real Academia Española. &quot;Spanish Pronto!: Spanish Alphabet.&quot; Spanish Pronto! 22 April 2007. January 2009 [http://www.spanishpronto.com/spanishpronto/spanishalphabet.html#english Spanish Pronto: Spanish ↔ English Medical Translators.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;La “i griega” se llamará “ye”&quot;. Cuba Debate. 2010-11-05. Retrieved 12 December 2010. [http://www.cubadebate.cu/noticias/2010/11/05/la-i-griega-se-llamara-ye-y-la-ch-y-la-ll-desaparecen-por-decreto-de-la-academia-espanola/ Cubadebate.cu]&lt;/ref&gt;

In German, words starting with ''sch-'' (which spells the German phoneme {{IPAslink|ʃ}}) are inserted between words with initial ''sca-'' and ''sci-'' (all incidentally loanwords) instead of appearing after initial ''sz'', as though it were a single letter—in contrast to several languages such as [[Albanian alphabet|Albanian]], in which ''dh-'', ''ë-'', ''gj-'', ''ll-'', ''rr-'', ''th-'', ''xh-'' and ''zh-'' (all representing phonemes and considered separate single letters) would follow the letters ''d'', ''e'', ''g'', ''l'', ''n'', ''r'', ''t'', ''x'' and ''z'' respectively, as well as Hungarian and Welsh. Further, German words with [[umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]] are collated ignoring the umlaut—contrary to [[Turkish alphabet|Turkish]] which allegedly adopted the [[German alphabet|German]] [[grapheme]]s '''ö''' and '''ü''', and where a word like ''tüfek'', would come after ''tuz'', in the dictionary. An exception is the German telephone directory where umlauts are sorted like ''ä'' = ''ae'' since names as ''Jäger'' appear also with the spelling ''Jaeger'', and are not distinguished in the spoken language.

The [[Danish and Norwegian alphabet]]s end with ''æ''—''ø''—''å'', whereas the Icelandic, Swedish and Finnish ones conventionally put ''å''—''ä''—''ö'' at the end.

It is unknown whether the earliest alphabets had a defined sequence. Some alphabets today, such as the [[Hanuno'o script]], are learned one letter at a time, in no particular order, and are not used for [[collation]] where a definite order is required. However, a dozen [[Ugaritic alphabet|Ugaritic]] tablets from the fourteenth century BC preserve the alphabet in two sequences. One, the ''ABCDE'' order later used in Phoenician, has continued with minor changes in [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[Armenian alphabet|Armenian]], [[Gothic alphabet|Gothic]], [[Cyrillic]], and [[Latin alphabet|Latin]]; the other, ''HMĦLQ,'' was used in southern Arabia and is preserved today in [[Ge'ez alphabet|Ethiopic]].&lt;ref&gt;Millard, A.R. &quot;The Infancy of the Alphabet&quot;, ''World Archaeology'' 17, No. 3, Early Writing Systems (February 1986): 390–398. page 395.&lt;/ref&gt; Both orders have therefore been stable for at least 3000 years.

The historical order was abandoned in [[Runic alphabet|Runic]] and [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], although Arabic retains the traditional [[abjadi order]] for numbering.

The [[Brahmic family]] of alphabets used in India use a unique order based on [[phonology]]: The letters are arranged according to how and where they are produced in the mouth. This organization is used in Southeast Asia, Tibet, Korean [[hangul]], and even Japanese [[kana]], which is not an alphabet.

==Names of letters==
The Phoenician letter names, in which each letter was associated with a word that begins with that sound, continue to be used to varying degrees in [[Samaritan alphabet|Samaritan]], [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]], [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]], [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]]. The names were abandoned in [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], which instead referred to the letters by adding a vowel (usually e) before or after the consonant (the exception is zeta, which was retained from Greek). In Cyrillic originally the letters were given names based on Slavic words; this was later abandoned as well in favor of a system similar to that used in Latin.

==Orthography and pronunciation==
{{main|Phonemic orthography}}
When an alphabet is adopted or developed to represent a given language, an [[orthography]] generally comes into being, providing rules for the [[spelling]] of words in that language. In accordance with the principle on which alphabets are based, these rules will generally map letters of the alphabet to the [[phoneme]]s (significant sounds) of the spoken language. In a perfectly [[phonemic orthography]] there would be a consistent one-to-one correspondence between the letters and the phonemes, so that a writer could predict the spelling of a word given its pronunciation, and a speaker would always know the pronunciation of a word given its spelling, and vice versa. However this ideal is not usually achieved in practice; some languages (such as [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]]) come close to it, while others (such as English) deviate from it to a much larger degree.

The pronunciation of a language often evolves independently of its writing system, and writing systems have been borrowed for languages they were not designed for, so the degree to which letters of an alphabet correspond to phonemes of a language varies greatly from one language to another and even within a single language.

Languages may fail to achieve a one-to-one correspondence between letters and sounds in any of several ways:
* A language may represent a given phoneme by a combination of letters rather than just a single letter. Two-letter combinations are called [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s and three-letter groups are called [[trigraph (orthography)|trigraph]]s. [[German language|German]] uses the [[tetragraph]]s (four letters) &quot;tsch&quot; for the phoneme {{IPA-de|tʃ|}} and (in a few borrowed words) &quot;dsch&quot; for {{IPA|[dʒ]}}. [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]] also uses a tetragraph for one of its phonemes, namely &quot;кхъу&quot;. Two letters representing one sound occur in several instances in Hungarian as well (where, for instance, ''cs'' stands for [č], ''sz'' for [s], ''zs'' for [ž], ''dzs'' for [ǰ]).
* A language may represent the same phoneme with two or more different letters or combinations of letters. An example is [[modern Greek]] which may write the phoneme {{IPA-el|i|}} in six different ways: {{angbr|ι}}, {{angbr|η}}, {{angbr|υ}}, {{angbr|ει}}, {{angbr|οι}}, and {{angbr|υι}} (though the last is rare).
* A language may spell some words with unpronounced letters that exist for historical or other reasons. For example, the spelling of the Thai word for &quot;beer&quot; [เบียร์] retains a letter for the final consonant &quot;r&quot; present in the English word it was borrowed from, but silences it.
* Pronunciation of individual words may change according to the presence of surrounding words in a sentence ([[sandhi]]).
* Different dialects of a language may use different phonemes for the same word.
* A language may use different sets of symbols or different rules for distinct sets of vocabulary items, such as the Japanese [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]] syllabaries, or the various rules in English for spelling words from Latin and Greek, or the original [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] vocabulary.

National languages sometimes elect to address the problem of dialects by simply associating the alphabet with the national standard. However, with an international language with wide variations in its dialects, such as [[English language|English]], it would be impossible to represent the language in all its variations with a single phonetic alphabet.

Some national languages like [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] ([[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]]) and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] have a very regular spelling system with a nearly one-to-one correspondence between letters and phonemes. Strictly speaking, these national languages lack a word corresponding to the verb &quot;to spell&quot; (meaning to split a word into its letters), the closest match being a verb meaning to split a word into its syllables. Similarly, the [[Italian language|Italian]] verb corresponding to 'spell (out)', ''compitare'', is unknown to many Italians because spelling is usually trivial, as Italian spelling is highly phonemic. In standard [[Spanish language|Spanish]], one can tell the pronunciation of a word from its spelling, but not vice versa, as certain phonemes can be represented in more than one way, but a given letter is consistently pronounced. [[French language|French]], with its [[silent letter]]s and its heavy use of [[nasal vowel]]s and [[elision]], may seem to lack much correspondence between spelling and pronunciation, but its rules on pronunciation, though complex, are actually consistent and predictable with a fair degree of accuracy.

At the other extreme are languages such as English, where the pronunciations of many words simply have to be memorized as they do not correspond to the spelling in a consistent way. For English, this is partly because the [[Great Vowel Shift]] occurred after the orthography was established, and because English has acquired a large number of loanwords at different times, retaining their original spelling at varying levels. Even English has general, albeit complex, rules that predict pronunciation from spelling, and these rules are successful most of the time; rules to predict spelling from the pronunciation have a higher failure rate.

Sometimes, countries have the written language undergo a [[spelling reform]] to realign the writing with the contemporary spoken language. These can range from simple spelling changes and word forms to switching the entire writing system itself, as when [[Turkey]] switched from the Arabic alphabet to a [[Turkish alphabet]] of Latin origin.

The sounds of speech of all languages of the world can be written by a rather-small universal phonetic-alphabet. A standard for this is the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]].

[[File:Atomic number depiction.jpg|thumb|Atomic Number Depiction|300px|right|An explanation of the superscripts and subscripts seen in atomic number notation. Atomic number is the number of protons, and therefore also the total positive charge, in the atomic nucleus.]]
[[Image:Bohr-atom-PAR.svg|thumb|right|300px|The '''Rutherford–Bohr model''' of the [[hydrogen atom]] ({{nowrap|''Z'' {{=}} 1}}) or a hydrogen-like ion ({{nowrap|''Z'' &gt; 1}}). In this model it is an essential feature that the photon energy (or frequency) of the electromagnetic radiation emitted (shown) when an electron jumps from one orbital to another, be proportional to the mathematical square of atomic charge ({{nowrap|''Z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''}}). Experimental measurement by [[Henry Moseley]] of this radiation for many elements (from {{nowrap|''Z'' {{=}} 13 to 92}}) showed the results as predicted by Bohr. Both the concept of atomic number and the Bohr model were thereby given scientific credence.]]
In [[chemistry]] and [[physics]], the '''atomic number''' of a [[chemical element]] (also known as its '''proton number''') is the number of [[proton]]s found in the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of an [[atom]] of that element, and therefore identical to the [[charge number]] of the nucleus. It is conventionally represented by the symbol '''''Z'''''. The atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element. In an [[electric charge|uncharged]] atom, the atomic number is also equal to the number of [[electron]]s.

The atomic number, ''Z'', should not be confused with the [[mass number]], ''A'', which is the number of [[nucleon]]s, the total number of protons and [[neutron]]s in the nucleus of an atom. The number of neutrons, ''N'', is known as the [[neutron number]] of the atom; thus, ''A'' = ''Z'' + ''N'' (these quantities are always [[natural number|whole numbers]]). Since protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass (and the mass of the electrons is [[negligible]] for many purposes) and the [[Binding energy#Mass_change|mass defect]] of nucleon binding is always small compared to the nucleon mass, the [[atomic mass]] of any atom, when expressed in [[Atomic mass unit|unified atomic mass units]] (making a quantity called the &quot;[[atomic mass|relative isotopic mass]],&quot;) is roughly (to within 1%) equal to the whole number ''A''.

Atoms with the same atomic number ''Z'' but different neutron numbers ''N'', and hence different atomic masses, are known as [[isotope]]s. A little more than three-quarters of naturally occurring elements exist as a mixture of isotopes (see [[monoisotopic element]]s), and the average isotopic mass of an isotopic mixture for an element (called the relative atomic mass) in a defined environment on Earth, determines the element's standard [[atomic weight]]. Historically, it was these atomic weights of elements (in comparison to hydrogen) that were the quantities measurable by chemists in the 19th century.

The conventional symbol ''Z'' comes from the [[German language|German]] word {{lang|de|'''''Z'''ahl''}} meaning number/numeral/figure, which, prior to the modern synthesis of ideas from chemistry and physics, merely denoted an element's numerical place in the [[periodic table]], whose order is approximately, but not completely, consistent with the order of the elements by atomic weights. Only after 1915, with the suggestion and evidence that this ''Z'' number was also the nuclear charge and a physical characteristic of atoms, did the word {{lang|de|''Atom'''z'''ahl''}} (and its English equivalent ''atomic number'') come into common use in this context.

==History==

===The periodic table and a natural number for each element===
[[File:DIMendeleevCab.jpg|150px|left|thumb|Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev created a periodic table of the elements that ordered them numerically by atomic weight, yet occasionally used chemical properties in contradiction to weight.]]
Loosely speaking, the existence or construction of a [[periodic table]] of elements creates an ordering of the elements, and so they can be numbered in order.

[[Dmitri Mendeleev]] claimed that he arranged his first periodic tables in order of [[atomic weight]] (&quot;Atomgewicht&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;dm1869&quot;&gt;[http://www.aip.org/history/curie/periodic.htm The Periodic Table of Elements], American Institute of Physics&lt;/ref&gt; However, in consideration of the elements' observed chemical properties, he changed the order slightly and placed [[tellurium]] (atomic weight 127.6) ahead of [[iodine]] (atomic weight 126.9).&lt;ref name=&quot;dm1869&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsc.org/chemsoc/visualelements/pages/history_ii.html The Development of the Periodic Table], Chemsoc&lt;/ref&gt; This placement is consistent with the modern practice of ordering the elements by proton number, ''Z'', but that number was not known or suspected at the time.

A simple numbering based on periodic table position was never entirely satisfactory, however. Besides the case of iodine and tellurium, later several other pairs of elements (such as argon and potassium, cobalt and nickel) were known to have nearly identical or reversed atomic weights, thus requiring their placement in the periodic table to be determined by their chemical properties. However the gradual identification of more and more chemically similar [[lanthanide]] elements, whoise atomic number was not obvious, led to inconsistency and uncertainty in the periodic numbering of elements at least from [[lutetium]] (element 71) onwards ([[hafnium]] was not known at this time). 

[[File:Ernest Rutherford cropped.jpg|140px|left|thumb|Ernest Rutherford's 1911 interpretation of work in his laboratory identified the atomic nucleus, and suggested the number of charges on the nucleus of gold (79 on the periodic table) was about 100.]]
[[File:Niels Bohr.jpg|140px|left|thumb|Niels Bohr's 1913 [[Bohr model]] of the atom required van den Broek's atomic number of nuclear charges, and Bohr believed that Moseley's work contributed greatly to the acceptance of the model.]]
[[File:Henry Moseley.jpg|140px|thumb|Henry Moseley helped develop the concept of atomic number by showing experimentally (1913) that 
Van den Broek's 1911 hypothesis combined with the [[Bohr model]] nearly correctly predicted atomic X-ray emissions.]]

===The Rutherford-Bohr model and van den Broek===
In 1911, [[Ernest Rutherford]] gave a [[Rutherford model|model]] of the atom in which a central core held most of the atom's mass and a positive charge which, in units of the electron's charge, was to be approximately equal to half of the atom's atomic weight, expressed in numbers of hydrogen atoms. This central charge would thus be approximately half the atomic weight (though it was almost 25% different from the atomic number of gold (''Z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;79, ''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;197), the single element from which Rutherford made his guess). Nevertheless, in spite of Rutherford's estimation that gold had a central charge of about 100 (but was element Z = 79 on the periodic table), a month after Rutherford's paper appeared, [[Antonius van den Broek]] first formally suggested that the central charge and number of electrons in an atom was ''exactly'' equal to its place in the periodic table (also known as element number, atomic number, and symbolized ''Z''). This proved eventually to be the case.

=== Moseley's 1913 experiment ===
The experimental position improved dramatically after research by [[Henry Moseley]] in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsc.org/Education/Teachers/Resources/periodictable/pre16/order.doc Ordering the Elements in the Periodic Table], Royal Chemical Society&lt;/ref&gt; Moseley, after discussions with Bohr who was at the same lab (and who had used Van den Broek's hypothesis in his [[Bohr model]] of the atom), decided to test Van den Broek's and Bohr's hypothesis directly, by seeing if spectral lines emitted from excited atoms fitted the Bohr theory's postulation that the frequency of the spectral lines be proportional to the square of ''Z''.

To do this, Moseley measured the wavelengths of the innermost photon transitions (K and L lines) produced by the elements from aluminum (''Z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;13) to gold (''Z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;79) used as a series of movable anodic targets inside an [[x-ray tube]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemistry.co.nz/henry_moseley_article.htm Moseley's paper with illustrations]&lt;/ref&gt; The square root of the frequency of these photons (x-rays) increased from one target to the next in an arithmetic progression. This led to the conclusion ([[Moseley's law]]) that the atomic number does closely correspond (with an offset of one unit for K-lines, in Moseley's work) to the calculated [[electric charge]] of the nucleus, i.e. the element number ''Z''. Among other things, Moseley demonstrated that the [[lanthanide]] series (from [[lanthanum]] to [[lutetium]] inclusive) must have 15 members—no fewer and no more—which was far from obvious from the chemistry at that time.

===The proton and the idea of nuclear electrons===
In 1915 the reason for nuclear charge being quantized in units of Z, which were now recognized to be the same as the element number, was not understood. An old idea called [[Prout's hypothesis]] had postulated that the elements were all made of residues (or &quot;protyles&quot;) of the lightest element hydrogen, which in the Bohr-Rutherford model had a single electron and a nuclear charge of one. However, as early as 1907 Rutherford and [[Thomas Royds]] had shown that alpha particles, which had a charge of +2, were the nuclei of helium atoms, which had a mass four times that of hydrogen, not two times. If Prout's hypothesis were true, something had to be neutralizing some of the charge of the hydrogen nuclei present in the nuclei of heavier atoms.

In 1917 Rutherford succeeded in generating hydrogen nuclei from a [[nuclear reaction]] between alpha particles and nitrogen gas, and believed he had proven Prout's law. He called the new heavy nuclear particles protons in 1920 (alternate names being proutons and protyles). It had been immediately apparent from the work of Moseley that the nuclei of heavy atoms have more than twice as much mass as would be expected from their being made of [[hydrogen]] nuclei, and thus there was required a hypothesis for the neutralization of the extra [[protons]] presumed present in all heavy nuclei. A helium nucleus was presumed to be composed of four protons plus two &quot;nuclear electrons&quot; (electrons bound inside the nucleus) to cancel two of the charges. At the other end of the periodic table, a nucleus of gold with a mass 197 times that of hydrogen, was thought to contain 118 nuclear electrons in the nucleus to give it a residual charge of + 79, consistent with its atomic number.

===The discovery of the neutron makes Z the proton number===
All consideration of nuclear electrons ended with [[James Chadwick]]'s discovery of the neutron in 1932. An atom of gold now was seen as containing 118 neutrons rather than 118 nuclear electrons, and its positive charge now was realized to come entirely from a content of 79 protons. After 1932, therefore, an element's atomic number Z was also realized to be identical to the [[proton number]] of its nuclei.

==The symbol of Z==
The conventional symbol ''Z'' possibly comes from the [[German language|German]] word {{lang|de|''Atom'''z'''ahl''}} (atomic number).&lt;ref&gt;[http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/atoms/faq/why-is-atomic-number-Z.shtml Origin of symbol Z]&lt;/ref&gt; However, prior to 1915, the word ''Zahl'' (simply ''number'') was used for an element's assigned number in the periodic table.

==Chemical properties==
Each element has a specific set of chemical properties as a consequence of the number of electrons present in the neutral atom, which is ''Z'' (the atomic number). The [[electron configuration|configuration]] of these electrons follows from the principles of [[quantum mechanics]]. The number of electrons in each element's [[electron shell]]s, particularly the outermost [[valence shell]], is the primary factor in determining its [[chemical bonding]] behavior. Hence, it is the atomic number alone that determines the chemical properties of an element; and it is for this reason that an element can be defined as consisting of ''any'' mixture of atoms with a given atomic number.

==New elements==
The quest for new elements is usually described using atomic numbers. As of 2010, elements with atomic numbers 1 to 118 have been observed. Synthesis of new elements is accomplished by bombarding target atoms of heavy elements with ions, such that the sum of the atomic numbers of the target and ion elements equals the atomic number of the element being created. In general, the [[half-life]] becomes shorter as atomic number increases, though an &quot;[[island of stability]]&quot; may exist for undiscovered isotopes with certain numbers of protons and neutrons.

'''Anatomy''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀνατέμνω}} ''anatemnō'' &quot;I cut up, cut open&quot; from ἀνά ''ana'' &quot;on, upon&quot;, and τέμνω ''temnō'' &quot;I cut&quot;) is the study of the [[body plan]] of animals. In some of its facets, anatomy is closely related to [[embryology]], [[comparative anatomy]] and [[Phylogenetics|comparative embryology]],&lt;ref name=&quot;intro HGray&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bartleby.com/107/1.html| title= Introduction page, &quot;Anatomy of the Human Body&quot;. Henry Gray. 20th edition. 1918| accessdate =19 March 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070316005206/http://www.bartleby.com/107/1.html| archivedate= 16 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; through common roots in [[evolution]]. [[Human anatomy]] is important in medicine.

The discipline of anatomy is subdivided into gross (or [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]]) anatomy and [[Microscopic scale|microscopic]] anatomy. [[Gross anatomy]] is the study of structures that can, when suitably presented or [[dissection|dissected]], be seen by unaided vision with the naked eye. [[Microscopic anatomy]] is the study of structures on a microscopic scale, including [[histology]] (the study of tissues) and [[Cell biology|cytology]] (the study of cells).

The [[history of anatomy]] is characterized by a continual development in understanding of the functions of the [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s and structures of the [[human body]]. Methods have also improved dramatically, advancing from examination of animals through dissection of [[cadaver]]s (dead human bodies) to 20th century techniques including [[X-ray machine|X-ray]], [[Ultrasound imaging|ultrasound]], and [[MRI|magnetic resonance imaging]].

== Overview ==
Anatomy is the scientific study of the structure of living things including their systems, organs, and tissues. It includes the appearance and position of the various parts, the materials from which they are composed, their locations and their relationships with other parts. Anatomy is quite distinct from physiology and biochemistry, which deal with the functions of those parts. For example, an anatomist is concerned with the shape, size, position, structure, blood supply and enervation of an organ such as the liver, while a physiologist is interested in the production of [[bile]] and the role of the liver in nutrition and regulating body functions.&lt;ref name=Everyman&gt;{{cite book |title=Everyman's Encyclopedia: Anatomy |last=Bozman |first=E. F. (ed.) |year=1967 |publisher=J. M. Dent &amp; Sons |asin=B0066E44EC |page=272 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discipline of anatomy can be subdivided into a number of branches including gross or [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] anatomy and [[Microscopic scale|microscopic]] anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/microscopic+anatomy |title=Anatomy |year=2007 |work=The Free Dictionary |publisher=Farlex |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gross anatomy]] is the study of structures that are large enough to be seen with the naked eye. It can be studied using both invasive and non-invasive methods with the goal of obtaining information about the structure and organization of organs and systems. Methods used include [[dissection]], in which the body is [[Surgery|surgically]] opened and its organs studied, and [[endoscopy]], in which a [[video camera]]-equipped instrument is inserted through a small incision in the body wall and used to explore the internal organs and other structures. [[Angiography]] is a proceeding in which blood vessels are visualized after being injected with an opaque dye, [[X-ray]]s and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] being used for this purpose.&lt;ref name=&quot;intro HGray&quot; /&gt; [[Microscopic anatomy]] is the study of structures on a microscopic scale, including [[histology]] (the study of tissues), and [[embryology]] (the study of the human organism in its immature condition).&lt;ref name=&quot;intro HGray&quot; /&gt;

The term &quot;anatomy&quot; is commonly taken to refer to [[human anatomy]]. However, substantially the same structures and tissues are found throughout the animal kingdom and the term also includes the anatomy of other animals. The structure and tissues of plants are of a dissimilar nature and they are studied in [[plant anatomy]].&lt;ref name=Everyman/&gt;

== History ==

{{main|History of anatomy}}

=== Ancient ===
In 1600 BCE, the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]], an Ancient Egyptian [[Medical manual|medical text]], described the [[heart]], its vessels, [[liver]], [[spleen]], [[kidneys]], [[hypothalamus]], [[uterus]] and [[Urinary bladder|bladder]], and showed the [[blood vessel]]s diverging from the heart. The [[Ebers Papyrus]] (c. 1550 BCE) features a &quot;treatise on the heart&quot;, with vessels carrying all the body's fluids to or from every member of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Greatest Benefit to Mankind: A Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present | last = Porter | first =  R. | year = 1997 | publisher = Harper Collins | isbn = 0-00-215173-1 | pages=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anatomy of the muscles and skeleton is described in the ''[[Hippocratic Corpus]]'', an Ancient Greek medical work written by unknown authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gillispie |first=Charles Coulston | authorlink=Charles Coulston Gillispie |title=Dictionary of Scientific Biography | volume=VI | pages=419–427 |year=1972 | publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] described [[vertebrate]] anatomy based on animal [[dissection]]. [[Praxagoras]] identified the difference between [[artery|arteries]] and [[vein]]s. Also in the 4th century BCE, [[Herophilos]] and [[Erasistratus]] produced more accurate anatomical descriptions based on [[vivisection]] of criminals in [[Alexandria]] during the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]].&lt;ref name=Bodies&gt;{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com.hk/books?id=5Xb9e3SLAZwC&amp;pg=PA256&amp;lpg=PA256&amp;dq=Ptolemaic+vivisection&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yNV56B5_Zt&amp;sig=bQhpGwQJYg6poB-8KTAjaMHeTH0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3-vwUeCzCYKEiAexnoHYBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Ptolemaic%20vivisection&amp;f=false | title=Medicine and Society in Ptolemaic Egypt |author=Lang, Philippa | publisher=Brill NV | year=2013 | page=256 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://exhibits.hsl.virginia.edu/antiqua/alexandrian/ &quot;Alexandrian Medicine&quot;]. ''Antiqua Medicina – from Homer to Vesalius''. University of Virginia.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2nd century [[Galen]], a Roman [[physician]], [[surgeon]] and [[Philosophy|philosopher]], wrote the final and highly influential anatomy treatise of ancient times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1081972/ | title=Galen on the Affected Parts | author=Galen | journal=Medical History |date=April 1977 | volume=21 | issue=2 | pages=212 |pmc=1081972}}&lt;/ref&gt; He compiled existing knowledge and studied organs through vivisection of animals.&lt;ref&gt;Brock, Arthur John Brock (translator), ''Introduction. Galen. On the Natural Faculties''. Edinburgh, 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; Galen's drawings, based mostly on dog anatomy, became effectively the only anatomical textbook for the next thousand years.&lt;ref name=Boas/&gt; His work was known to [[Renaissance]] doctors only through [[Islamic Golden Age]] medicine until it was translated from the Greek some time in the 15th century.&lt;ref name=Boas/&gt;

Between 1275 and 1326, the anatomists [[Mondino de Luzzi]], [[Alessandro Achillini]] and [[Antonio Benivieni]] at [[Bologna]] carried out the first systematic human dissections since ancient times.&lt;ref name=&quot;ZimmermanVeith1993&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zimmerman |first1=Leo M. |last2=Veith |first2=Ilza |title=Great Ideas in the History of Surgery |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ABbCI7z4UwMC |date=1 August 1993 |publisher=Norman |isbn=978-0-930-40553-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Crombie1959&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Crombie |first=Alistair Cameron |title=The History of Science From Augustine to Galileo |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bGDScHy1clsC&amp;pg=PA4 |year=1959 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |isbn=9780486288505}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thorndike1958&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Thorndike |first=Lynn |title=A History of Magic and Experimental Science: Fourteenth and fifteenth centuries|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IbvlQFj4YfUC&amp;pg=PA586 |year=1958 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=9780231087971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mondino's ''Anatomy'' of 1316 was the first textbook in the mediaeval rediscovery of human anatomy. It describes the body in the order followed in Mondino's dissections, starting with the abdomen, then the thorax, then the head and limbs. It was the standard anatomy textbook for the next century.&lt;ref name=Boas/&gt;

[[Andreas Vesalius]] (1514–1564) (Latinized from Andries van Wezel), professor of anatomy at the [[University of Padua]], is considered the founder of modern human anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/new_material_from/ |title=

''De humani corporis fabrica libri septem''. Basileae [Basel]: ''Ex officina'' Joannis Oporini, 1543.&lt;/ref&gt; The accurate and intricately detailed illustrations, often in [[allegory|allegorical]] poses against Italianate landscapes, are thought to have been made by the artist [[Jan van Calcar]], a pupil of [[Titian]].&lt;ref name=Boas&gt;{{cite book | title=The Scientific Renaissance 1450–1630 | publisher=Fontana | author=Boas, Marie | year=1970 (First published by Collins, 1962) | pages=120–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Malley, C.D. ''Andreas Vesalius of Brussels, 1514–1564''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) was trained in anatomy by [[Andrea del Verrocchio]].&lt;ref name=Boas/&gt; He made use of his anatomical knowledge in his artwork, making many sketches of skeletal structures, muscles and organs of humans and other vertebrates which he dissected.&lt;ref name=Boas/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Mason | first=Stephen F. | title=A History of the Sciences | publisher=Collier | year=1962 | location = New York | page=550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, anatomy was the subject of the first public lectures given in any science; these were given by the [[Barber surgeon|Company of Barbers and Surgeons]] in the 16th century, joined in 1583 by the Lumleian lectures in surgery at the [[Royal College of Physicians]].&lt;ref name=Boas229&gt;{{cite book | title=The Scientific Renaissance 1450–1630 | publisher=Fontana | author=Boas, Marie | year=1970 (First published by Collins, 1962) | page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Late modern ===
{{further2|[[History of anatomy in the 19th century]]}}
In the United States, medical schools began to be set up towards the end of the 18th century. Classes in anatomy needed a continual stream of cadavers for dissection and these were difficult to obtain. Philadelphia, Baltimore and New York were all renowned for [[body snatching]] activity as criminals raided graveyards at night, removing newly buried corpses from their coffins.&lt;ref name=trafficdead&gt;&lt;cite&gt;{{cite book |author=Sappol, Michael |title=A traffic of dead bodies: anatomy and embodied social identity in nineteenth-century America |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J. |year=2002 |isbn=0-691-05925-X |url=http://books.google.com/books/princeton?id=-9cKRzEx6ywC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+Traffic+of+Dead+Bodies}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar problem existed in Britain where demand for bodies became so great that grave-raiding and even [[anatomy murder]] were practised to obtain cadavers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosner, Lisa. 2010&quot;&gt;Rosner, Lisa. 2010.

University of Pennsylvania Press&lt;/ref&gt; Some graveyards were in consequence protected with watchtowers. The practice was halted in Britain by the [[Anatomy Act]] of 1832,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Death, Dissection, and the Destitute | publisher=Penguin | author=Richardson, Ruth | year=1989 | isbn=978-0-14022-862-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/chb/lectures/anatomy1.html | title=Introductory Anatomy | publisher=University of Leeds | accessdate=25 June 2013 | author=Johnson, D.R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in the United States, similar legislation was enacted after the physician [[William S. Forbes]] of [[Jefferson Medical College]] was found guilty in 1882 of &quot;complicity with resurrectionists in the despoliation of graves in Lebanon Cemetery&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jefferson.edu/about/eakins/forbes.html |title=Reproduction of Portrait of Professor William S. Forbes |publisher=Jefferson: Eakins Gallery  |accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teaching of anatomy in Britain was transformed by Sir [[John Struthers (anatomist)|John Struthers]], [[Regius Professor of Anatomy (Aberdeen)|Regius Professor of Anatomy]] at the [[University of Aberdeen]] from 1863 to 1889. He was responsible for setting up the system of three years of &quot;pre-clinical&quot; academic teaching in the sciences underlying medicine, including especially anatomy. This system lasted until the reform of medical training in 1993 and 2003. As well as teaching, he collected many vertebrate skeletons for his museum of [[comparative anatomy]], published over 70 research papers, and became famous for his public dissection of the [[Tay Whale]].&lt;ref name=pmid1717373426&gt;{{cite pmid|17373426}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15712576&quot;&gt;{{cite pmid|15712576}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1822 the Royal College of Surgeons regulated the teaching of anatomy in medical schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLachlan, J. 2006. p.243-53&quot;&gt;McLachlan, J. &amp; Patten, D. 2006.

The students came straight from watching cadavers being dissected direct to the bedsides of women in childbirth. Semmelweis showed that by the simple procedure of the trainees washing their hands, the incidence of [[puerperal fever]] among the mothers could be cut dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/534198/Ignaz-Philipp-Semmelweis |title=Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis |work=Encyclopædia Britannica  |accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MRI brain sagittal section.jpg|thumb|right|Sagittal [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scan of the head]]
Before the era of modern medical procedures, the main means for studying the internal structure of the body were [[palpation]] and [[dissection]]. It was the advent of [[microscopy]] that opened up an understanding of the building blocks that constituted living tissues. Technical advances in the development of [[achromatic lens]]es increased the [[Angular resolution|resolving power]] of the microscope and around 1839, [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann]] identified that cells were the fundamental unit of organization of all living things. Study of small structures involved passing light through them and the [[microtome]] was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine. Staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of cell. The fields of [[Cell biology|cytology]] and [[histology]] developed from here in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=BritMicro&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/22980/anatomy/283/Microscopic-anatomy |title=Microscopic anatomy |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of the [[electron microscope]] brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the [[ultrastructure]] of cells and the [[organelle]]s and other structures within them. About the same time, in the 1950s, the use of [[X-ray diffraction]] for studying the crystal structures of proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of [[molecular anatomy]].&lt;ref name=BritMicro/&gt;

Short wavelength electromagnetic radiation such as [[X-ray]]s can be passed through the body and are used in medical [[radiography]] to view interior structures which have different degrees of opaqueness. Nowadays, modern techniques such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]], [[X-ray computed tomography|computed tomography]], [[fluoroscopy]] and [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound imaging]] have enabled researchers and practitioners to examine organs, living or dead, in unprecedented detail. They are used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes and provide information on the internal structures and organs of the body to a degree far beyond the imagination of earlier generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mhhe.com/biosci/ap/foxhumphys/student/olc/h-reading1.html | title=Anatomical Imaging | publisher=McGraw Hill Higher Education | year=1998 | accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Animal tissues ==
The [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] [[Animalia]] contains multicellular organisms that are [[heterotroph]]ic and [[Motility|motile]] (although some have secondarily adopted a [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] lifestyle). Most animals have bodies differentiated into separate [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] and these animals are known as [[metazoa]]ns or [[eumetazoa]]ns. They have an internal [[digestion|digestive]] chamber, with one or two openings, the [[gamete]]s are produced in multicellular sex organs and the [[zygote]]s include a [[blastula]] stage in their [[Embryogenesis|embryonic development]]. Metazoans do not include the sponges, phylum [[Porifera]], or the [[Placozoa]]ns which have undifferentiated cells.&lt;ref name=Dorit549&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |pages=547–549 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal cells do not have a cell wall and do not contain [[chloroplast]]s. If a vacuole is present, it is smaller than that found in a plant cell. The body tissues are composed of a great variety of cells such as muscle, nerve and blood cells. Each typically has a cell membrane formed of [[phospholipid]]s, [[cytoplasm]] and a [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]]. Animal tissues can be grouped into four basic types: [[connective tissue|connective]], [[epithelium|epithelial]], [[muscle tissue|muscle]] and [[nervous tissue|nervous]]. Even the simplest invertebrates contain at least two types and body structures and organs of higher animals are formed from multiple tissue types.&lt;ref name=Ruppert60&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=81-315-0104-3 |pages=59–60 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Connective tissues are fibrous tissues and are made up of cells scattered among non-living material which is called the [[extracellular matrix]]. Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place. The main types are loose connective tissue, adipose tissue, fibrous connective tissue, blood, cartilage and bone. The extracellular matrix contains proteins, one of the commonest of which is [[collagen]], and plays an important part in organizing and maintaining tissues. The matrix can be modified to form a skeleton to support or protect the body. An [[exoskeleton]] is a thickened, rigid [[cuticle]] which is stiffened by mineralization, as in [[crustacean]]s or by the cross-linking of its proteins as in insects. An [[endoskeleton]] is internal and is present in all higher animals and many lower ones.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruppert60&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Skinlayers.png|thumb|left|Layers of epithelial cells in the epidermis]]
Epithelial tissue is composed of closely packed cells with little intercellular space. They can be [[Squamous epithelial cell|squamous]] (flat), [[Simple cuboidal epithelium|cuboidal]] or [[Columnar epithelial cell|columnar]] and rest on a [[basal lamina]], a membrane composed of extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells. The cells are bound closely to each other by [[cell adhesion molecule]]s. One or more layers of epithelial cells line the [[body cavities|cavities]] and surfaces of structures throughout the body including the external surface, the respiratory surface and the gut. The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix in the form of a cuticle. In simple animals this may just be a coat of [[glycoproteins]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruppert60&quot; /&gt; In more advanced animals, many [[gland]]s are formed of epithelial cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/kabernd/BerndCV/Lab/EpithelialInfoWeb/Glandular%20Epithelium.html |title=Glandular epithelium |author=Bernt, Karen |year=2010 |work=Epithelial Cells |publisher=Davidson College |accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Myocyte|Muscle cells]] (myocytes) form the active contractile tissue of the body. Muscle tissue functions to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs. Muscle is formed of contractile [[Myofibril|filaments]] and is separated into three types; [[Smooth muscle tissue|smooth muscle]], [[Skeletal striated muscle|skeletal muscle]] and obliquely striated muscle. Smooth muscle has no striations when examined microscopically. It contracts slowly but maintains contractibility over a wide range of stretch lengths. It is found in such organs as sea anemone tentacles and the body wall of sea cucumbers. Cross-striated muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension. It is found in the movement of appendages and jaws. Obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two. The filaments are staggered and this is the type of muscle found in [[earthworm]]s that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions.&lt;ref name=Ruppert103&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=81-315-0104-3 |page=103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets. Smooth muscle is found in the inner linings of organs and [[cardiac muscle]] is found in the [[heart]], allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body.

Nervous tissue is composed of many nerve cells known as [[neuron]]s which transmit information. In some slow-moving [[Symmetry in biology#Radial symmetry|radially symmetrical]] marine animals such as [[ctenophore]]s and [[cnidarian]]s (including [[sea anemone]]s and [[jellyfish]]), the nerves form a nerve net, but in most animals they are organized longitudinally into bundles. In simple animals, receptor neurons in the body wall cause a local reaction to a stimulus. In more complex animals, specialised receptor cells such as [[chemoreceptor]]s and [[photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]] are found in groups and send messages along neurons to other parts of the organism.

Human anatomy, including gross [[human anatomy]] and histology, is primarily the scientific study of the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of the adult human body. It differs from [[physiology]] in that anatomy is about the morphology of biological structures, while physiology is the way those structures actually work.&lt;ref name=&quot;intro HGray&quot; /&gt;

Generally, students of certain [[biology|biological sciences]], [[paramedic]]s, prosthetists and orthotists, [[physical therapy|physiotherapists]], [[occupational therapy|occupational therapists]], [[Nursing|nurses]], and [[medical school|medical students]] learn gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy from anatomical models, skeletons, textbooks, diagrams, photographs, lectures and tutorials, and in addition, medical students generally also learn gross anatomy through practical experience of [[dissection]] and inspection of [[cadaver]]s. The study of microscopic anatomy (or [[histology]]) can be aided by practical experience examining histological preparations (or slides) under a [[microscope]].

== Vertebrate anatomy ==
All vertebrates are built along the basic chordate [[body plan]]: a stiff rod running through the length of the animal ([[vertebral column]] or [[notochord]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Waggoner |first=Ben |title=Vertebrates: More on Morphology |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/vertebrates/vertmm.html |publisher=UCMP |accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a hollow tube of nervous tissue, the [[spinal cord]] above it and the [[gastrointestinal tract]] below. Nervous tissue is derived from the [[ectoderm]], connective tissues are derived from [[mesoderm]], and gut is derived from the [[endoderm]]. At the posterior end is a [[tail]] which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut. The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the [[anus]] at the base of the tail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Vertebrate Body |last=Romer |first=Alfred Sherwood |year=1985 |publisher=Holt Rinehart &amp; Winston |isbn=978-0030584466 |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column, in which the notochord has been replaced by a segmented series of stiffer elements ([[vertebra]]e) separated by mobile joints ([[intervertebral disc]]s), which each contain a soft central core ([[nucleus pulposus]]), derived from the notochord of the embryo. However, a few vertebrates have secondarily lost this anatomy, retaining the notochord into adulthood. These include the [[sturgeon]] and the [[coelacanth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Functional anatomy of the vertebrates: an evolutionary perspective|year=2001|publisher=Harcourt College Publishers|isbn=978-0-03-022369-3|author=Liem, Karel F.|author2=Warren Franklin Walker|page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gnathostomata|Jawed vertebrates]] are typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost. The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor. This is one of the arguments put forward by [[Charles Darwin]] to support his [[theory of evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/evolution/science/what-is-homology |title=What is Homology? |date=17 October 2008 |publisher=National Center for Science Education |accessdate=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fish anatomy ===
{{main|Fish anatomy}}
[[File:BLW Meyer's Butterfly Fish.jpg|thumb|left|Skeleton of a [[butterfly fish]] showing the [[vertebral column]] and fin rays]]
The body of a fish is divided into a head, trunk and tail, although the divisions between the three are not always externally visible. The skeleton, which forms the support structure inside the fish, is either made of [[cartilage]] (cartilaginous fish) or [[bone]] ([[bony fishes]]). The main skeletal element is the vertebral column, composed of articulating [[vertebra]]e which are lightweight yet strong. The ribs attach to the spine and there are no [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]] or limb girdles. The main external features of the fish, the [[fin]]s, are composed of bony spines and soft rays and, with the exception of the [[caudal fin]]s, have no direct connection with the spine. They are supported by the muscles which compose the main part of the trunk.&lt;ref name=Dorit818/&gt; The heart has two chambers and pumps the blood through the respiratory surfaces of the [[gill]]s and on round the body in a single circulatory loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C003758/Development/fish.htm |title=The fish heart |work=ThinkQuest |publisher=Oracle |accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eyes are adapted for seeing underwater and have only local vision. There is an inner ear but no external or [[middle ear]]. Low frequency vibrations are detected by the [[lateral line]] system on the flanks which responds to nearby movements and to changes in water pressure.&lt;ref name=Dorit818&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |pages=816–818 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharks and rays are [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] fish with numerous [[Primitive (phylogenetics)|primitive]] anatomical features similar to those of ancient fish, including skeletons composed of cartilage. Their bodies tend to be dorso-ventrally flattened, they usually have five pairs of gill slits and a large mouth set on the underside of the head. The dermis is covered with separate dermal [[Fish scale#Placoid scales|placoid scales]]. They have a [[cloaca]] into which the urinary and genital passages open, but not a [[swim bladder]]. Cartilaginous fish produce a small number of large, [[Egg yolk|yolky]] eggs. Some species are [[ovoviviparous]] and the young develop internally but others are [[oviparous]] and the larvae develop externally in egg cases.&lt;ref name=Kotpal&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Text Book of Zoology: Vertebrates |last=Kotpal |first=R. L. |last2= |first2= |year=2010 |publisher=Rastogi Publications |isbn=9788171338917 |page=193 |url=http://books.google.co.nz/books?id=U7N1j-8LMsEC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=%22origin+of+fins%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4vYeUeKWI9CgkgXUhIHYCQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22origin%20of%20fins%22&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bony fish lineage shows more [[Derived trait|derived]] anatomical traits, often with major evolutionary changes from the features of ancient fish. They have a bony skeleton, are generally laterally flattened, have five pairs of gills protected by an [[operculum (fish)|operculum]], and a mouth at or near the tip of the snout. The dermis is covered with overlapping [[Fish scale|scales]]. Bony fish have a swim bladder which helps them maintain a constant depth in the water column, but not a cloaca. They mostly [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]] a large number of small eggs with little yolk which they broadcast into the water column.&lt;ref name=Kotpal/&gt;

=== Amphibian anatomy ===
{{main|Amphibian anatomy}}
[[File:Ceratophrys cornuta skeleton front.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Frog skeleton|Skeleton of [[Surinam horned frog]]&lt;br&gt;(''Ceratophrys cornuta'')]]
[[Amphibian]]s are a [[Class (biology)|class]] of animals comprising frogs, [[salamander]]s and [[caecilian]]s. They are [[tetrapod]]s, but the caecilians and a few species of salamander have either no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their main bones are hollow and lightweight and are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other and have [[articular processes]]. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little [[keratin]] and lacks scales, but contains many [[mucous gland]]s and in some species, poison glands. The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two [[atrium (heart)|atria]] and one [[ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]. They have a [[urinary bladder]] and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as [[urea]]. Amphibians breathe by means of a pump action in which air is first drawn into the [[Buccopharyngeal membrane|buccopharyngeal]] region through the nostrils. These are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Natural History of Amphibians |last1=Stebbins |first1=Robert C. |last2=Cohen |first2=Nathan W. |year=1995 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-03281-5 |pages=24–25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They supplement this with [[gas exchange]] through the skin which needs to be kept moist.&lt;ref name=Dorit859&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |pages=843–859 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In frogs the pelvic girdle is robust and the hind legs are much longer and stronger than the forelimbs. The feet have four or five digits and the toes are often webbed for swimming or have suction pads for climbing. Frogs have large eyes and no tail. Salamanders resemble lizards in appearance; their short legs project sideways, the belly is close to or in contact with the ground and they have a long tail. Caecilians superficially resemble [[earthworm]]s and are limbless. They burrow by means of zones of muscle contractions which move along the body and they swim by undulating their body from side to side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Natural History of Amphibians |last1=Stebbins |first1=Robert C. |last2=Cohen |first2=Nathan W. |year=1995 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-03281-5 |pages=26–35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reptile anatomy ===
{{main|Reptile anatomy}}
[[File:SnakeSkelLyd.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Skeleton of a snake, drawn by [[Richard Lydekker]], 1896]]

Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, [[tuatara]]s, [[lizard]]s, snakes and [[Crocodilia|crocodiles]]. They are [[tetrapod]]s, but the snakes and a few species of [[Legless lizard|lizards]] either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system is designed for internal fertilisation, with a [[Sex organ|copulatory organ]] present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by [[Amniote|amniotic membranes]] which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or [[Ovoviviparity|develop internally]] in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as [[uric acid]].&lt;ref name=Dorit865&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |pages=861–865 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny [[carapace]] above and a [[plastron]] below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.&lt;ref name=Dorit868&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |pages=865–868 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the [[Triassic]] Period. There is one living species, ''[[Sphenodon punctatus]]''. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw and eventually wear down. The brain and heart are more primitive than is the case in other reptiles and the lungs have a single chamber and lack [[Bronchus|bronchi]]. The tuatara has a well-developed [[parietal eye]] on its forehead.&lt;ref name=Dorit868/&gt;

Lizards have skulls with only one [[Skull#Fenestrae|fenestra]] on each side, the lower bar of bone below the second fenestra having been lost. This results in the jaws being less rigidly attached which allows the mouth to open wider. Lizards are mostly quadrupeds, with the trunk held off the ground by short, sideways-facing legs, but a few species have no limbs and resemble snakes. Lizards have moveable eyelids, eardrums are present and some species have a central parietal eye.&lt;ref name=Dorit868/&gt;

Snakes are closely related to lizards, having branched off from a common ancestral lineage during the [[Cretaceous]] Period, and they share many of the same features. The skeleton consists of a skull, a hyoid bone, spine and ribs though a few species retain a vestige of the pelvis and rear limbs in the form of [[pelvic spur]]s. The bar under the second fenestra has also been lost and the jaws have extreme flexibility allowing the snake to swallow its prey whole. Snakes lack moveable eyelids, the eyes being covered by transparent &quot;spectacle&quot; scales. They do not have eardrums but can detect ground vibrations through the bones of their skull. Their forked tongues are used as organs of taste and smell and some species have sensory pits on their heads enabling them to locate warm-blooded prey.&lt;ref name=Dorit870&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |page=870 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crocodilians are large, low-slung aquatic reptiles with long snouts and large numbers of teeth. The head and trunk are dorso-ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed. It undulates from side to side to force the animal through the water when swimming. The tough keratinised scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull. The nostrils, eyes and ears are elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above the surface of the water when the animal is floating. Valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged. Unlike other reptiles, crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.&lt;ref name=Dorit874&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |page=874 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bird anatomy ===
{{main|Bird anatomy}}
[[File:AlcedoSkeleton.jpg|thumb|right|Skeleton of the [[Common Kingfisher]] (''Alcedo atthis'')]]
Birds are [[tetrapod]]s but though their hind limbs are used for walking or hopping, their front limbs are [[wing]]s covered with [[feather]]s and adapted for flight. Birds are [[endotherm]]ic, have a high [[metabolic rate]], a light [[Skeleton|skeletal system]] and powerful [[muscle]]s. The long bones are thin, hollow and very light. Air sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones. The sternum is wide and usually has a keel and the caudal vertebrae are fused. There are no teeth and the narrow jaws are adapted into a horn-covered beak. The eyes are relatively large, particularly in nocturnal species such as owls. They face forwards in predators and sideways in ducks.&lt;ref name=Dorit895&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |pages=881–895 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feathers are outgrowths of the [[epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]] and are found in localized bands from where they fan out over the skin. Large flight feathers are found on the wings and tail, contour feathers cover the bird's surface and fine down occurs on young birds and under the contour feathers of water birds. The only cutaneous gland is the single [[uropygial gland]] near the base of the tail. This produces an oily secretion that waterproofs the feathers when the bird [[personal grooming|preens]]. There are scales on the legs and feet and claws on the tips of the toes.&lt;ref name=Dorit895/&gt;

=== Mammal anatomy ===
{{Main|Mammal anatomy}}
[[File:Great Dane and Chihuahua Skeletons.jpg|thumb|left|Skeletons of a [[Great Dane]] and a [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]]]]
Mammals are a diverse class of animals, mostly terrestrial but some are aquatic and others have evolved flapping or gliding flight. They mostly have four limbs but some aquatic mammals have no limbs or limbs modified into fins and the forelimbs of bats are modified into wings. The legs of most mammals are situated below the trunk, which is held well clear of the ground. The bones of mammals are well ossified and their teeth, which are usually differentiated, are coated in a layer of [[Tooth enamel|prismatic enamel]]. The teeth are shed once ([[Deciduous teeth|milk teeth]]) during the animal's lifetime or not at all, as is the case in [[cetacea]]ns. Mammals have three bones in the middle ear and a [[cochlea]] in the [[inner ear]]. They are clothed in hair and their skin contains glands which secrete [[sweat gland|sweat]]. Some of these glands are specialised as [[mammary gland]]s, producing milk to feed the young. Mammals breathe with [[lung]]s and have a muscular [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs. The mammalian heart has four chambers and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely separate. Nitrogenous waste is excreted primarily as urea.&lt;ref name=Dorit914&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |pages=909–914 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mammals are [[amniote]]s, and most are [[Vivipary|viviparous]], giving birth to live young. The exception to this are the egg-laying [[monotreme]]s, the [[platypus]] and the [[echidna]]s of Australia. Most other mammals have a [[placenta]] through which the developing [[foetus]] obtains nourishment, but in [[marsupial]]s, the foetal stage is very short and the immature young is born and finds its way to its mother's [[Pouch (marsupial)|pouch]] where it latches on to a [[nipple]] and completes its development.&lt;ref name=Dorit914/&gt;

== Invertebrate anatomy ==
Invertebrates constitute a vast array of living organisms ranging from the simplest unicellular [[eukaryote]]s to such complex creatures as the octopus, lobster and dragonfly. By definition, none of them has a backbone. The cells of single-cell [[protozoa]]ns have the same basic structure as those of multicellular animals but some parts are specialised into the equivalent of tissues and organs. Locomotion is often provided by [[Cilium|cilia]] or [[Flagellum|flagella]] or may proceed via the advance of [[pseudopodia]], food may be gathered by [[phagocytosis]], energy needs may be supplied by [[photosynthesis]] and the cell may be supported by an [[endoskeleton]] or an [[exoskeleton]]. Some protozoans can form multicellular colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=81-315-0104-3 |pages=23–24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Metazoa]]ns are multicellular organism, different groups of cells of which have separate functions. The most basic types of metazoan tissues are epithelium and connective tissue, both of which are present in nearly all invertebrates. The outer surface of the epidermis is normally formed of epithelial cells and secretes an [[extracellular matrix]] which provides support to the organism. An endoskeleton derived from the [[mesoderm]] is present in [[echinoderm]]s, [[sponge]]s and some [[cephalopod]]s. [[Exoskeleton]]s are derived from the epidermis and is composed of [[chitin]] in [[arthropod]]s (insects, spiders, ticks, shrimps, crabs, lobsters). [[Calcium carbonate]] constitutes the shells of [[Mollusca|molluscs]], [[brachiopod]]s and some tube-building [[Polychaete|polychaete worms]] and [[silica]] forms the exoskeleton of the microscopic [[diatom]]s and [[radiolaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/198292/exoskeleton |title=Exoskeleton |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other invertebrates may have no rigid structures but the epidermis may secrete a variety of surface coatings such as the [[pinacoderm]] of sponges, the gelatinous cuticle of cnidarians ([[polyp]]s, [[sea anemone]]s, [[jellyfish]]) and the [[collagen]]ous cuticle of [[annelid]]s. The outer epithelial layer may include cells of several types including sensory cells, gland cells and stinging cells. There may also be protrusions such as [[Microvillus|microvilli]], cilia, bristles, [[Spine (zoology)|spines]] and [[tubercle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/289723/integument |title=Integument |author= Ebling, F.

=== Insect anatomy ===
{{main|Insect anatomy}}

Insects possess [[segmentation (biology)|segment]]ed bodies supported by a hard-jointed outer covering made mostly of chitin. The segments of the body are organized into three distinct parts, a head, a [[Thorax (insect anatomy)|thorax]] and an [[abdomen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=O. Orkin Insect zoo | url=http://insectzoo.msstate.edu/Students/basic.structure.html | year=1997 | publisher=Mississippi State University | accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The head typically bears a pair of sensory [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]], a pair of [[compound eye]]s, one to three simple eyes ([[ocelli]]) and three sets of modified appendages that form the [[insect mouthparts|mouthparts]]. The thorax has three pairs of segmented [[arthropod leg|legs]], one pair each for the three segments that compose the thorax and one or two pairs of [[insect wing|wings]]. The abdomen is composed of eleven segments, some of which may be fused and houses the [[digestion|digestive]], [[Respiration (physiology)|respiratory]], [[Excretion|excretory]] and reproductive systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gullan and Cranston&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Gullan |first=P.J. |last2=Cranston |first2=P.

'''Affirming the consequent''', sometimes called '''converse error''' or '''fallacy of the converse''', is a [[formal fallacy]] of inferring the [[converse (logic)|converse]] from the original statement. The corresponding argument has the general [[argument form|form]]:

#If ''P'', then ''Q''.
#''Q''.
#Therefore, ''P''.

An argument of this form is [[validity|invalid]], i.e., the conclusion can be false even when statements 1 and 2 are true.  Since ''P'' was never asserted as the ''only'' sufficient condition for ''Q'', other factors could account for ''Q'' (while ''P'' was false).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url = http://www.fallacyfiles.org/afthecon.html
 |title = Fallacy Files
 |work = http://www.fallacyfiles.org
 |publisher  = Fallacy Files
 |accessdate = 9 May 2013
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To put it differently, if ''P'' implies ''Q'', the '''only''' inference that can be made is ''non-Q'' implies ''non-P''.  (''Non-P'' and ''non-Q'' designate the opposite propositions to ''P'' and ''Q''.)  This is known as logical [[contraposition]]. Symbolically:

(''P'' ⇒ ''Q'') ⇔ (''non-Q'' ⇒ ''non-P'')

The name ''affirming the [[consequent]]'' derives from the premise ''Q'', which affirms the &quot;then&quot; clause of the [[indicative conditional|conditional]] premise.

==Examples==
One way to demonstrate the invalidity of this argument form is with a counterexample with true premises but an obviously false conclusion.  For example:

:If [[Bill Gates]] owns [[United States Bullion Depository|Fort Knox]], then he is [[Wealth|rich]].
:Bill Gates is rich.
:Therefore, Bill Gates owns Fort Knox.

Owning Fort Knox is not the ''only'' way to be rich.  Any number of other ways exist to be rich.

However, one can affirm with certainty that &quot;if Bill Gates is not rich&quot; (''non-Q'') then &quot;Bill Gates does not own Fort Knox&quot; (''non-P''). This is the [[contrapositive]] of the first statement, and it must be true if the original statement is true.

Arguments of the same form can sometimes seem superficially convincing, as in the following example:

:If I have the [[flu]], then I have a [[sore throat]].
:I have a sore throat.
:Therefore, I have the flu.

But having the flu is not the ''only'' cause of a sore throat since many illnesses cause sore throat, such as the [[common cold]] or [[strep throat]].

'''Andrei Arsenyevich Tarkovsky''' ({{lang-rus|Андре́й Арсе́ньевич Тарко́вский|p=ɐnˈdrʲej ɐrˈsʲenʲjɪvʲɪt͡ɕ tɐrˈkofskʲɪj}}; 4 April 1932 – 29 December 1986) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Russians|Russian]] film-maker, writer, film editor, [[film theory|film theorist]], theatre and opera director.

Tarkovsky's films include ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]'', ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'', ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'', ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|The Mirror]]'', and ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker]]''. He directed the first five of his seven feature films in the [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]]; his last two films, ''[[Nostalghia]]'', and ''[[The Sacrifice]]'', were produced in [[Cinema of Italy|Italy]] and [[Cinema of Sweden|Sweden]], respectively. His work is characterized by spirituality and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] themes, long takes, lack of conventional [[dramatic structure]], and distinctively authored use of cinematography. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest film-makers of all time. [[Ingmar Bergman]] said of Tarkovsky:&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Title quote of 2003 Tarkovsky Festival Program, Pacific Film Archive&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Tarkovsky for me is the greatest [director], the one who invented a new language, true to the nature of film, as it captures life as a reflection, life as a dream.}}

==Life==

===Childhood and early life===
Tarkovsky was born in the village of Zavrazhye in the [[Yuryevetsky District]] of the [[Ivanovo Industrial Oblast]] to poet and translator [[Arseny Tarkovsky|Arseny Alexandrovich Tarkovsky]], native of [[Yelisavetgrad|Kirovohrad]], [[Ukraine]]; and Maria Ivanova Vishnyakova, a graduate of the [[Maxim Gorky Literature Institute]]. Andrei's grandfather Aleksander Tarkowski was a [[Poles|Polish]] nobleman who worked as a bank clerk.

Tarkovsky spent his childhood in [[Yuryevets, Ivanovo Oblast|Yuryevets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Marina |last=Sipatova |title=Тайна рода Тарковских |work=[[Moskovskij Komsomolets]] |year=2007 |url=http://www.mk.ru/blogs/MK/2007/02/20/culture/92002 |language=Russian|accessdate=25 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was described by childhood friends as active and popular, having many friends and being typically in the center of action. In 1937, his father left the family, subsequently volunteering for the army in 1941. Tarkovsky stayed with his mother, moving with her and his sister Marina to Moscow, where she worked as a proofreader at a printing press. In 1939, Tarkovsky enrolled at the Moscow School № 554. During the war, the three evacuated to [[Yuryevets, Ivanovo Oblast|Yuryevets]], living with his maternal grandmother. In 1943, the family returned to Moscow. Tarkovsky continued his studies at his old school, where the poet [[Andrey Voznesensky]] was one of his class-mates. He studied piano at a music school and attended classes at an art school. The family lived on Shshipok Street in the [[Zamoskvorechye District]] in Moscow. From November 1947 to Spring 1948 he was in the hospital with [[tuberculosis]]. Many themes of his childhood – the evacuation, his mother and her two children, the withdrawn father, the time in the hospital – feature prominently in his film ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|The Mirror]]''.

Following high school graduation, from 1951 to 1952, Tarkovsky studied [[Arabic language|Arabic]] at the Oriental Institute in Moscow, a branch of the [[Academy of Sciences of the USSR]]. Although he already spoke some Arabic and was a successful student in his first semesters, he did not finish his studies and dropped out to work as a prospector for the Academy of Science Institute for Non-Ferrous Metals and Gold. He participated in a year-long research expedition to the river Kureikye near [[Turukhansk]] in the [[Krasnoyarsk Krai|Krasnoyarsk Province]]. During this time in the [[Taiga]] Tarkovsky decided to study film.

===Film school student===
Upon returning from the research expedition in 1954, Tarkovsky applied at the [[All-Union State Institute of Cinematography|State Institute of Cinematography]] (VGIK) and was admitted to the film directing program. He was in the same class as [[Irma Raush]] whom he married in April 1957.&lt;ref name=&quot;kompravda&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Anastasia | last=Pleshakova |title= Тарковский был &quot;разрешенным контрреволюционером&quot; |trans_title= Tarkovsky was &quot;a legal сounterrevolutionary&quot;| publisher= [[Komsomolskaya Pravda]] |date=4 April 2007 |url=http://www.kp.ru/daily/23881/65502/ |accessdate=27 November 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080104174327/http://www.kp.ru/daily/23881/65502/| archivedate= 4 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]] era offered unique opportunities for young film directors. Before 1953, annual film production was low and most films were directed by veteran directors. After 1953, more films were produced, many of them by young directors. The [[Khrushchev Thaw]] relaxed Soviet social restrictions a bit and permitted a limited influx of European and North American literature, films and music. This allowed Tarkovsky to see films of the [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealists]], [[French New Wave]], and of directors such as [[Akira Kurosawa|Kurosawa]], [[Luis Buñuel|Buñuel]], [[Ingmar Bergman|Bergman]], [[Robert Bresson|Bresson]], [[Andrzej Wajda]] (whose film ''[[Ashes and Diamonds (film)|Ashes and Diamonds]]'' was a true experience for him) and [[Kenji Mizoguchi|Mizoguchi]]. Tarkovsky absorbed the idea of the [[auteur theory|auteur]] as a necessary condition for creativity.

Tarkovsky's teacher and mentor was [[Mikhail Romm]], who taught many film students who would later become influential film directors. In 1956, Tarkovsky directed his first student short film, ''[[The Killers (1956 film)|The Killers]]'', from a short story of [[Ernest Hemingway]]. The short film ''[[There Will Be No Leave Today]]'' and the screenplay ''[[Concentrate (screenplay)|Concentrate]]'' followed in 1958 and 1959.

An important influence on Tarkovsky was the film director [[Grigori Chukhrai]], who was teaching at the V.G.I.K. Impressed by the talent of his student, Chukhrai offered Tarkovsky a position as assistant director for his film ''Clear Skies''. Tarkovsky initially showed interest but then decided to concentrate on his studies and his own projects.&lt;ref name=&quot;kompravda&quot; /&gt;

During his third year at the V.G.I.K., Tarkovsky met [[Andrei Konchalovsky]]. They found much in common as they liked the same film directors and shared ideas on cinema and films. In 1959, they wrote the script ''Antarctica – Distant Country'', which was later published in the ''[[Moskovskij Komsomolets]]''. Tarkovsky submitted the script to [[Lenfilm]], but it was rejected. They were more successful with the script ''[[The Steamroller and the Violin]]'', which they sold to [[Mosfilm]]. This became Tarkovsky's graduation project, earning him his diploma in 1960 and winning First Prize at the New York Student Film Festival in 1961.

==Career==

===Film career in the Soviet Union===
Tarkovsky's first feature film was ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]'' in 1962. He had inherited the film from director Eduard Abalov, who had to abort the project. The film earned Tarkovsky international acclaim and won the [[Golden Lion]] award at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in 1962. In the same year, on 30 September, his first son Arseny (called Senka in Tarkovsky's diaries) Tarkovsky was born.
[[File:Tarkovsky vgik.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Monument to Andrei Tarkovsky at entrance of [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography]]]]
In 1965, he directed the film ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'' about the life of [[Andrei Rublev]], the fifteenth-century Russian [[iconography|icon painter]]. ''Andrei Rublev'' was not immediately released after completion due to problems with Soviet authorities. Tarkovsky had to cut the film several times, resulting in several different versions of varying lengths. A version of the film was presented at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1969 and won the [[FIPRESCI|FIPRESCI prize]]. The film was officially released in the Soviet Union in a cut version in 1971.

He divorced his wife, [[Irma Raush]], in June 1970. In the same year, he married [[Larisa Tarkovskaya|Larissa Kizilova]] (née Egorkina), who had been a production assistant for the film ''Andrei Rublev'' (they had been living together since 1965). Their son, Andrei Andreyevich Tarkovsky, was born in the same year on 7 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Gianvito | first=John | title=Andrei Tarkovsky: Interviews ([[Conversations with Filmmakers Series]]) | year=2006 | publisher=University Press of Mississippi | location= | isbn=1-57806-220-9 | pages=XXV}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, he completed ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'', an adaptation of the novel ''[[Solaris (novel)|Solaris]]'' by [[Stanisław Lem]]. He had worked on this together with screen-writer Fridrikh Gorenshtein as early as 1968. The film was presented at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], won the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix Spécial du Jury]] and the [[FIPRESCI|FIPRESCI prize]], and was nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]]. From 1973 to 1974, he shot the film ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|The Mirror]]'', a highly autobiographical and unconventionally structured film drawing on his childhood and incorporating some of his father's poems. Tarkovsky had worked on the screenplay for this film since 1967, under the consecutive titles ''Confession'', ''White day'' and ''A white, white day''. From the beginning the film was not well received by Soviet authorities due to its content and its perceived elitist nature. Russian authorities placed the film in the &quot;third category,&quot; a severely limited distribution, and only allowed it to be shown in third-class cinemas and workers' clubs. Few prints were made and the film-makers received no returns. Third category films also placed the film-makers in danger of being accused of wasting public funds, which could have serious effects on their future productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Herbert. ''Sight and Sound''. Vol 45, no 2. Spring 1976. p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; These difficulties are presumed to have made Tarkovsky play with the idea of going abroad and producing a film outside the Soviet film industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|last=Tarkovsky |first=Andrei |author2=translated by Kitty Hunter-Blair |title=[[Time Within Time: The Diaries 1970-1986]] |publisher=Seagull Books |year=1991 |location=[[Calcutta]] |isbn=81-7046-083-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1975, Tarkovsky also worked on the screenplay ''[[Hoffmanniana]]'', about the German writer and poet [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]. In December 1976, he directed ''[[Hamlet]]'', his only stage play, at the [[Lenkom Theatre]] in Moscow. The main role was played by [[Anatoly Solonitsyn]], who also acted in several of Tarkovsky's films. At the end of 1978, he also wrote the screenplay ''Sardor'' together with the writer Aleksandr Misharin.

The last film Tarkovsky completed in the Soviet Union was ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker]]'', inspired by the novel ''[[Roadside Picnic]]'' by the brothers [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky]]. Tarkovsky had met the brothers first in 1971 and was in contact with them until his death in 1986. Initially he wanted to shoot a film based on their novel ''[[Dead Mountaineer's Hotel]]'' and he developed a raw script. Influenced by a discussion with Arkady Strugatsky he changed his plan and began to work on the script based on ''Roadside Picnic''. Work on this film began in 1976. The production was mired in troubles; improper development of the negatives had ruined all the exterior shots. Tarkovsky's relationship with cinematographer [[Georgy Rerberg]] deteriorated to the point where he hired [[Alexander Knyazhinsky]] as a new first cinematographer. Furthermore, Tarkovsky suffered a heart attack in April 1978, resulting in further delay. The film was completed in 1979 and won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].

In the same year Tarkovsky also began the production of the film ''The First Day'' (Russian: Первый День ''Pervyj Dyen′''), based on a script by his friend and long-term collaborator [[Andrei Konchalovsky]]. The film was set in 18th-century Russia during the reign of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] and starred [[Natalya Bondarchuk]] and [[Anatoli Papanov]]. To get the project approved by [[Goskino]], Tarkovsky submitted a script that was different from the original script, omitting several scenes that were critical of the [[Religion in the Soviet Union|official atheism in the Soviet Union]]. After shooting roughly half of the film the project was stopped by Goskino after it became apparent that the film differed from the script submitted to the censors. Tarkovsky was reportedly infuriated by this interruption and destroyed most of the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;{{cite book

===Film career outside the Soviet Union===
During the summer of 1979, Tarkovsky traveled to Italy, where he shot the documentary ''[[Voyage in Time]]'' together with his long-time friend [[Tonino Guerra]]. Tarkovsky returned to Italy in 1980 for an extended trip during which he and Guerra completed the script for the film ''[[Nostalghia]]''. During 1981 he traveled to the United Kingdom and Sweden. During his trip to Sweden he had considered defecting from the Soviet Union, but ultimately decided to return because of his wife and his son.

Tarkovsky returned to Italy in 1982 to start shooting ''[[Nostalghia]]''. He did not return to his home country. As [[Mosfilm]] withdrew from the project, he had to complete the film with financial support provided by the Italian [[RAI]]. Tarkovsky completed the film in 1983. ''[[Nostalghia]]'' was presented at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and won the [[FIPRESCI|FIPRESCI prize]] and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury. Tarkovsky also shared a special prize called ''Grand Prix du cinéma de creation'' with [[Robert Bresson]]. Soviet authorities prevented the film from winning the [[Palme d'Or]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Wagstaff2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book

He spent most of 1984 preparing the film ''[[The Sacrifice]]''. At a press conference in [[Milan]] on 10 July 1984, he announced that he would never return to the Soviet Union and would remain in Europe. At that time, his son Andrei Jr. was still in the Soviet Union and not allowed to leave the country.

During 1985, he shot the film ''[[The Sacrifice]]'' in Sweden. At the end of the year he was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. In January 1986, he began treatment in Paris and was joined there by his son, who was finally allowed to leave the Soviet Union. ''[[The Sacrifice]]'' was presented at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and received the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix Spécial du Jury]], the [[FIPRESCI|FIPRESCI prize]] and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury. As Tarkovsky was unable to attend due to his illness, the prizes were collected by his son, Andrei Jr.
[[Image:Gravestone of Andrei Tarkovsky 2007.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Andrei and Larisa Tarkovsky's grave, [[Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois Russian Cemetery]] in France]]
In Tarkovsky's last [[Time Within Time: The Diaries 1970-1986|diary]] entry (15 December 1986), he wrote: &quot;But now I have no strength left – that is the problem&quot;. The diaries are sometimes also known as ''[[Time Within Time: The Diaries 1970-1986|Martyrolog]]'' and were published posthumously in 1989 and in English in 1991.

Tarkovsky died in Paris on 29 December 1986. His funeral ceremony was held at the [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Paris|Alexander Nevsky Cathedral]]. He was buried on January third, 1987 in the [[Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois Russian Cemetery|Russian Cemetery]] in [[Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois, Essonne|Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois]] in France. The inscription on his gravestone, which was created by the Russian sculptor [[Ernst Neizvestny]], reads: ''To the man who saw the Angel''.

A controversy emerged in Russia in the early 1990s when it was alleged that Tarkovsky did not die of natural causes but was assassinated by the [[KGB]]. Evidence for this hypothesis includes testimonies by former KGB agents who claim that [[Viktor Chebrikov]] gave the order to eradicate Tarkovsky to curtail what the Soviet government and the KGB saw as [[anti-Soviet propaganda]] by Tarkovsky. Other evidence includes several memoranda that surfaced after the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|1991 coup]] and the claim by one of Tarkovsky's doctors that his cancer could not have developed from a natural cause.&lt;ref&gt;Komsolmoskaya Pravda, &quot;New Tarkovsky documents surface&quot;, 15. September 1995, page 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Tarkovsky, his wife [[Larisa Tarkovskaya]] and actor [[Anatoli Solonitsyn]] all died from the very same type of lung cancer, Vladimir Sharun, sound designer in ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker]]'', is convinced that they were all poisoned when shooting the film near a chemical plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tyrkin |first=Stas |title=In Stalker Tarkovsky foretold Chernobyl |journal=Komsomolskaya Pravda |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/Stalker/sharun.html |date=23 March 2001 |accessdate=9 September 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091009192507/http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/Stalker/sharun.html| archivedate= 9 October 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filmography===
{{main|Andrei Tarkovsky filmography}}
Tarkovsky is mainly known as a film director. During his career he directed only seven feature films, as well as three shorts from his time at V.G.I.K. He also wrote several screenplays. He furthermore directed the play ''[[Hamlet]]'' for the stage in Moscow, directed the opera ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'' in London, and he directed a radio production of the short story ''Turnabout'' by [[William Faulkner]]. He also wrote ''[[Sculpting in Time]]'', a book on film theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dialogue Talk&quot;&gt;[http://dialoguetalk.org/godfrey-reggio/sculpting-in-time/ &quot;Sculpting In Time&quot;] Dialogue Talk.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tarkovsky's first feature film was ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]'' in 1962. He then directed ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'' in 1966, ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'' in 1972, ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|The Mirror]]'' in 1975 and ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker]]'' in 1979. The documentary ''[[Voyage in Time]]'' was produced in Italy in 1982, as was ''[[Nostalghia]]'' in 1983. His last film ''[[The Sacrifice]]'' was produced in Sweden in 1986. Tarkovsky was personally involved in writing the screenplays for all his films, sometimes with a cowriter. Tarkovsky once said that a director who realizes somebody else's screenplay without being involved in it becomes a mere illustrator, resulting in dead and monotonous films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tarkovsky |first=Andrei |title=Lectures on Film Directing (notes from classes taught by Tarkovsky at the State Institute of Cinematography) |journal=Iskusstvo Kino |year=1990 |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/Directing.html |accessdate=14 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Illg |first=Jerzy |title=Z Andriejem Tarkowskim rozmawiają Jerzy Illg, Leonard Neuger |journal=Res Publica |volume=1 |pages=137–160 |location=Warsaw |year=1987 |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/interview.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===
{{main|List of awards won by Andrei Tarkovsky}}
Numerous awards were bestowed on Tarkovsky throughout his lifetime. At the [[Venice Film Festival]] he was awarded the [[Golden Lion]] for ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]''. At the [[Cannes Film Festival]], he won the [[FIPRESCI|FIPRESCI prize]] four times, the [[Prize of the Ecumenical Jury]] three times (more than any other director), and the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix Spécial du Jury]] twice. He was also nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]] two times. In 1987, the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] awarded the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film#1980s|BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] to ''[[The Sacrifice]]''.

Under the influence of [[Glasnost]] and [[Perestroika]], Tarkovsky was finally recognized in the Soviet Union in the Autumn of 1986, shortly before his death, by a retrospective of his films in Moscow. After his death, an entire issue of the film magazine ''Iskusstvo Kino'' was devoted to Tarkovsky. In their obituaries, the film committee of the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers of the USSR]] and the Union of Soviet Film Makers expressed their sorrow that Tarkovsky had to spend the last years of his life in exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Obituary |publisher=[[Literaturnaya Gazeta]] |date=7 January 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Posthumously, he was awarded the [[Lenin Prize]] in 1990, one of the highest state honors in the Soviet Union. In 1989 the ''Andrei Tarkovsky Memorial Prize'' was established, with its first recipient being the Russian animator [[Yuriy Norshteyn]]. Since 1993, the [[Moscow International Film Festival]] awards the annual ''Andrei Tarkovsky Award''. In 1996 the Andrei Tarkovsky Museum opened in [[Yuryevets, Ivanovo Oblast|Yuryevets]], his childhood town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=МУЗЕЙ А.ТАРКОВСКОГО |url=http://www.museum.ru/tarkovsky |accessdate=30 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[minor planet]], [[3345 Tarkovskij]], discovered by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] astronomer [[Lyudmila Georgievna Karachkina]] in 1982, has also been named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schmadel |first=Lutz |title=Dictionary of Minor Planet Names |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |url=http://books.google.com/books?q=3345+tarkovskij |isbn=3-540-00238-3 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tarkovsky has been the subject of several documentaries. Most notable is the 1988 documentary ''[[Moscow Elegy]]'', by Russian film director [[Alexander Sokurov]]. Sokurov's own work has been heavily influenced by Tarkovsky. The film consists mostly of narration over stock footage from Tarkovsky's films. ''Directed by Andrei Tarkovsky'' is 1988 documentary film by [[Michal Leszczylowski]], an editor of the film ''The Sacrifice''. Film director [[Chris Marker]] produced the television documentary ''[[One Day in the Life of Andrei Arsenevich]]'' as an homage to Andrei Tarkovsky in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Significant Documentaries |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheDocumentaries/Documentaries.html |accessdate=15 January 2008 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080115220027/http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheDocumentaries/Documentaries.html| archivedate= 15 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ingmar Bergman]] was quoted as saying: &quot;Tarkovsky for me is the greatest [of us all], the one who invented a new language, true to the nature of film, as it captures life as a reflection, life as a dream&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; Film historian [[Steven Dillon (writer and professor)|Steven Dillon]] claims that much of subsequent film was deeply influenced by the films of Tarkovsky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dillon|first=Steven|title=The Solaris Effect: Art and Artifice in Contemporary American Film|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-292-71345-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the entrance to the [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography]] in [[Moscow, Russia]] there is a monument that includes statues of Tarkovsky, [[Gennady Shpalikov]] and [[Vasily Shukshin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panoramio.com/photo/26383277 Panoramio – Photo of Monument to Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography famous learner – Gennady Shpalikov, Andrei Tarkovsky and Vasily Shukshin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Tarkovsky became a film director during the mid and late 1950s, a period referred to as the [[Khrushchev Thaw]], during which Soviet society opened to foreign films, literature and music, among other things. This allowed Tarkovsky to see films of European, American and Japanese directors, an experience which influenced his own film making. His teacher and mentor at the film school, [[Mikhail Romm]], allowed his students considerable freedom and emphasized the independence of the film director.

Tarkovsky was, according to Shavkat Abdusalmov, a fellow student at the film school, fascinated by Japanese films. He was amazed by how every character on the screen is exceptional and how everyday events such as a Samurai cutting bread with his sword are elevated to something special and put into the limelight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Abdusalamov |first=Shavkat |author2=translated by Sergei Sossinsky |title=Feedback Effects, in About Andrei Tarkovsky, Memoirs and Biographies |publisher=Progress Publishers |year=1990 |location=Moscow |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/On_Japanese_Influences.html |isbn=5-01-001973-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarkovsky has also expressed interest in the art of Haiku and its ability to create &quot;images in such a way that they mean nothing beyond themselves.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tarkovsky, Andrei. Sculpting in Time. Trans. Kitty Hunter-Blair. Austin, Texas: University of Texas Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Tarkovsky told film historian [[Leonid Kozlov]] his ten favorite films. The list includes: ''[[Diary of a Country Priest]]'' and ''[[Mouchette]]'', by [[Robert Bresson]]; ''[[Winter Light]]'', ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]'' and ''[[Persona (film)|Persona]]'', by [[Ingmar Bergman]]; ''[[Nazarín]]'', by [[Luis Buñuel]]; ''[[City Lights]]'', by [[Charlie Chaplin]]; ''[[Ugetsu]]'', by [[Kenji Mizoguchi]]; ''[[Seven Samurai]]'', by [[Akira Kurosawa]], and ''[[Woman in the Dunes]]'', by [[Hiroshi Teshigahara]]. Among his favorite directors were Buñuel, Mizoguchi, Bergman, Bresson, Kurosawa, [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], [[Jean Vigo]], and [[Carl Theodor Dreyer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lasica |first=Tom |title=Tarkovsky's Choice |journal=Sight and Sound |volume=3 |issue=3 |date=March 1993 |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/Tarkovsky-TopTen.html |accessdate=25 December 2007 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071121082212/http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/Tarkovsky-TopTen.html| archivedate= 21 November 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of ''City Lights'', the list does not contain any films of the early silent era. The reason is that Tarkovsky saw film as an art as only a relatively recent phenomenon, with the early film-making forming only a prelude. The list has also no films or directors from Tarkovsky's native Russia, although he rated Soviet directors such as [[Boris Barnet]], [[Sergei Paradjanov]] and [[Alexander Dovzhenko]] highly.

Although strongly opposed to commercial cinema, in a famous exception Tarkovsky praised the blockbuster film ''[[The Terminator]]'', saying its &quot;vision of the future and the relation between man and its destiny is pushing the frontier of cinema as an art&quot;. He was critical of the &quot;brutality and low acting skills&quot;, but nevertheless impressed by this film.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot; /&gt;

==Cinematic style==
Tarkovsky's films are characterized by [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] themes, extremely [[long take]]s, and memorable images of exceptional beauty. Recurring motifs are dreams, memory, childhood, running water accompanied by fire, rain indoors, reflections, levitation, and characters re-appearing in the foreground of long panning movements of the camera. He once said, “Juxtaposing a person with an environment that is boundless, collating him with a countless number of people passing by close to him and far away, relating a person to the whole world, that is the meaning of cinema.”

Tarkovsky included levitation scenes into several of his films, most notably ''Solaris''. To him these scenes possess great power and are used for their photogenic value and magical inexplicability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=de Brantes |first=Charles |title=La foi est la seule chose qui puisse sauver l'homme |newspaper=La France Catholique |date=20 June 1986 |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/AT_On.html |accessdate=14 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water, clouds, and reflections were used by him for their surreal beauty and photogenic value, as well as their symbolism, such as waves or the forms of brooks or running water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=English Programme Booklet for ''The Sacrifice'' |publisher=Swedish Film Institute |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/AT_For_Dummies.html |accessdate=14 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bells and candles are also frequent symbols. These are symbols of film, sight and sound, and Tarkovsky's film frequently has themes of self-reflection.

Tarkovsky developed a theory of cinema that he called &quot;sculpting in time&quot;. By this he meant that the unique characteristic of cinema as a medium was to take our experience of time and alter it. Unedited movie footage transcribes time in [[Real-time (media)|real time]]. By using long takes and few cuts in his films, he aimed to give the viewers a sense of time passing, time lost, and the relationship of one moment in time to another.

Up to, and including, his film ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|The Mirror]]'', Tarkovsky focused his cinematic works on exploring this theory. After ''The Mirror'', he announced that he would focus his work on exploring the [[dramatic unities]] proposed by [[Aristotle]]: a concentrated action, happening in one place, within the span of a single day.

Several of Tarkovsky's films have color or black and white sequences. This first occurs in the otherwise monochrome ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'', which features a color epilogue of [[Andrei Rublev|Rublev's]] authentic religious icon paintings. All of his films afterwards contain monochrome, and in ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker's]]'' case [[Sepia tone|sepia]] sequences, while otherwise being in color. In 1966, in an interview conducted shortly after finishing ''Andrei Rublev'', Tarkovsky dismissed color film as a &quot;commercial gimmick&quot; and cast doubt on the idea that contemporary films meaningfully use color. He claimed that in everyday life one does not consciously notice colors most of the time, and that color should therefore be used in film mainly to emphasize certain moments, but not all the time, as this distracts the viewer. To him, films in color were like moving paintings or photographs, which are too beautiful to be a realistic depiction of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chugunova |first=Maria |title=On Cinema – Interview with Tarkovsky |journal=To the Screen |date=December 1966 |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/On_Color.html |accessdate=14 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vadim Yusov===
Tarkovsky worked in close collaboration with cinematographer [[Vadim Yusov]] from 1958 to 1972, and much of the visual style of Tarkovsky's films can be attributed to this collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;List of Noted Film Director And Cinematographer Collaborations: Andrei Tarkovsky Vadim Yusov, Museum of Learning. [http://www.museumstuff.com/learn/topics/List_of_noted_film_director_and_cinematographer_collaborations::sub::Andrei_Tarkovsky_Vadim_Yusov]&lt;/ref&gt; Tarkovsky would spend two days preparing for Yusov to film a single long take, and due to the preparation, usually only a single take was needed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrei Tarkovsky p. 79&quot;&gt;The films of Andrei Tarkovsky: a visual fugue By Vida T. Johnson, Graham Petrie, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sven Nykvist===
In his last film, ''[[The Sacrifice]]'', Tarkovsky worked with cinematographer [[Sven Nykvist]], who had worked closely with director [[Ingmar Bergman]] on many of Ingmar Bergman's films – multiple people who worked with Bergman worked on the production, notably lead actor [[Erland Josephson]], who had acted for Tarkovsky in ''[[Nostalghia]]''. Nykvist complained that Tarkovsky would frequently look through the camera and even direct actors through it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrei Tarkovsky p. 79&quot;/&gt;

'''Ambiguity''' is an attribute of any concept, idea, statement or claim whose meaning, intention or interpretation cannot be definitively resolved according to a rule or process consisting of a finite number of steps.

The concept of ambiguity is generally contrasted with [[vagueness]]. In ambiguity, specific and distinct interpretations are permitted (although some may not be immediately apparent), whereas with information that is vague, it is difficult to form any interpretation at the desired level of specificity.

Context may play a role in resolving ambiguity. For example, the same piece of information may be ambiguous in one context and unambiguous in another.

== Linguistic forms ==
[[File:Structural analysis of an ambiguous spanish sentence.svg|thumb|Structural analysis of an ambiguous Spanish sentence:&lt;br&gt; '''Pepe vio a Pablo enfurecido''&lt;br&gt;Interpretation 1: When Pepe was angry, then he saw Pablo&lt;br&gt;Interpretation 2: Pepe saw that Pablo was angry.&lt;br&gt;Here, the syntactic tree in figure represents interpretation 2.]]

The [[Polysemy|lexical ambiguity]] of a word or phrase pertains to its having more than one meaning in the language to which the word belongs. &quot;Meaning&quot; here refers to whatever should be captured by a good dictionary. For instance, the word &quot;bank&quot; has several distinct lexical definitions, including &quot;[[Bank|financial institution]]&quot; and &quot;[[Bank (geography)|edge of a river]]&quot;. Another example is as in &quot;[[apothecary]]&quot;. One could say &quot;I bought herbs from the apothecary&quot;. This could mean one actually spoke to the apothecary ([[pharmacist]]) or went to the apothecary ([[pharmacy]]).

The context in which an ambiguous word is used often makes it evident which of the meanings is intended. If, for instance, someone says &quot;I buried $100 in the bank&quot;, most people would not think someone used a shovel to dig in the mud. However, some linguistic contexts do not provide sufficient information to disambiguate a used word. For example,

Lexical ambiguity can be addressed by algorithmic methods that automatically associate the appropriate meaning with a word in context, a task referred to as [[word sense disambiguation]].

The use of multi-defined words requires the author or speaker to clarify their context, and sometimes elaborate on their specific intended meaning (in which case, a less ambiguous term should have been used). The goal of clear concise communication is that the receiver(s) have no misunderstanding about what was meant to be conveyed. An exception to this could include a politician whose &quot;[[weasel word]]s&quot; and [[obfuscation]] are necessary to gain support from multiple [[Electoral district|constituents]] with [[mutually exclusive]] conflicting desires from their candidate of choice. Ambiguity is a powerful tool of [[political science]].

More problematic are words whose senses express closely related concepts. &quot;Good&quot;, for example, can mean &quot;useful&quot; or &quot;functional&quot; (''That's a good hammer''), &quot;exemplary&quot; (''She's a good student''), &quot;pleasing&quot; (''This is good soup''), &quot;moral&quot; (''a good person'' versus ''the lesson to be learned from a story''), &quot;[[righteous]]&quot;, etc. &quot; I have a good daughter&quot; is not clear about which sense is intended. The various ways to apply [[prefix]]es and [[suffix]]es can also create ambiguity (&quot;unlockable&quot; can mean &quot;capable of being unlocked&quot; or &quot;impossible to lock&quot;).

[[Syntactic ambiguity]] arises when a sentence can have two (or more) different meanings because of the structure of the sentence—its syntax.  This is often due to a modifying expression, such as a prepositional phrase, the application of which is unclear. &quot;He ate the cookies on the couch&quot;, for example, could mean that he ate those cookies that were on the couch (as opposed to those that were on the table), or it could mean that he was sitting on the couch when he ate the cookies.  &quot;To get in, you will need an entrance fee of $10 or your voucher and your drivers' license.&quot;  This could mean that you need EITHER ten dollars OR BOTH your voucher and your license.  Or it could mean that you need EITHER ten dollars OR a voucher AND you also need your license.  Only rewriting the sentence, or placing appropriate punctuation can resolve a syntactic ambiguity.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Critical Thinking, 10th ed., Ch 3, Moore, Brooke N. and Parker, Richard.  McGraw-Hill, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
For the notion of, and theoretic results about, syntactic ambiguity in artificial, [[formal languages]] (such as computer [[programming language]]s), see [[Ambiguous grammar]].

[[Spoken language]] can contain many more types of ambiguities, where there is more than one way to compose a set of sounds into words, for example &quot;ice cream&quot; and &quot;I scream&quot;. Such ambiguity is generally resolved according to the context. A mishearing of such, based on incorrectly resolved ambiguity, is called a [[mondegreen]].

[[Semantic ambiguity]] happens when a sentence contains an ambiguous word or phrase—a word or phrase that has more than one meaning.   In &quot;We saw her duck&quot; (example due to Richard Nordquist), the word &quot;duck&quot; can refer either
# to the person's bird (the noun &quot;duck&quot;, modified by the possessive pronoun &quot;her&quot;), or
# to a motion she made (the verb &quot;duck&quot;, the subject of which is the objective pronoun &quot;her&quot;, object of the verb &quot;saw&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

For example, &quot;You could do with a new automobile. How about a test drive?&quot; The clause &quot;You could do with&quot; presents a statement with such wide possible interpretation as to be essentially meaningless.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Lexical ambiguity is contrasted with semantic ambiguity. The former represents a choice between a finite number of known and meaningful context-dependent interpretations. The latter represents a choice between any number of possible interpretations, none of which may have a standard agreed-upon meaning. This form of ambiguity is closely related to [[vagueness]].

Linguistic ambiguity [[Ambiguity (law)|can be a problem in law]], because the interpretation of written documents and oral agreements is often of paramount importance.

==Intentional application==
[[Philosopher]]s (and other users of [[logic]]) spend a lot of time and effort searching for and removing (or intentionally adding) ambiguity in arguments, because it can lead to incorrect conclusions and can be used to deliberately conceal bad arguments. For example, a politician might say &quot;I oppose taxes which hinder economic growth&quot;, an example of a [[glittering generality]]. Some will think he opposes taxes in general, because they hinder economic growth. Others may think he opposes only those taxes that he believes will hinder economic growth. In writing, the sentence can be rewritten to reduce possible misinterpretation, either by adding a comma after &quot;taxes&quot; (to convey the first sense) or by changing &quot;which&quot; to &quot;that&quot; (to convey the second sense), or by rewriting it in other ways. The devious politician hopes that each [[Electoral district|constituent]] will interpret the statement in the most desirable way, and think the politician supports everyone's opinion. However, the opposite can also be true - An opponent can turn a positive statement into a bad one, if the speaker uses ambiguity (intentionally or not). The logical fallacies of [[amphiboly]] and [[equivocation]] rely heavily on the use of ambiguous words and phrases.

In [[Continental philosophy]] (particularly [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[existentialism]]), there is much greater tolerance of ambiguity, as it is generally seen as an integral part of the human condition. [[Martin Heidegger]] argued that the relation between the [[subject-object problem|subject and object]] is ambiguous, as is the relation of [[mind and body]], and [[mereology|part and whole]].&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, Martin. &quot;[[The Origin of the Work of Art]]&quot;. Poetry, Language, Thought. Trans. Albert Hofstadter. NY: Harper Collins, 1971, pg. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In Heidegger's phenomenology, [[Dasein]] is always in a meaningful world, but there is always an underlying background for every instance of signification. Thus, although some things may be certain, they have little to do with Dasein's sense of ''care'' and [[existential anxiety]], e.g., in the face of death. In calling his work [[Being and Nothingness]] an &quot;essay in phenomenological ontology&quot; [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] follows Heidegger in defining the human essence as ambiguous, or relating fundamentally to such ambiguity. [[Simone de Beauvoir]] tries to base an ethics on Heidegger's and Sartre's writings ([[The Ethics of Ambiguity]]), where she highlights the need to grapple with ambiguity: &quot;as long as philosophers and they [men] have thought, most of them have tried to mask it...And the ethics which they have proposed to their disciples has always pursued thre same goal. It has been a matter of eliminating the ambiguity by making oneself pure inwardness or pure externality, by escaping from the sensible world or being engulfed by it, by yielding to eternity or enclosing oneself in the pure moment.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;de Beauvoir, Simone. ''The Ethics of Ambiguity.'' Trans. Bernard Frechtman. New York: Citadel Press, 1976 [1948], pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethics cannot be based on the authoritative certainty given by mathematics and logic, or prescribed directly from the empirical findings of science. She states: &quot;Since we do not succeed in fleeing it, let us therefore try to look the truth in the face. Let us try to assume our fundamental ambiguity. It is in the knowledge of the genuine conditions of our life that we must draw our strength to live and our reason for acting&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;de Beauvoir, ''Ethics,'' pg. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Other continental philosophers suggest that concepts such as life, nature, and sex are ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. ''The History of Sexuality, An Introduction (Vol. 1). Trans Robert Hurley. New York: Vintage Books, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, Corey Anton has argued that we cannot be certain what is separate from or unified with something else: language, he asserts, divides what is not in fact separate.&lt;ref&gt;Anton, Corey. ''Sources of Significance: Worldly Rejuvenation and Neo-Stoic Heroism.'' West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 2010, pg. 35-63.&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Ernest Becker]], he argues that the desire to 'authoritatively disambiguate' the world and existence has led to numerous [[ideologies]] and historical events such as [[genocide]]. On this basis, he argues that ethics must focus on 'dialectically integrating opposites' and balancing tension, rather than seeking a priori validation or certainty. Like the existentialists and phenomenologists, he sees the ambiguity of life as the basis of creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Anton |last=Corey |title= Authoritative Disambiguation |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxNR3aOL8l4 |work= Professoranton, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[literature]] and [[rhetoric]], ambiguity can be a useful tool. [[Groucho Marx]]'s classic joke depends on a grammatical ambiguity for its [[humor]], for example: &quot;Last night I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got in my pajamas, I'll never know&quot;. Songs and poetry often rely on ambiguous words for artistic effect, as in the song title &quot;Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue&quot; (where &quot;blue&quot; can refer to the color, or to [[sadness]]).

In narrative, ambiguity can be introduced in several ways: motive, plot, character. [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] uses the latter type of ambiguity with notable effect in his novel ''[[The Great Gatsby]]''.

All [[religions]] debate the [[orthodoxy]] or [[heterodoxy]] of ambiguity.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]] employ the concept of [[paradox]] synonymously with 'ambiguity'. Ambiguity within Christianity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rowland Croucher |url=http://jmm.aaa.net.au/articles/9018.htm |title=Living With Ambiguity |publisher=Jmm.aaa.net.au |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and other religions) is resisted by the conservatives and fundamentalists, who regard the concept as equating with 'contradiction'. Non-fundamentalist Christians and Jews endorse [[Rudolf Otto]]'s description of the sacred as 'mysterium tremendum et fascinans', the awe-inspiring mystery which fascinates humans.{{Dubious|date=July 2012|reason=Entire paragraph of doubtful validity}}

[[Metonymy]] involves the use of the name of a subcomponent part as an abbreviation, or [[jargon]], for the name of the whole object (for example &quot;wheels&quot; to refer to a car, or &quot;flowers&quot; to refer to beautiful offspring, an entire plant, or a collection of blooming plants). In modern [[vocabulary]] critical [[semiotics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/epc/srb/cyber/sim8.html |title=CSI: Sim8 |publisher=Chass.utoronto.ca |date=1942-11-14 |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; metonymy encompasses any potentially ambiguous word substitution that is based on contextual [[contiguity]] (located close together), or a function or process that an object performs, such as &quot;sweet ride&quot; to refer to a nice car. Metonym miscommunication is considered a primary mechanism of linguistic humour.&lt;ref&gt;Veale, Tony (2003): &quot;Metaphor and Metonymy: The Cognitive Trump-Cards of Linguistic Humor&quot;[http://afflatus.ucd.ie/Papers/iclc2003.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychology and management===
In sociology and social psychology, the term &quot;ambiguity&quot; is used to indicate situations that involve [[uncertainty]]. An increasing amount of research is concentrating on how people react and respond to ambiguous situations. Much of this focuses on [[ambiguity tolerance]]. A number of correlations have been found between an individual's reaction and tolerance to ambiguity and a range of factors.

Apter and Desselles (2001)&lt;ref&gt;in Motivational Styles in Everyday life: A guide to reversal Theory. M.J. Apter (ed) (2001) APA Books&lt;/ref&gt; for example, found a strong correlation with such attributes and factors like a greater preference for safe as opposed to risk-based sports, a preference for endurance-type activities as opposed to explosive activities, a more organized and less casual lifestyle, greater care and precision in descriptions, a lower sensitivity to emotional and unpleasant words, a less acute sense of humor, engaging a smaller variety of sexual practices than their more risk-comfortable colleagues, a lower likelihood of the use of drugs, pornography and drink, a greater likelihood of displaying obsessional behavior.

In the field of [[leadership]], [[David Wilkinson (ambiguity expert)|David Wilkinson]] (2006)&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, D.J. (2006) ''The Ambiguity Advantage: What great leaders are great at''. New York Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; found strong correlations between an individual leader's reaction to ambiguous situations and the [[Modes of Leadership]] they use, the type of [[creativity]], Kirton (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Kirton, M.J. (2003)Adaption-Innovation: In the Context of Diversity and Change. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; and how they relate to others.

==Music==
In [[music]], pieces or sections which confound expectations and may be or are interpreted simultaneously in different ways are ambiguous, such as some [[polytonality]], [[polymeter]], other ambiguous [[metre|meters]] or [[rhythm]]s, and ambiguous [[phrase (music)|phrasing]], or (Stein 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;79) any [[aspect of music]]. The [[music of Africa]] is often purposely ambiguous. To quote [[Donald Francis Tovey|Sir Donald Francis Tovey]] (1935, p.&amp;nbsp;195), &quot;Theorists are apt to vex themselves with vain efforts to remove uncertainty just where it has a high aesthetic value.&quot;

== Visual art ==
[[File:Necker cube.svg|The [[Necker cube]], an ambiguous image|thumb]]
In visual art, certain images are visually ambiguous, such as the [[Necker cube]], which can be interpreted in two ways. Perceptions of such objects remain stable for a time, then may flip, a phenomenon called [[multistable perception]].
The opposite of such ambiguous images are [[impossible object]]s.

Pictures or photographs may also be ambiguous at the semantic level: the visual image is unambiguous, but the meaning and narrative may be ambiguous: is a certain facial expression one of excitement or fear, for instance?

==Constructed language==
Some [[Constructed language|languages have been created]] with the intention of avoiding ambiguity, especially [[Polysemy|lexical ambiguity]]. [[Lojban]] and [[Loglan]] are two related languages which have been created with this in mind, focusing chiefly on syntactic ambiguity as well. The languages can be both spoken and written. These languages are intended to provide a greater technical precision over big natural languages, although historically, such attempts at language improvement have been criticized. Languages composed from many diverse sources contain much ambiguity and inconsistency. The many exceptions to [[syntax]] and [[semantic]] rules are time-consuming and difficult to learn.

==Mathematical notation==
[[Mathematical notation]], widely used in [[physics]] and other [[science]]s, avoids many ambiguities compared to expression in natural language. However, for various reasons, several [[Lexical (semiotics)|lexical]], [[syntactic]] and [[semantic]] ambiguities remain.

===Names of functions===
The '''ambiguity''' in the style of writing a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] should not be confused with a [[multivalued function]], which can (and should) be defined in a deterministic and unambiguous way. Several [[special function]]s still do not have established notations. Usually, the conversion to another notation requires to scale the argument and/or the resulting value; sometimes, the same name of the function is used, causing confusions. Examples of such underestablished functions:
* [[Sinc function]]
* [[Elliptic integral#Complete elliptic integral of the third kind|Elliptic integral of the third kind]]; translating elliptic integral form [[MAPLE]] to [[Mathematica]], one should replace the second argument to its square, see [[Talk:Elliptic integral#List of notations]]; dealing with complex values, this may cause problems.
* [[Exponential integral]],&lt;ref name=&quot;irene&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first1=M. |last1=Abramovits |first2=I. |last2=Stegun |title=Handbook on mathematical functions |page= 228 |url=http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_228.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hermite polynomial]],&lt;ref name=&quot;irene&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first1=M. |last1=Abramovits |first2=I. |last2=Stegun |title=Handbook on mathematical functions |page= 775 |url=http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_775.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expressions===
Ambiguous expressions often appear in physical and mathematical texts.
It is common practice to omit multiplication signs in mathematical expressions. Also, it is common to give the same name to a variable and a function, for example, &lt;math&gt;f=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Then, if one sees &lt;math&gt;f=f(y+1)&lt;/math&gt;, there is no way to distinguish whether it means &lt;math&gt;f=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; '''multiplied''' by &lt;math&gt;(y+1)&lt;/math&gt;, or function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; '''evaluated''' at argument equal to &lt;math&gt;(y+1)&lt;/math&gt;. In each case of use of such notations, the reader is supposed to be able to perform the deduction and reveal the true meaning.

Creators of algorithmic languages try to avoid ambiguities. Many algorithmic languages ([[C++]] and [[Fortran]]) require the character * as symbol of multiplication. The language [[Mathematica]] allows the user to omit the multiplication symbol, but requires square brackets to indicate the argument of a function; square brackets are not allowed for grouping of expressions. Fortran, in addition, does not allow use of the same name (identifier) for different objects, for example, function and variable; in particular, the expression '''f=f(x)''' is qualified as an error.

The order of operations may depend on the context. In most [[programming language]]s, the operations of division and multiplication have equal priority and are executed from left to right. Until the last century, many editorials assumed that multiplication is performed first, for example, &lt;math&gt;a/bc&lt;/math&gt; is interpreted as &lt;math&gt;a/(bc)&lt;/math&gt;; in this case, the insertion of parentheses is required when translating the formulas to an algorithmic language. In addition, it is common to write an argument of a function without parenthesis, which also may lead to ambiguity.
Sometimes, one uses ''italics'' letters to denote elementary functions.
In the [[scientific journal]] style, the expression
&lt;math&gt; s i n \alpha&lt;/math&gt;
means
product of variables
&lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, although in a slideshow, it may mean &lt;math&gt;\sin[\alpha]&lt;/math&gt;.

A comma in subscripts and superscripts sometimes is omitted; it is also ambiguous notation.
If it is written &lt;math&gt;T_{mnk}&lt;/math&gt;, the reader should guess from the context, does it mean a single-index object, evaluated while the subscript is equal to product of variables
&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, or it is indication to a trivalent tensor.
The writing of &lt;math&gt;T_{mnk}&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;T_{m,n,k}&lt;/math&gt; may mean that the writer either is stretched in space (for example, to reduce the publication fees) or aims to increase number of publications without considering readers. The same may apply to any other use of ambiguous notations.

Subscripts are also used to denote the argument to a function, as in &lt;math&gt;F_{x}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;!--
Some scientific journals use superscripts to indicate citations. If one cites reference number 6 about [[coherent addition of lasers]], the centenve may read as follows:
Practically, the number of lasers, which can be combined in such a way, does not exceed 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.
&quot;Oh, this very powerful method allows for the combination of a million lasers,&quot;
the reader may think. To avoid such ambiguitty, [[citations]] in Wikipedia appear inside square bracket &lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;.
!--&gt;

===Examples of potentially confusing ambiguous mathematical expressions ===
&lt;math&gt;\sin^2\alpha/2\,&lt;/math&gt;, which could be understood to mean either &lt;math&gt;(\sin(\alpha/2))^2\,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(\sin(\alpha))^2/2\,&lt;/math&gt;. In addition, &lt;math&gt;\sin^2(x)&lt;/math&gt; may mean &lt;math&gt;\sin(\sin(x))&lt;/math&gt;, as &lt;math&gt;\exp^2(x)&lt;/math&gt; means &lt;math&gt;\exp(\exp(x))&lt;/math&gt; (see [[tetration]]).

&lt;math&gt;\sin^{-1}\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, which by convention means &lt;math&gt;\arcsin(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;, though it might be thought to mean &lt;math&gt;(\sin(\alpha))^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;\sin^{n} \alpha&lt;/math&gt; means &lt;math&gt;(\sin(\alpha))^{n}\,&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;a/2b\,&lt;/math&gt;, which arguably should mean &lt;math&gt;(a/2)b\,&lt;/math&gt; but would commonly be understood to mean &lt;math&gt;a/(2b)\,&lt;/math&gt; .

===Notations in quantum optics and quantum mechanics===
It is common to define the [[coherent states]] in [[quantum optics]] with &lt;math&gt;~|\alpha\rangle~ &lt;/math&gt; and states with fixed number of photons with &lt;math&gt;~|n\rangle~&lt;/math&gt;. Then, there is an &quot;unwritten rule&quot;: the state is coherent if there are more Greek characters than Latin characters in the argument, and &lt;math&gt;~n~&lt;/math&gt;photon state if the Latin characters dominate. The ambiguity becomes even worse, if &lt;math&gt;~|x\rangle~&lt;/math&gt; is used for the states with certain value of the coordinate, and &lt;math&gt;~|p\rangle~&lt;/math&gt; means the state with certain value of the momentum, which may be used in books on [[quantum mechanics]]. Such ambiguities easy lead to confusions, especially if some normalized [[adimensional]], [[dimensionless]] variables are used. Expression &lt;math&gt; |1\rangle &lt;/math&gt; may mean a state with single photon, or the coherent state with mean amplitude equal to 1, or state with momentum equal to unity, and so on. The reader is supposed to guess from the context.

===Ambiguous terms in physics and mathematics===
Some physical quantities do not yet have established notations; their value (and sometimes even [[dimension]], as in the case of the [[Einstein coefficients]]), depends on the system of notations. Many terms are ambiguous. Each use of an ambiguous term should be preceded by the definition, suitable for a specific case. Just like [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] states in [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]: &quot;... Only in the context of a proposition has a name meaning.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wittgenstein |first=Ludwig |title=Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus |page=39 |publisher=Dover Publications Inc. |year=1999 |isbn=0-486-40445-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A highly confusing term is ''[[gain]]''. For example, the sentence &quot;the gain of a system should be doubled&quot;, without context, means close to nothing.&lt;br /&gt;
It may mean that the ratio of the output voltage of an electric circuit to the input voltage should be doubled.&lt;br /&gt;
It may mean that the ratio of the output power of an electric or optical circuit to the input power should be doubled.&lt;br /&gt;
It may mean that the gain of the laser medium should be doubled, for example, doubling the population of the upper laser level in a quasi-two level system (assuming negligible absorption of the ground-state).

The term ''intensity'' is ambiguous when applied to light. The term can refer to any of [[irradiance]], [[luminous intensity]], [[radiant intensity]], or [[radiance]], depending on the background of the person using the term.

Also, confusions may be related with the use of [[atomic percent]] as measure of concentration of a [[dopant]], or [[Optical resolution|resolution]] of an imaging system, as measure of the size of the smallest detail which still can be resolved at the background of statistical noise. See also [[Accuracy and precision]] and its talk.

The [[Berry paradox]] arises as a result of systematic ambiguity in the meaning of terms such as &quot;definable&quot; or &quot;nameable&quot;. Terms of this kind give rise to [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious circle]] fallacies. Other terms with this type of ambiguity are: satisfiable, true, false, function, property, class, relation, cardinal, and ordinal.&lt;ref&gt;Russell/Whitehead, Principia Mathematica&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical interpretation of ambiguity==
[[File:Necker cube and impossible cube.svg|The [[Necker cube]] and [[impossible cube]], an underdetermined and overdetermined object, respectively.|thumb]]
In mathematics and logic, ambiguity can be considered to be an ''underdetermined system'' (of equations or logic) – for example, &lt;math&gt;X=Y&lt;/math&gt; leaves open what the value of ''X'' is – while its opposite is a [[self-contradiction]], also called [[inconsistency]], [[paradoxicalness]], or [[oxymoron]], in an [[overdetermined system]] – such as &lt;math&gt;X=2, X=3&lt;/math&gt;, which has no solution – see also [[underdetermination]].

Logical ambiguity and self-contradiction is analogous to visual ambiguity and [[impossible object]]s, such as the Necker cube and impossible cube, or many of the drawings of [[M. C. Escher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pedagogic use of ambiguous expressions==
Ambiguity can be used as a pedagogical trick, to force students to reproduce the deduction by themselves. Some textbooks&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |first1=H. |last1=Haug |first2=S. |last2=Koch |title=Quantum Theory of the Optical and Electronic Properties of Semiconductors |url=http://www.allbookstores.com/book/9812387560}}&lt;/ref&gt;
give the same name to the function and to its [[Fourier transform]]:
:&lt;math&gt;~f(\omega)=\int f(t) \exp(i\omega t) {\rm d}t &lt;/math&gt;.
Rigorously speaking, such an expression requires that &lt;math&gt;~ f=0 ~&lt;/math&gt;;
even if function &lt;math&gt;~ f ~&lt;/math&gt; is a [[self-Fourier function]], the expression should be written as
&lt;math&gt;~f(\omega)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int f(t) \exp(i\omega t) {\rm d}t &lt;/math&gt;; however, '''it is assumed that
the shape of the function ''' (and even its norm
&lt;math&gt;\int |f(x)|^2 {\rm d}x &lt;/math&gt;) '''depend on the character used to denote its argument'''.
If the Greek letter is used, it is assumed to be a Fourier transform of another function,
The first function is assumed, if the expression in the argument contains more characters &lt;math&gt;~t~&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;~\tau~&lt;/math&gt;, than characters &lt;math&gt;~\omega~&lt;/math&gt;, and the second function is assumed in the opposite case. Expressions like &lt;math&gt;~f(\omega t)~&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;~f(y)~&lt;/math&gt; contain symbols &lt;math&gt;~t~&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;~\omega~&lt;/math&gt; in equal amounts; they are ambiguous and should be avoided in serious deduction.

The '''aardvark''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑː|r|d|.|v|ɑː|r|k|}} {{respell|ARD|vark}}, ''Orycteropus afer'') is a medium-sized, burrowing, [[nocturnal]] mammal native to [[Africa]].&lt;ref name=EB&gt;Hoiberg, Dale H. (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only living species of the order [[Tubulidentata]],&lt;ref name=&quot;MSW3&quot;&gt;Schlitter, D. A. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; although other prehistoric species and genera of Tubulidentata are known.

==Naming and taxonomy==
It is sometimes colloquially called &quot;African antbear&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Colliers&quot;&gt;Goodwin, George G. (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craddock, et al. (2011){{title?}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[anteater]]&quot;, or the &quot;Cape anteater&quot;&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; after the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. The name comes from earlier [[Afrikaans]] (erdvark)&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; and means &quot;earth [[pig]]&quot; or &quot;ground pig&quot; (''aarde'' earth/ground, ''vark'' pig), because of its burrowing habits&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; (similar origin to the name [[groundhog]]). The aardvark is not closely related to the pig; rather, it is the sole recent representative of the obscure mammalian [[order (biology)|order]] [[Tubulidentata]], in which it is usually considered to form one variable species of the genus ''[[Orycteropus]]'', the sole surviving genus in the family [[Orycteropodidae]]. The aardvark is not closely related to the [[South America]]n [[anteater]], despite sharing some characteristics and a superficial resemblance.&lt;ref name=awf/&gt; The similarites are based on [[convergent evolution]].&lt;ref name=UR2/&gt; The closest living relatives of the aardvark are the [[elephant shrew]]s, along with the [[sirenian]]s, [[hyrax]]es, [[tenrecidae|tenrec]]s, and [[elephant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez, Tommy (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; With their extinct relatives, these animals form the superorder [[Afrotheria]].&lt;ref name=UR&gt;Rahm, Urs (1990); pp.450-451&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of the brain have shown the similarities with [[Condylarthra]].&lt;ref name=UR2/&gt; The scientific name of the aardvark comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] ορυκτερόπους (''orykterópous'') meaning &quot;digging footed&quot; and [[wikt:Afer|afer]]: from Africa.

Based on fossils, Bryan Patterson has concluded that early relatives of the aardvark appeared in [[Africa]] around the end of the [[Paleocene]].&lt;ref name=UR2/&gt; ''[[Plesiorycteropus]]'', from [[Madagascar]] separated itself early on, probably during the [[Eocene]]. The first known tubulidentate was probably ''[[Myorycteropus africanus]]'' from [[Kenya]]n [[Miocene]] deposits.&lt;ref name=UR2/&gt; The earliest example from the ''[[Orycteropus]]'' genus was the ''[[Orycteropus mauritanicus]]'' found in [[Algeria]] in deposits from the middle Miocene, with an equally aged version found in Kenya.&lt;ref name=UR2/&gt; Fossils from the aardvark have been dated to 5 million years, and have been located throughout [[Europe]] and the [[Near East]].&lt;ref name=UR2/&gt; A close relative lived in Madagascar during the [[last ice age]].&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Aardvark skeleton mount.JPG|thumb|left|An aardvark skeleton and mounted specimen at the Natural History Museum of Genoa]]
The aardvark is vaguely pig-like in appearance. Its body is stout with a prominently arched back&lt;ref name=UR1&gt;Rahm, Urs (1990); p. 452&lt;/ref&gt; and is sparsely covered with coarse hairs. The limbs are of moderate length, with the rear legs being longer than the forelegs.&lt;ref name=UR/&gt; The front feet have lost the pollex (or 'thumb'), resulting in four toes, while the rear feet have all five toes. Each toe bears a large, robust [[Nail (anatomy)|nail]] which is somewhat flattened and shovel-like, and appears to be intermediate between a [[claw]] and a hoof. Whereas the aardvark is considered [[digitigrade]], it appears at time to be [[plantigrade]]. This confusion happens because when it squats it stands on its soles.&lt;ref name=UR1/&gt;

An aardvark's weight is typically between {{convert|60|and(-)|80|kg}}.&lt;ref name=UR/&gt; An aardvark's length is usually between {{convert|105|and(-)|130|cm|ft}},&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; and can reach lengths of {{convert|2.2|m}} when its tail (which can be up to {{convert|70|cm}}) is taken into account. It is {{convert|60|cm|in}} tall at the shoulder, and has a girth of about {{convert|100|cm|ft}}.&lt;ref name=UR1/&gt; It is the [[Largest organisms|largest]] member of the proposed clade [[Afroinsectiphilia]]. The aardvark is pale yellowish-gray in color and often stained reddish-brown by [[soil]]. The aardvark's coat is thin, and the animal's primary protection is its tough skin. Its hair is short on its head and tail; however its legs tend to have longer hair.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; The hair on the majority of its body is grouped in clusters of 3-4 hairs.&lt;ref name=UR1/&gt; The hair surrounding its nostrils is dense to help filter particulate matter out as it digs. Its tail is very thick at the base and gradually tapers.

===Head===
The greatly elongated head is set on a short, thick neck, and the end of the snout bears a disc, which houses the nostrils. It contains a thin but complete [[zygomatic arch]].&lt;ref name=UR1/&gt; The head of the aardvark contains many unique and different features. One of the most distinctive characteristics of the Tubulidentata is their [[teeth]]. Instead of having a [[pulp (tooth)|pulp cavity]], each tooth has a cluster of thin, hexagonal, upright, parallel tubes of vasodentin (a modified form of [[dentine]]), with individual pulp canals, held together by [[cementum]].&lt;ref name=UR/&gt; The number of columns is dependant on the size of the tooth, with the largest having about 1500.&lt;ref name=UR2/&gt; The teeth have no [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] coating and are worn away and regrow continuously. The aardvark is born with conventional incisors and [[canine tooth|canines]] at the front of the jaw, which fall out and are not replaced. Adult aardvarks have only cheek teeth at the back of the [[jaw]], and have a [[dentition|dental formula]] of: {{DentalFormula|upper=0.0.2-3.3|lower=0.0.2.3}} These remaining teeth are peg-like and rootless and are of unique composition.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Elizabeth A. (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; The teeth consist of 14 upper and 12 lower jaw molars.&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; The nasal area of the aardvark is another unique area, as it contains ten [[nasal conchae]], more than any other placental mammal.&lt;ref name=UR/&gt; The sides of the nostrils are thick with hair.&lt;ref name=UR1/&gt; The tip of the snout is highly mobile and is moved by modified [[mimetic muscles]].&lt;ref name=UR/&gt; The fleshy dividing tissue between its nostrils probably has sensory functions,&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; but it is uncertain if it is olfactory or vibration in nature.&lt;ref name=UR6&gt;Rahm, Urs (1990); p. 458&lt;/ref&gt; The nose contains more [[olfactory bulb]]s than any other mammal, with 9.&lt;ref name=UR1/&gt; It's keen sense of smell is not just from the quantity of bulbs in the nose but also in the development of the brain, as its [[olfactory lobe]] is very developed.&lt;ref name=UR2&gt;Rahm, Urs (1990); pp. 453-454&lt;/ref&gt; The snout resembles an elongated pig snout. The mouth is small and tubular, typical of species that feed on [[ants]] and [[termite]]s. The aardvark has a long, thin, snakelike, protruding tongue (as much as {{convert|30|cm|in}} long)&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; and elaborate structures supporting a keen [[olfaction|sense of smell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TaylorSkinner&quot;&gt;Taylor, W. A.; Skinner, J. D. (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The ears, which are very effective,&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; are disproportionately long, about {{convert|20|-|25|cm|in}} long.&lt;ref name=UR1/&gt; The eyes are small for its head, and consist only of [[rod cell|rods]].&lt;ref name=UR1/&gt;

===Digestive system===
The aardvark's stomach has a muscular [[pyloric]] area that acts as a [[gizzard]], (it grinds the food up) to make chewing not important.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; Its [[cecum]] is large.&lt;ref name=UR/&gt; Both males and females emit a strong smelling secretion from an anal gland.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; Its [[salivary gland]]s are highly developed and almost completely ring the neck,&lt;ref name=UR/&gt; and their output is what causes the tongue to maintain its tackiness.&lt;ref name=UR1/&gt; The female has two pairs of [[teat]]s in the inguinal region.&lt;ref name=UR/&gt;

[[Gene]]tically speaking, the aardvark is a [[living fossil]], as its [[chromosome]]s are highly conserved, reflecting much of the early [[eutherian]] arrangement before the divergence of the major modern [[taxon|taxa]].&lt;ref&gt;BBC (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat and range==
Aardvarks live in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], where there is suitable [[habitat]] for them to live, such as [[savanna]]s, [[grassland]]s, [[woodland]]s and [[bushland]], and available food (i.e., ants and termites).&lt;ref name=&quot;awf&quot;&gt;African Wildlife Foundation (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; They hide in dark underground burrows to avoid the warm weather.&lt;ref name=ez&gt;easyscienceforkids.com (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The only major habitat that they are not present in is swamp forest, as the high water table interferes with digging.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; They have been documented as high as {{convert|3200|m|ft}} in Ethiopia.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; They are known to live throughout sub-Saharan Africa all the way to South Africa with few exceptions. These exceptions are coastal areas of [[Namibia]], [[Ivory Coast]], and [[Ghana]].&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; They are also not present in Madagascar.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; They avoid rocky terrain as it causes problems with digging.&lt;ref name=UR3&gt;Rahm, Urs (1990); p. 455&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology and behavior==
[[File:Orycteropus afer.jpg|thumb|upright|Resting aardvark in [[Himeji]] City Zoo]]
Aardvarks live for up to 23&amp;nbsp;years in [[captivity (animal)|captivity]].&lt;ref name=UR/&gt;

Its keen hearing warns it of predators: [[lion]]s, [[leopard]]s, [[hyena]]s, and [[pythonidae|pythons]].&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt;&lt;ref name=UR6/&gt; The aardvark's main predators are lions, leopards, hunting dogs and pythons. Some humans also hunt aardvarks for meat.&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; Aardvarks can dig fast or run in zigzag fashion to elude enemies, but if all else fails, they will strike with their claws, tail and shoulders, sometimes flipping onto their backs lying motionless except to lash out with all four feet.&lt;ref name=UR6/&gt; They will also dig to escape as they can, when pressed, dig extremely quickly.&lt;ref name=UR6/&gt; Their thick skin also protects them to some extent.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===Feeding===
The aardvark is [[nocturnal]] and is a solitary creature that feeds almost exclusively on [[ant]]s and [[termite]]s ([[formivore]]);&lt;ref name=&quot;EoM&quot;&gt;van Aarde, Rudi J. (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; the only fruit eaten by aardvarks is the [[aardvark cucumber]].&lt;ref name=UR6/&gt; In fact, the cucumber and the aardvark have a symbiotic relationship as they eat the subterranean fruit, then defecate the seeds near their burrows, which then grow rapidly due to the loose soil and fertile nature of the area. The time spent in the intestine of the aardvark helps the fertility of the seed, and the fruit provides needed moisture for the aardvark.&lt;ref name=UR6/&gt; They avoid eating the [[African driver ant]] and red ants.&lt;ref name=UR4/&gt; Due to their stringent diet requirements, they require a large range to survive.&lt;ref name=UR3/&gt; An aardvark emerges from its burrow in the late afternoon or shortly after sunset, and forages over a considerable home range encompassing {{convert|10|to|30|km|mi}}. While foraging for food, the aardvark will keep its nose to the ground and its ears pointed forward, which indicates that both smell and hearing are involved in the search for food. They zig-zag as they forage and will usually not repeat a route for 5–8 days as they appear to allow time for the termite nests to recover before feeding on it again.&lt;ref name=UR4/&gt; During a foraging period, they will stop and dig a &quot;V&quot; shaped trench with their forefeet and then sniff it profusely as a means to explore their location.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; When a concentration of ants or termites is detected, the aardvark digs into it with its powerful front legs, keeping its long ears upright to listen for predators, and takes up an astonishing number of [[insects]] with its long, sticky tongue—as many as 50,000 in one night have been recorded. Its claws enable it to dig through the extremely hard crust of a termite or ant mound quickly. It avoids inhaling the dust by sealing the nostrils.&lt;ref name=ez/&gt; When successful, the aardvark's long (up to {{convert|30|cm|in}})&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; tongue licks up the insects; the termites' biting, or the ants' stinging attacks are rendered futile by the tough skin. After an aardvark visit at a termite mound, other animals will visit to pick up all the leftovers.&lt;ref name=UR5&gt;Rahm, Urs (1990); p. 457&lt;/ref&gt; Termite mounds alone don't provide enough food for the aardvark, so they look for termites that are on the move. When these insects move, they can form columns {{convert|10|-|40|m|ft}} long and these tend to provide easy pickings with little effort exerted by the aardvark. These columns are more common in areas of livestock or other hoofed animals.&lt;ref name=UR5/&gt; The trampled grass and dung attract termites from [[Odontotermes]], [[Microtermes]], and [[Pseudacanthotermes]] genera.&lt;ref name=UR5/&gt;

On a nightly basis they tend to be more active during the first portion of the night time (2000-2400); however, they don't seem to prefer bright or dark nights over the other. During adverse weather or if disturbed they will retreat to their burrow systems. They cover between {{convert|2|and|5|km|mi}} per night; however, some studies have shown that they may traverse as far as {{convert|30|km|mi}} in a night.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt;

===Vocalization===
The aardvark is a rather quiet animal. However it does make soft grunting sounds as it forages and loud grunts as it makes for its tunnel entrance.&lt;ref name=UR3/&gt; It makes a bleating sound if frightened.&lt;ref name=UR4&gt;Rahm, Urs (1990); p. 456&lt;/ref&gt; When it is threatened it will make for one of its burrows. If one is not close it will dig a new one rapidly. This new one will be short and require the aardvark to back out when the coast is clear.&lt;ref name=UR4/&gt;

===Movement===
The aardvark is known to be a good swimmer and has been witnessed successfully swimming in strong currents.&lt;ref name=UR4/&gt; It can dig 1 yard of tunnel in about 5 minutes,&lt;ref name=UR3/&gt; but otherwise moves fairly slowly.

When leaving the burrow at night, they pause at the entrance for about ten minutes, sniffing and listening. After this period of watchfulness, it will bound out and within seconds is {{convert|10|m|ft}} away. It will then pause, prick its ears, twisting its head to listen, then jump and moves off to start foraging.&lt;ref name=UR3/&gt;

Aside from digging out ants and termites, the aardvark also [[fossorial|excavates]] burrows in which to live; of which they generally fall into three categories: burrows made while foraging, refuge and resting location, and permanent homes.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; Temporary sites are scattered around the home range and are used as refuges, while the main [[burrow]] is also used for breeding. Main burrows can be deep and extensive, have several entrances and can be as long as {{convert|13|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; These burrows can be large enough for a man to enter.&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; The aardvark changes the layout of its home burrow regularly, and periodically moves on and makes a new one The old burrows are an important part of the African wildlife scene. As they are vacated, then they are inhabited by smaller animals like the [[African Wild Dog|African wild dog]], [[Termite chat]], ''[[Nycteris thebaica]]'' and warthogs.&lt;ref name=UR4/&gt; Other animals that use them are hares, mongooses, hyenas, owls, pythons, and lizards. Without these refuges many animals would die during wildfire season.&lt;ref name=UR4/&gt; Only mothers and young share burrows; however, the aardvark is known to live in small family groups or as a solitary creature.&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; If attacked in the tunnel, it will escape by digging out of the tunnel thereby placing the fresh fill between it and its predator, or if it decides to fight it will roll onto its back, and attack with its claws.&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; The aardvark has been known to sleep in a recently excavated [[ant]] nest, which also serves as protection from its [[predator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Animal Corner (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aardvarks.jpg|thumb|left|Aardvark mother and young]]

===Reproduction===
Aardvarks pair only during the breeding season; after a [[gestation]] period of seven months,&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; one cub weighing around {{convert|1.7|-|1.9|kg|lb}}&lt;ref name=UR/&gt; is born during May–July.&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; When born, the young has flaccid ears and many wrinkles.

Aardvarks were thought to have declining numbers,&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; however this is possibly due to the fact that they are not readily seen.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; There are no definitive counts because of their nocturnal and secretive habits; however their numbers seem to be stable overall. They are not considered common anywhere in Africa, but due to their large range, they maintain sufficient numbers. There may be a slight decrease in numbers in eastern, northern, and western Africa. Southern African numbers are not decreasing. It receives an official designation from the IUCN as [[least concern]].&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; However, they are a species in a precarious situation as they are so dependent on such specific food; therefore if a problem arises with the abundance of termites, the species as a whole would be affected drastically.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt;

Aardvarks handle captivity well, and the first zoo to have one was the [[London Zoo]] in 1869, from [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name=UR6/&gt;

==Mythology and popular culture==
In [[African folklore]], the aardvark is much admired because of its diligent quest for food and its fearless response to [[army ants|soldier ants]]. [[Hausa people|Hausa]] magicians make a charm from the heart, skin, forehead, and nails of the aardvark, which they then proceed to pound together with the root of a certain tree. Wrapped in a piece of skin and worn on the chest, the charm is said to give the owner the ability to pass through walls or roofs at night. The charm is said to be used by burglars and those seeking to visit young girls without their parents' permission.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some tribes, such as the [[Mangbetu people|Margbetu]], [[Ayanda]], and [[Logo people|Logo]],&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; will use their teeth to make bracelets that are regarded as good luck charms.&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; Also their meat which has a resemblance to pork is enjoyed by many.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt;

The [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian god]] [[Set (mythology)|Set]] is said (by some) to have the head of an aardvark or to be part aardvark.&lt;ref&gt;Ty Velde, Henk (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

The titular character of ''[[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur]]'', an animated television series for children based on a book series and produced by [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]], shown in more than 180 countries, is an aardvark.&lt;ref&gt;WGBH (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''aardwolf''' (''Proteles cristata'') is a small, [[insectivore|insectivorous]] [[mammal]], native to [[East Africa]] and [[Southern Africa]]. Its name means &quot;earth wolf&quot; in the [[Afrikaans]] / [[Dutch language]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; It is also called &quot;maanhaar jackal&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;&gt;Oxford English Dictionary Online (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; or ''civet hyena'', based on the secretions (civet) from their anal glands.&lt;ref name=ingo/&gt; The aardwolf is in the same family as the [[hyena]]s. Unlike its relatives in the order [[Carnivora]], the aardwolf does not hunt large [[animal]]s, or even eat meat on a regular basis; instead it eats [[insect]]s, mainly [[termite]]s - one aardwolf can eat about 200,000 termites during a single night by using its long, sticky [[tongue]] to capture them. The aardwolf lives in the scrublands of eastern and southern Africa - these are open lands covered with stunted trees and shrubs. The aardwolf is [[nocturnal]], resting in [[burrow]]s during the day and emerging at night to seek food. Their diet consists mainly of termites, insect [[larva]]e, and the [[carrion]] of larger animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;wff&quot;&gt;International Masters Publishers (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
The aardwolf is the only surviving species in the mammalian [[subfamily]] '''Protelinae'''. There is disagreement as to whether there are any subspecies or if the species is monotypic. Some sources say that there are two [[subspecies]], ''Proteles cristatus cristatus'' of [[Southern Africa]] and ''Proteles cristatus septentrionalis'' of [[East Africa]],&lt;ref name=ingo/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koepfli, Klaus-Peter; Jenks, Susan, M.; Eizirik, Eduardo; Zahirpour, Tannaz; Van Valkenburgh, Blaire; Wayne, Robert K. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; whereas others say it is monotypic.&lt;ref name=Woz&gt;Wozencraft, W. Christopher (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

The aardwolf is usually classified with the [[Hyaenidae]], though it was formerly placed into the family '''Protelidae'''.

==Etymology==
The genus name ''proteles'' comes from two words both of [[Greek language|Greek]] origin, ''protos'' and ''teleos'' which combined means &quot;complete in front&quot; based on the fact that they have 5 toes on their front feet and four on the rear.&lt;ref name=ingo/&gt; The species name, ''cristatus'' comes from [[Latin]] and means &quot;provided with a comb&quot;, relating to their mane.&lt;ref name=ingo/&gt;

==Physical characteristics==
[[Image:Aardwolf02.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of head - taken at the [[Cincinnati Zoo]]. Note the ability to rotate the ears.]]
The aardwolf resembles a very thin [[striped hyena]], but with a more slender [[snout|muzzle]], black vertical stripes on a coat of yellowish fur, and a long, distinct [[:wikt:mane|mane]] down the midline of the neck and back. The mane is raised during confrontations in order to make the aardwolves appear larger. It is missing the throat spot that others in the family have.&lt;ref name=ingo/&gt; The aardwolf is about {{convert|55|to|80|cm|in}} long, excluding its bushy tail, which is about {{convert|20|-|30|cm|in}} long,&lt;ref name=EB&gt;Hoiberg, Dale H. (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; and stands about {{convert|40|to|50|cm|in}} tall at the shoulders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colliers&quot;&gt;Goodwin, George G. (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; An adult aardwolf weighs approximately {{convert|7|-|10|kg|lb}}, sometimes reaching  {{convert|15|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref name=ingo&gt;Rieger, Ingo (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; The front feet have five toes each, unlike the four-toed hyena.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; The teeth and skull are similar to those of the hyena, though smaller,&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; and its cheek teeth are specialised for eating insects.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Its ears are very similar to the [[Striped Hyena]].&lt;ref name=ingo/&gt;

As the aardwolf ages, it will normally lose some of its teeth, though this has little impact on their feeding habits due to the softness of the insects that they eat.&lt;ref name=&quot;wff&quot; /&gt; The aardwolf has two anal glands that secrete a musky fluid for marking territory and for communicating with other aardwolves.

==Distribution and habitat==
Aardwolves live in open, dry plains and [[bushland]], avoiding mountainous areas. Due to their specific food requirements, they are only found in regions where termites of the family [[Hodotermitidae]] occur. Termites of this family depend on dead and withered grass and are most populous in heavily grazed [[grassland]]s and [[savannah]]s, including [[arable land|farmland]]. For most of the year, aardwolves spend time in shared territories consisting of up to a dozen dens, which are occupied for six weeks at a time.&lt;ref name=&quot;wff&quot; /&gt;

There are two distinct populations: one in Southern Africa, and another in East and Northeast Africa. The species does not occur in the intermediary [[miombo]] forests.

An adult pair, along with their most recent offspring, will occupy a territory of {{convert|1|-|2|km2|sqmi}}.&lt;ref name=PKR/&gt;

==Behavior==
[[Image:Aardwolf.jpg|thumb|left|Aardwolf at the [[San Antonio Zoo and Aquarium|San Antonio Zoo]]]]
Aardwolves are shy and [[nocturnal animal|nocturnal]], sleeping in underground burrows by day.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; They usually use existing burrows of [[aardvark]]s, [[Old World porcupine|porcupine]]s or [[springhare]]s, despite being capable of creating their own.

They have often been mistaken for solitary animals. In fact, they live as monogamous pairs with their young.&lt;ref name=&quot;koel&quot;&gt;Koehler, C. E.; Richardson, P. R. K. (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; If their territory is infringed upon, they will chase the intruder up to {{convert|400|m|ft}}. If the intruder is caught a fight will occur, which is accompanied by hoarse barking and a type of roar.&lt;ref name=PKR/&gt; The majority of incursions occur during mating season, when they can occur 1-2 times per week.&lt;ref name=PKR/&gt; When food is scarce the stringent territorial system may be abandoned and as many as three pairs may occupy a &quot;single territory.&quot;&lt;ref name=PKR/&gt;

The territory is marked by both sexes, as they both have developed anal glands from which they extrude a black substance that is smeared on rocks or grass stalks in {{convert|5|mm|in}} long streaks.&lt;ref name=PKR/&gt; They often mark near termite mounds within their territory every 20 minutes or so. If they are patrolling their territorial boundaries, the marking frequency increases drastically, to once every {{convert|50|m|ft}}. At this rate, an individual may mark 60 marks per hour.&lt;ref name=PKR/&gt;

An aardwolf pair may have up to ten dens, and numerous [[midden]]s, within their territory. When they deposit feces at their middens, they dig a small hole and then cover it with sand. Their dens may be abandoned [[aardvark]] or [[porcupine]] dens, or on occasion they are crevices in rocks. They will also dig their own dens, or enlarge dens started by springhares.&lt;ref name=PKR/&gt; They typically will only use one or two dens at a time, rotating through all of their dens every 6 months. During the summer, they may rest outside their den during the night, and sleep underground during the heat of the day.

Aardwolfs are not fast runners nor are they particularly adept at fighting off predators. Therefore, when threatened, the aardwolf will attempt to mislead its foe by doubling back on its tracks. If confronted it will raise its mane in an attempt to appear more menacing. It will also emit a foul-smelling liquid from its anal glands.&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt;

===Feeding===
The aardwolf feeds primarily on termites and more specifically on ''[[Trinervitermes trinervoides]]''.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;&lt;ref name=PKR&gt;Richardson, Phillip K. R.; Bearder, Simon K. (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; They locate their food by sound and also from the scent secreted by the soldier termites.&lt;ref name=PKR/&gt; An aardwolf may consume up to 200,000 [[termites]] per night using its sticky, long tongue.&lt;ref name=&quot;wff&quot; /&gt; They do not destroy the termite mound or consume the entire colony, thus ensuring that the termites can rebuild and provide a continuous supply of food. They will often memorize the location of such nests and return to them. During certain seasonal events, such as the onset of the rainy season and the cold of mid-winter, the primary termites become scarce and so the need for other forms of sustenance becomes pronounced. During these times the aardwolf will seek out [[Hodotermes mossambicus]], a type of [[harvester termite]].&lt;ref name=PKR/&gt; They are also known to feed on other insects, larvae, eggs and occasionally small [[mammals]] and [[birds]], but these constitute a very small percentage of their total diet.&lt;ref name=PKR/&gt; Unlike other [[hyena]]s, aardwolves do not scavenge or kill larger animals.The adult aardwolf was formerly assumed to forage in small groups,&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; however more recent research has shown that they are primarily solitary foragers,&lt;ref name=koel/&gt; necessary because of the scarcity of their insect prey. Their primary source, ''Trinervitermes'', forages in small but dense patches of {{convert|25|-|100|cm|in}}.&lt;ref name=PKR/&gt;

===Breeding===
The [[breeding season]] varies depending on their location, but normally takes place during autumn or spring. During the breeding season, unpaired male aardwolves will search their own territory, as well as others, for a female to mate with. Dominant males will also mate opportunistically with the females of less dominant neighboring aardwolves. This can often result in conflict between rival males.&lt;ref name=ingo/&gt; [[Gestation]] lasts between 89 and 92 days,&lt;ref name=ingo/&gt; producing two to five [[List of animal names|cubs]] (most often two or three) during the rainy season (Nov-Dec),&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; when termites are more active.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; They are born with their eyes open but initially are helpless,&lt;ref name=PKR/&gt; and weigh around {{convert|200|-|350|g|oz}}.&lt;ref name=ingo/&gt; The first six to eight weeks are spent in the [[Burrow|den]] with their parents. The male may spend up to six hours a night watching over the cubs while the mother is out looking for food.&lt;ref name=PKR/&gt; After three months, they begin supervised foraging and by four months are normally independent, though they will often share a den with their mother until the next breeding season. By the time the next set of cubs is ready to start foraging, the older cubs have moved on. They can achieve a [[life expectancy|lifespan]] of up to 24 years when in [[captivity (animal)|captivity]].&lt;ref name=ingo/&gt; Aardwolves generally achieve [[sexual maturity]] at one and a half to two years of age.&lt;ref name=ingo/&gt;

==Conservation==
The aardwolf has not seen decreasing numbers and they are relatively widespread throughout eastern Africa. They are not common throughout their range, as they maintain a density of no more than 1 per square kilometer, if the food is good. Because of these factors, the IUCN has rated the aardwolf as [[least concern]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IUCN&quot;&gt;{{IUCN | id =18372| taxon =Proteles cristata | assessors =Anderson, H &amp; Mills, G.| assessment_year =2008 | version =3.1 | accessdate =04/06/2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are persecuted by man because of the mistaken belief that they prey on livestock. However, they are actually beneficial to the farmers because their food, the termites are detrimental to farming and they eat 200,000 per night.&lt;ref name=PKR/&gt;

==Interaction with humans==
[[Agriculture]] may create a negative impact on their population due to use of poisons by farmers.&lt;ref name=&quot;IUCN&quot;/&gt; They are often considered useful, non-dangerous animals by farmers. However, in some areas the aardwolf is hunted for its fur. Encounters with [[dog]]s are another threat.

'''Adobe''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|d|oʊ|b|i}}, {{IPAc-en|UK|ə|ˈ|d|oʊ|b}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0009300 definition of adobe from Oxford Dictionaries Online]. Retrieved 25 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-es|aˈðoβe}}; Arabic: الطوب) is a [[natural building]] material made from [[sand]], [[clay]], [[water]],  and some kind of fibrous or [[organic material]] (sticks, [[straw]], and/or [[manure]]), which the builders shape into bricks (using frames) and dry in the sun. Adobe buildings are similar to [[cob (building)|cob]] and [[mudbrick]] buildings.

For a deeper understanding of adobe, one might examine a cob building.  [[Cob (building)|Cob]], a close cousin to adobe, contains proportioned amounts of soil, clay, water, manure, and straw.  This is blended, but not formed like adobe. Cob is spread and piled over the home's frame and allowed to air dry for several months before habitation. Adobe, then, can be described as dried bricks of cob, stacked and mortared together with more adobe mixture to create a thick wall and/or roof.

Adobe structures are extremely durable, and account for some of the oldest existing buildings in the world. Compared to wooden buildings, adobe buildings offer significant advantages due to their greater [[thermal mass]], in hot [[climate]]s, but they are known to be particularly susceptible to earthquake damage.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livingatlaschile.com/?s=adobe Short documentary about adobe preparation and [[2010 Chile earthquake]]] Livingatlaschile.com, FICh, retrieved March 5, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Collyns |first=Dan |authorlink= |title=Peru rebuilds two years on from quake |work= |publisher=news.bbc.co.uk |date=2009-08-15 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8201971.stm |doi= |accessdate=2009-08-24 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090815100847/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8201971.stm| archivedate= 15 August 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}} Cases where adobe structures were widely damaged during earthquakes include the [[1976 Guatemala earthquake]] and the [[2003 Bam earthquake]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloomington: University of Indiana Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[South America]], southwestern [[North America]],  [[Spain]] (usually in the [[Mudéjar]] style), Eastern Europe&lt;ref&gt;Museum of Lithuanian life Rumsiskes Lithuania (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[East Anglia]], particularly [[Norfolk]], known as ''clay lump''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eartha.org.uk . Retrieved 19-2-2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Adobe had been in use by [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] in the [[Southwestern United States]], [[Mesoamerica]], and the [[Andes|Andean region]] of South America for several thousand years, although often substantial amounts of stone are used in the walls of [[Pueblo]] buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Beck | first = Roger B. | authorlink = | coauthors = Linda Black, Larry S.

Adobe brickmaking was used in Spain starting by the Late Bronze Age and Iron Age, from the eighth century B.C. on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= de Chazelles-Gazzal|first=Claire-Anne|title=Les maisons en terre de la Gaule méridionale|publisher=Éditions Monique Mergoil|year=1997|location=Montagnac, France|pages=49–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its wide use can be attributed to its simplicity of design and manufacture, and the economy of creating it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Natural hazards in El Salvador|last=Rose|first=William I.|author2=Julian J.

A distinction is sometimes made between the smaller ''adobes'', which are about the size of ordinary baked bricks, and the larger ''adobines'', some of which may be one to two yards (1–2&amp;nbsp;m) long.

==Etymology==
[[File:San Pedro de Atacama church.jpg|thumb|left|Church at [[San Pedro de Atacama]], [[Chile]]]]
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
The word ''adobe'' {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|d|oʊ|b|iː}} has existed for around 4,000 years, with relatively little change in either pronunciation or meaning. The word can be traced from the [[Middle Egyptian]] (c. 2000&amp;nbsp;BC) word ''dj-b-t'' &quot;mud [''i.e.'', sun-dried] brick.&quot; As Middle Egyptian evolved into [[Late Egyptian]], [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]], and finally [[Coptic language|Coptic]] (c. 600&amp;nbsp;BC), ''dj-b-t'' became ''tobe'' &quot;[mud] brick.&quot;  This was borrowed into [[Arabic]] as ''al-tub'' (الطّوب ''al'' &quot;the&quot; + ''tub'' &quot;brick&quot;) &quot;[mud] brick,&quot; which was assimilated into [[Old Spanish]] as ''adobe'' {{IPA|[aˈdobe]}}, still with the meaning &quot;mud brick.&quot;  English borrowed the word from Spanish in the early 18th century.

[[File:Santa Fe adobe.jpg|thumb|Adobe style in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]]]]
In more modern English usage, the term &quot;adobe&quot; has come to include a style of architecture popular in the [[desert]] [[climate]]s of [[North America]], especially in [[New Mexico]].  (Compare with [[stucco]]).

==Composition==
An adobe brick is a [[composite material]] made of clay mixed with water and an organic material such as straw or dung. The soil composition typically contains [[clay]] and [[sand]]. Straw is useful in binding the brick together and allowing the brick to dry evenly, thereby preventing cracking due to uneven shrinkage rates through the brick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vargas|first=J.|author2=J. Bariola|author3= M. Blondet|title=Seismic Strength of Adobe Masonry|journal=Materials and Structures|year=1986|volume=9|pages=253–256|doi=10.1007/BF02472107}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[feces|Dung]] offers the same advantage and is also added to repel insects.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The most desirable soil texture for producing the mud of adobe is 15% clay, 10-30% silt and 55-75% fine sand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garrison|first=James|title=Adobe-The Material, Its Deterioration, Its Coatings|url=http://missions.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/1%20Garrison-Adobe%20Characteristics.pdf|accessdate=27 February 2013|pages=5–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another source quotes 15-25% clay and the remainder sand and coarser particles up to cobbles 2-10 inches with no deleterious effect. Modern adobe is stabilized with either emulsified asphalt or Portland cement up to 10% by weight.

The clay content should be a mixture of no more that half [[expansive clay]]s with the remainder non-expansive illite or kaolinite. Too much expansive clay results in uneven drying through the brick and cracking while too much kaolinite will make a weak brick. Typically the soils of the Southwest United States where such construction is in use, are an adequate composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Austin |first=George |url=http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/publications/periodicals/nmg/downloads/6/n4/nmg_v6_n4_p69.pdf |work=New Mexico Geology, November 1984 |publisher=New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral Resources |title=Adobe as a building material |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-02-27 |page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adobe bricks==
[[File:Milyanfan-adobe-bricks-8038.jpg|thumb|Adobe bricks near a construction site in [[Milyanfan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]]]]
Bricks are made in an open frame, {{convert|25|cm|0|abbr=on}} by {{convert|36|cm|0|abbr=on}} being a reasonable size, but any convenient size is acceptable. The mixture is molded into a frame, and then the frame is removed after initial setting. After drying a few hours, the bricks are turned on edge to finish drying.  Slow drying in shade reduces cracking.

The same mixture used to make bricks, but without straw, is used for mortar and often for plaster on interior and exterior walls. Some ancient cultures used lime-based cement for the plaster to protect against rain damage. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

The brick’s thickness is preferred partially due to its thermal characteristics, and partially due to the stability of a thicker brick versus a more standard-sized brick.  Depending on the form into which the mixture is pressed, adobe can encompass nearly any shape or size, provided drying is even and the mixture includes reinforcement for larger bricks.  Reinforcement can include manure, straw, [[cement]], [[rebar]] or wooden posts.  Experience has shown straw, cement, or manure added to a standard adobe mixture can all produce a stronger, more crack-resistant brick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Technical Information Online |url=http://practicalaction.org/docs/technical_information_service/mud_plasters_and_renders.pdf |title=Mud Plasters and Renders - Technical Information Online - Practical Answers |publisher=Practicalaction.org |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A general testing is done on the soil content first.  To do so, a sample of the soil is mixed into a clear container with some water, creating an almost completely saturated liquid.  After it is sealed, the container is shaken vigorously for at least one minute.  It is then allowed to sit on a flat surface for a day or so until the soil has settled into layers or remains in suspension. Heavier particles settle out first, so gravel will be on the bottom, sand above, silt above that and very fine clay and organic matter will stay in suspension for days. After the water has cleared, percentages of the various particles can be determined. Fifty to 60 percent sand and 35 to 40 percent clay will yield strong bricks. The [[New Mexico State University]] [[Cooperative extension service|Extension Service]] recommends a mix of not more than 1/3 clay, not less than 1/2 sand, and never more than 1/3 silt.

==Material properties==

Adobe walls are load bearing, i.e. they carry their own weight into the foundation rather than by another structure, hence the adobe must have sufficient compressive strength. In the United States, most building codes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quentinwilson.squarespace.com/storage/adobecode.pdf |title=14.7.4 NMAC |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; call for a minimum compressive strength of 300&amp;nbsp;lbf/in.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Adobe construction should be designed so as to avoid lateral structural loads that would cause bending loads. The building codes require the building sustain a 1 g lateral acceleration earthquake load. Such an acceleration will cause lateral loads on the walls, resulting in shear and bending and inducing tensile stresses. To withstand such loads, the codes typically call for a tensile modulus of rupture strength of at least 50&amp;nbsp;lbf/in.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

In addition to being an inexpensive material with a small resource cost, adobe can serve as a significant heat reservoir due to the thermal properties inherent in the massive walls typical in adobe construction. In climates typified by hot days and cool nights, the high thermal mass of adobe averages out the high and low temperatures of the day, moderating the living space temperature.  The massive walls require a large and relatively long input of heat from the sun ([[radiation]]) and from the surrounding air ([[convection]]) before they warm through to the interior. After the sun sets and the temperature drops, the warm wall will then continue to transfer heat to the interior for several hours due to the time lag effect. Thus, a well-planned adobe wall of the appropriate thickness is very effective at controlling inside temperature through the wide daily fluctuations typical of desert climates, a factor which has contributed to its longevity as a building material.

Thermodynamic material properties are sparsely quoted. The thermal conductivity of adobe is quoted as having an R value of R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.41 hr*ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;*°F/(Btu*in).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emnrd.state.nm.us/ECMD/FORMS/documents/MANUAL2.1.pdf |title=2009 New Mexico Energy Conservation Code: Residential Applications Manual |publisher=Emnrd.state.nm.us |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; To determine the total R value, multiply R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, by the thickness of the adobe wall. From that, the conductivity is found to be k = 0.20 Btu/(hr*ft*°F) or 0.35 W/(m*K). The heat capacity is commonly quoted as c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.20 Btu/(lbm*F) or 840 joules/(kg*K).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenhomebuilding.com/QandA/adobe/mass.htm |title=Mass and insulation with adobe |publisher=Green Home Building |accessdate=2013-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The density is 95 lbm/ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or 1520&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The thermal diffusivity is calculated to 0.0105&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/hr or 2.72x10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s.

==Adobe wall construction==
When building an adobe structure, the ground should be compressed because the weight of adobe bricks is significantly greater than a frame house, and foundation settling may cause cracking in the wall.  The footing is dug and compressed once again.  Footing depth depends on the region and its ground frost level.  The footing and stem wall are commonly 24 and 14&amp;nbsp;inches, much larger than a frame house because  of the weight of the walls.  Adobe bricks are laid by course.  Each [[Course (architecture)|course]] is laid the whole length of the wall, overlapping at the corners on a layer of adobe mortar.  Adobe walls usually never rise above two stories because they are load bearing and have low structural strength.  When placing window and door openings, a [[lintel]] is placed on top of the opening to support the bricks above.  Atop the last courses of brick, bond beams made of reinforced concrete or heavy wood beams are laid to provide a horizontal bearing plate for the roof beams and to redistribute lateral earthquake loads to shear walls more able to carry the forces. To protect the interior and exterior adobe wall, finishes can be applied, such as mud plaster, whitewash or stucco.  These finishes protect the adobe wall from water damage, but need to be reapplied periodically, or the walls can be finished with other nontraditional plasters providing longer protection. Bricks made with stabilized adobe generally do not need protection of plasters.

==Adobe roof==
The traditional adobe roof has been constructed using a mixture of soil/clay, water, sand, and organic materials.  The mixture was then formed and pressed into wood forms, producing rows of dried earth bricks that would then be laid across a support structure of wood and plastered into place with more adobe.

===Roof materials===
Depending on the materials available, a roof may be assembled using wood or metal beams to create a framework to begin layering adobe bricks. Depending on the thickness of the adobe bricks, the framework has been preformed using a steel framing and a layering of a metal fencing or wiring over the framework to allow an even load as masses of adobe are spread across the metal fencing like cob and allowed to air dry accordingly.  This method was demonstrated with an adobe blend heavily impregnated with cement to allow even drying and prevent cracking.

===Traditional adobe roof===
The more traditional flat adobe roofs are functional only in dry climates that are not exposed to snow loads which would call for a steepled roof. Cement may be introduced into the adobe mixture to stabilize and strengthen the composite of mud and organic matter. The heaviest wooden beams are called [[Viga (architecture)|Vigas]] which support smaller members called latias &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dl-building.com/preservation-historic-adobe-buildings/ |title=Preservation of Historic Adobe Buildings |publisher=Dawson Lupul |accessdate=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; upon which brush is then laid atop which the adobe layer applied.

===Raising a traditional adobe roof===
To raise a flattened adobe roof, beams of wood or metal should be assembled and span the extent of the building. The ends of the beams should then be attached  to the tops of the walls. Taking into account the material from which the beams and walls are made, choosing the attachments may prove difficult. A combination of the bricks and adobe mortar that are laid across the beams creates an even load-bearing pressure that can last for many years depending on attrition.

Once the vigas, satias and brush are laid, adobe bricks are placed. An adobe roof is often laid with bricks slightly larger in width to ensure a greater expanse is covered when placing the bricks onto the roof. Following each individual brick should be a layer of adobe mortar, recommended to be at least an inch thick to make certain there is ample strength between the brick’s edges and also to provide a relative moisture barrier during rain. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

===Attributes===
Depending on the materials, adobe roofs can be inherently fire-proof.  The construction of a chimney can greatly influence the construction of the roof supports, creating an extra need for care in choosing the materials.  The builders can make an adobe chimney by stacking simple adobe bricks in a similar fashion as the surrounding walls.

==Adobe around the world==
The largest structure ever made from adobe (bricks) was the [[Bam Citadel]], which suffered serious damage (up to 80%) by an earthquake on December 26, 2003. Other large adobe structures are the [[Huaca del Sol]] in [[Peru]], with 100 million signed bricks, the ''ciudellas'' of [[Chan Chan]] and [[Tambo Colorado]], both in Peru (in South America).

An '''adventure''' is an exciting or unusual experience. It may also be a bold, usually [[risk]]y undertaking, with an uncertain outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/adventure |title=Adventure |work=dictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adventures may be activities with some potential for physical danger such as [[skydiving]], [[mountain climbing]], [[river rafting]] or participating in [[extreme sports]]. The term also broadly refers to any enterprise that is potentially fraught with physical, financial or psychological risk, such as a business venture, a love affair, or other major life undertakings.

==Motivation==
Adventurous experiences create psychological  [[arousal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://books.google.com/?id=6YjcgAn8TfsC&amp;pg=PA187 |title=On the psychobiology of personality |chapter=Sensation Seeking and Participation in Physical Risk Sports |author=M Gomà-i-Freixanet |year=2004 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-08-044209-9 |page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be interpreted as negative (e.g. [[fear]]) or positive (e.g. [[flow (psychology)|flow]]), and which can be detrimental as stated by the [[Yerkes-Dodson law]].  For some people, adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself. According to adventurer [[André Malraux]], in his ''La Condition Humaine'' (1933), &quot;If a man is not ready to risk his life, where is his dignity?&quot;.{{full|date=June 2013}} Similarly, [[Helen Keller]] stated that &quot;Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keller|first=Helen|title=The Open Door|year=1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the purposes of [[recreation]] or [[excitement]]: examples are  [[adventure racing]] and [[Adventure travel|adventure tourism]]. Adventurous activities can also lead to gains in knowledge, such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers. [[Adventure education]] intentionally uses challenging experiences for [[learning]].

Some of the oldest and most widespread stories in the world are stories of adventure such as [[Homer|Homer's]] ''[[The Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/books/review/Mansbach-t.html|title=Odysseus Remixed|author=Adam Mansbach|date=12 February 2010|newspaper=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard Jenkyns |url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/31/reviews/fagles-odyssey.html |title=Heroic Enterprise – (Book review: The Odyssey translated by Robert Fagles) |publisher=nytimes.com |date=1996-12-22 |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zweig, P. (1974). ''The adventurer: The fate of adventure in the Western world'', New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]] discussed his notion of the [[monomyth]] in his book, ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''. Campbell proposed that the heroic mythological stories from culture to culture followed a similar underlying pattern, starting with the &quot;call to adventure&quot;, followed by a hazardous journey, and eventual triumph. 

The [[knight errant]] was the form the &quot;adventure seeker&quot; character took in the late Middle Ages.

The [[adventure novel]] exhibits these &quot;protagonist on adventurous journey&quot; characteristics as do many popular feature films, such as ''[[Star Wars]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/26/movies/moviesspecial/26STAR.html|title=A Trip to a Far Galaxy That's Fun and Funny|author=Vincent Canby|date=26 May 1977|newspaper=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF173AA42CA1494CC6B6799D836896|title=Movie Review: Raiders of the Lost Ark|author=Vincent Canby|date=12 June 1981|newspaper=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Asia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|ʒ|ə|audio=En-us-Asia.ogg}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|ʃ|ə}}) is the world's largest and most populous [[continent]], located primarily in the [[Eastern Hemisphere|eastern]] and [[northern hemisphere]]s. It covers 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area and comprises 30% of its land area. With approximately 4.3 billion people, it hosts 60% of the world's current [[human population]]. Asia has a high growth rate in the modern era. For instance, during the 20th century, Asia's population nearly quadrupled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.economist.com/diversions/millennium/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=346605 | title=Like herrings in a barrel | journal=The Economist | date=23 December 1999 | issue=Millennium issue: Population | publisher=The ''Economist'' online, The Economist Group}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The boundaries of Asia are culturally determined, as there is no clear geographical separation between it and [[Europe]], which together form one continuous landmass called [[Eurasia]]. The most commonly accepted boundaries place Asia to the east of the [[Suez Canal]], the [[Ural River]], and the [[Ural Mountains]], and south of the [[Caucasus Mountains]] (or the [[Kuma–Manych Depression]]) and the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Black Sea]]s.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Asia | url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110518/Asia | encyclopedia=eb.com, [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | year=2006 | location=Chicago | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=National Geographic Atlas of the World|edition=7th|year=1999|location=Washington, DC|publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]|isbn=978-0-7922-7528-2}} &quot;Europe&quot; (pp. 68–9); &quot;Asia&quot; (pp. 90–1): &quot;A commonly accepted division between Asia and Europe is formed by the Ural Mountains, Ural River, Caspian Sea, Caucasus Mountains, and the Black Sea with its outlets, the Bosporus and Dardanelles.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It is bounded on the east by the [[Pacific Ocean]], on the south by the [[Indian Ocean]] and on the north by the [[Arctic Ocean]].

Given its size and diversity, the concept of Asia – a [[toponymy|name]] dating back to [[classical antiquity]] - may actually have more to do with [[human geography]] than [[physical geography]].&lt;ref name=McG-H&gt;{{cite web | title=Asia | url=http://accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=054800&amp;referURL=http%3a%2f%2faccessscience.com%2fcontent.aspx%3fid%3d054800 | work=AccessScience | publisher=McGraw-Hill | accessdate=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asia varies greatly across and within [[Regions of Asia|its regions]] with regard to ethnic groups, cultures, environments, economics, historical ties and government systems.

== Definition and boundaries ==

{{details3|[[Geography of Asia#Boundary|Geography of Asia]], [[Boundaries between continents]], [[List of transcontinental countries#Asia and Europe|List of transcontinental countries]] and [[Copenhagen criteria]]|Asian borders}}

===Greek three-continent system===
[[File:two-point-equidistant-asia.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Two-point equidistant projection]] of Asia and surrounding landmasses.]]
[[File:Asiatiska folk, Nordisk familjebok.jpg|thumb|The racial diversity of Asia's peoples, [[Nordisk familjebok]] (1904)]]
The border between Asia and Europe has historically been determined by Europeans only. The original distinction between the two was made by the [[ancient Greek]]s. They used the [[Aegean Sea]], the [[Dardanelles]], the [[Sea of Marmara]], the [[Bosporus]], the [[Black Sea]], the [[Kerch Strait]], and the [[Sea of Azov]] as the border between Asia and Europe. The [[Nile]] was often used as the border between Asia and [[Africa]] (then called Libya), although some Greek geographers suggested the [[Red Sea]] would form a better boundary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Myth&quot;&gt;{{harvnb | Lewis | Wigen | 1997 | pp=170–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Darius I|Darius]]' canal between the Nile and the Red Sea introduced considerable variation in opinion. Under the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] emptying into the Black Sea was the western border of Asia. It was the northernmost navigable point of the European shore.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} In the 15th century the Red Sea became established as the boundary between Africa and Asia, replacing the Nile.&lt;ref name=&quot;Myth&quot;/&gt;

===Asia–Europe boundary===
The Don River became unsatisfactory to northern Europeans when [[Peter the Great]], king of the [[Tsardom of Russia]], defeating rival claims of [[Sweden]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] to the eastern lands, and armed resistance by the tribes of [[Siberia]], synthesized a new [[Russian Empire]] extending to the [[Ural Mountains]] and beyond, founded in 1721. The major geographical theorist of the empire was actually a former Swedish prisoner-of-war, taken at the [[Battle of Poltava]] in 1709 and assigned to [[Tobolsk]], where he associated with Peter's Siberian official, [[Vasily Tatishchev]], and was allowed freedom to conduct geographical and anthropological studies in preparation for a future book.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In Sweden, five years after Peter's death, in 1730 [[Philip Johan von Strahlenberg]] published a new atlas proposing the Urals as the border of Asia. The Russians were enthusiastic about the concept, which allowed them to keep their European identity in geography. Tatishchev announced that he had proposed the idea to von Strahlenberg. The latter had suggested the [[Emba River]] as the lower boundary. Over the next century various proposals were made until the [[Ural River]] prevailed in the mid-19th century. The border had been moved perforce from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea into which the Ural River projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|Wigen|1997|pp=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the maps of the period, [[Transcaucasia]] was counted as Asian. The incorporation of most of that region into the [[Soviet Union]] tended to push views of the border to the south. Asian cultures had no say in this system of determining the imaginary boundaries separating them from Europe.

===Asia–Oceania boundary===
The border between Asia and the loosely-defined region of [[Oceania]] is usually placed somewhere in the [[Malay Archipelago]]. The terms Southeast Asia and Oceania, devised in the 19th century, have had several vastly different geographic meanings since their inception. The chief factor in determining which islands of the Malay Archipelago are Asian has been the location of the colonial possessions of the various empires there (not all European). Lewis and Wigen assert, &quot;The narrowing of 'Southeast Asia' to its present boundaries was thus a gradual process.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Myth&quot;/&gt;

===Ongoing definition===
[[File:Afro-Eurasia (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|left|[[Afro-Eurasia]] shown in green]]
Geographical Asia is a cultural artifact of European conceptions of the world being imposed onto other cultures, an imprecise concept causing endemic contention about what it means. Asia is larger and more culturally diverse than Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|Wigen|1997|pp=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not exactly correspond to the cultural borders of its various types of constituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|Wigen|1997|pp=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its general inherited geographical meaning, to which the entire literate world subscribes, Asia has any number of agency-specific meanings organizationally and operationally of use in more restricted fields of interest. For example, the World University Service of Canada uses the administrative divisions of the Middle East and Europe, and South and Southeast Asia—their definition of &quot;Asia&quot; is substantially different from the wider definition, and the same may apply to other agencies worldwide. Some differing uses of &quot;Asia&quot; have been promulgated by the news media reporting on current events. For example, [[BBC]] News has an Asia-Pacific section, which acquires news from anywhere in [[Australasia]], Oceania or the Pacific side of the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Asia-Pacific | work=BBC Mobile News | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world/asia_pacific/ |publisher=BBC | accessdate=28 July 2011| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20110728014556/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world/asia_pacific/| archivedate= 28 July 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time of [[Herodotus]] a minority of geographers have rejected the three-continent system (Europe, Africa, Asia) on the grounds that there is no or is no substantial physical separation between them.&lt;ref name=McG-H /&gt; For example, Sir [[Barry Cunliffe]], the emeritus professor of European archeology at Oxford, argues that Europe has been geographically and culturally merely &quot;the western excrescence of the continent of Asia&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200812/editors-choice |title=Geography Is Destiny | first=Benjamin | last=Schwartz | journal=The Atlantic |date = December 2008|publisher=Atlantic Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geographically, Asia is the major eastern constituent of the continent of [[Eurasia]] with Europe being a northwestern [[peninsula]] of the landmass – or of [[Afro-Eurasia]]; geologically, Asia, Europe and Africa make up a single continuous landmass (except for the Suez Canal) and share a common [[continental shelf]]. Almost all of Europe and the better part of Asia sit atop the [[Eurasian Plate]], adjoined on the south by the [[Arabian Plate|Arabian]] and [[Indian Plate]] and with the easternmost part of Siberia (east of the [[Chersky Range]]) on the [[North American Plate]].

== Etymology ==
[[File:Gulf5..JPG|thumb|300px|Ptolemy's Asia]]
Asia was originally a concept of [[Greek civilization]].&lt;ref name=&quot;reid&quot;&gt;[[T.R. Reid|Reid, T.R.]] ''[[Confucius Lives Next Door: What living in the East teaches us about living in the west]]'' Vintage Books(1999).&lt;/ref&gt; The place name, &quot;Asia&quot;, in various forms in a large number of modern languages is of unknown ultimate provenience. Its etymology and language of origin are uncertain. It appears to be one of the most ancient of recorded names. A number of theories have been published. English Asia can be traced through the formation of English literature to Latin literature, where it has the same form, Asia. Whether all uses and all forms of the name derive also from the Latin of the [[Roman Empire]] is much less certain.

===Classical antiquity===
Latin Asia and Greek Ἀσία appear to be the same word. Roman authors translated Ἀσία as Asia. The Romans named a province [[Asia (Roman province)]], which roughly corresponds with modern-day [[Anatolia|central-eastern Turkey]]. There was an Asia Minor and an Asia Major located in modern-day [[Iraq]]. As the earliest evidence of the name is Greek, it is likely circumstantially that Asia came from Ἀσία, but ancient transitions, due to the lack of literary contexts, are difficult to catch in the act. The most likely vehicles were the ancient geographers and historians, such as [[Herodotus]], who were all Greek. Roman civilization Hellenized extensively. [[Ancient Greek]] certainly evidences early and rich uses of the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*%29asi%2Fa | title=Ἀσία | author=Henry George Liddell |author2=Robert Scott|author3= Henry Stuart Jones|author4= Roderick McKenzie | encyclopedia=A Greek-English Lexicon | year=2007 | location=Medford | publisher=Perseus Digital Library, Tufts University | origyear=1940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first continental use of Asia is attributed to Herodotus (about 440&amp;nbsp;BC), not because he innovated it, but because his ''Histories'' are the earliest surviving prose to describe it in any detail. He defines it carefully,&lt;ref&gt;Book IV, Articles 37–40.&lt;/ref&gt; mentioning the previous geographers whom he had read, but whose works are now missing. By it he means [[Anatolia]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], in contrast to [[Greece]] and [[Egypt]]. Herodotus comments that he is puzzled as to why three women's names were &quot;given to a tract which is in reality one&quot; ([[Europa (mythology)|Europa]], [[Asia (mythology)|Asia]], and [[Libya (mythology)|Libya]], referring to Africa), stating that most Greeks assumed that Asia was named after the wife of [[Prometheus]] (i.e. [[Hesione]]), but that the [[Lydia]]ns say it was named after Asies, son of Cotys, who passed the name on to a tribe at [[Sardis]].&lt;ref&gt;Book IV, Article 45.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greek mythology]], &quot;Asia&quot; (''Ἀσία'') or &quot;Asie&quot; (''Ἀσίη'') was the name of a &quot;[[Nymph]] or [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] goddess of Lydia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NympheAsie.html | title=Asie | work=Encyclopedia: Greek Gods, Spirits, Monsters | publisher=Theoi Greek Mythology, Exploring Mythology in Classical Literature and Art | date=2000-2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herodotus' geographical puzzlement was perhaps only a form of disagreement, as, having read the earlier Greek poetry along with everyone else literate, he would have known perfectly well why places received female names. Athens, Mycenae, Thebes and many other locations in fact had them. In ancient Greek religion, places were under the care of female divinities, parallel to guardian angels. The poets detailed their doings and generations in allegoric language salted with entertaining stories, which subsequently playwrights transformed into classical Greek drama and became &quot;Greek mythology.&quot;

For example, [[Hesiod]] mentions the daughters of [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]] and [[Oceanus|Ocean]], among whom are a &quot;holy company&quot;, &quot;who with the Lord [[Apollo]] and the Rivers have youths in their keeping.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Theogony'', Line 345 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these are geographic: Doris, Rhodea, Europa, Asia. Hesiod explains:&lt;ref&gt;''Theogony'', Line 364ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;For there are three-thousand neat-ankled daughters of Ocean who are dispersed far and wide, and in every place alike serve the earth and the deep waters.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The [[Iliad]] (attributed by the ancient Greeks to [[Homer]]) mentions two Phrygians (the tribe that replaced the [[Luvians]] in Lydia) in the [[Trojan War]] named [[Asius (mythology)|Asios]] (an adjective meaning &quot;Asian&quot;);&lt;ref&gt;Μ95, Π717.&lt;/ref&gt; and also a marsh or lowland containing a marsh in Lydia as ασιος.&lt;ref&gt;Β461.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bronze Age===
Before Greek poetry, the [[Aegean Sea]] area was in a [[Greek Dark Age]], at the beginning of which syllabic writing was lost and alphabetic writing had not begun. Prior to then in the [[Bronze Age]] the records of the [[Assyrian Empire]], the [[Hittite Empire]] and the various [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] states of Greece mention a region undoubtedly Asia, certainly in Anatolia, including if not identical to Lydia. These records are administrative and do not include poetry.

The Mycenaean states were destroyed about 1200&amp;nbsp;BC by unknown agents although one school of thought assigns the [[Dorian invasion]] to this time. The burning of the palaces baked clay diurnal administrative records written in a Greek syllabic script called [[Linear B]], deciphered by a number of interested parties, most notably by a young World War II cryptographer, [[Michael Ventris]], subsequently assisted by the scholar, [[John Chadwick]]. A major cache discovered by [[Carl Blegen]] at the site of ancient [[Pylos]] included hundreds of male and female names formed by different methods.

Some of these are of women held in servitude (as study of the society implied by the content reveals). They were used in trades, such as cloth-making, and usually came with children. The epithet, lawiaiai, &quot;captives,&quot; associated with some of them identifies their origin. Some are ethnic names. One in particular, aswiai, identifies &quot;women of Asia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ventris|Chadwick|1973|p=536}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps they were captured in Asia, but some others, Milatiai, appear to have been of [[Miletus]], a Greek colony, which would not have been raided for slaves by Greeks. Chadwick suggests that the names record the locations where these foreign women were purchased.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ventris|Chadwick|1973|p=410}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is also in the singular, Aswia, which refers both to the name of a country and to a female of it. There is a masculine form, aswios. This Aswia appears to have been a remnant of a region known to the Hittites as Assuwa, centered on Lydia, or &quot;Roman Asia.&quot; This name, ''Assuwa'', has been suggested as the origin for the name of the continent &quot;Asia&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bossert, Helmut T., ''Asia'', Istanbul, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Assuwa league]] was a confederation of states in western Anatolia, defeated by the [[Hittites]] under [[Tudhaliya I]] around 1400&amp;nbsp;BC.

Alternatively, the [[etymology]] of the term may be from the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] word ''{{Unicode|(w)aṣû(m)}}'', which means 'to go outside' or 'to ascend', referring to the direction of the sun at sunrise in the Middle East and also likely connected with the Phoenician word ''asa'' meaning east. This may be contrasted to a similar etymology proposed for ''Europe'', as being from Akkadian ''erēbu(m)'' 'to enter' or 'set' (of the sun).

[[T.R. Reid]] supports this alternative etymology, noting that the ancient Greek name must have derived from ''asu'', meaning 'east' in [[Assyria]]n (''ereb'' for ''Europe'' meaning 'west').&lt;ref name=&quot;reid&quot;/&gt; The ideas of ''Occidental'' (form [[Latin]] ''Occidens'' 'setting') and ''Oriental'' (from Latin ''Oriens'' for 'rising') are also European invention, synonymous with ''Western'' and ''Eastern''.&lt;ref name=&quot;reid&quot;/&gt; Reid further emphasizes that it explains the Western point of view of placing all the peoples and cultures of Asia into a single classification, almost as if there were a need for setting the distinction between Western and [[Eastern world|Eastern civilizations]] on the [[Eurasia]]n continent.&lt;ref name=&quot;reid&quot;/&gt; Ogura Kazuo and Tenshin Okakura are two outspoken Japanese figures on the subject.&lt;ref name=&quot;reid&quot;/&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Asia}}
[[File:Mongol dominions1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Mongol Empire]], ca. 1300. The gray area is the later [[Timur|Timurid empire]].]][[File:Asien Bd1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|1890 map of Asia]]

The history of Asia can be seen as the distinct histories of several peripheral coastal regions: [[East Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[Middle East]], linked by the interior mass of the Central Asian [[steppe]]s.

The coastal periphery was home to some of the world's earliest known civilizations, each of them developing around fertile river valleys. The civilizations in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Indus Valley]] and the [[Huanghe River|Huanghe]] shared many similarities. These civilizations may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as [[mathematics]] and the wheel. Other innovations, such as writing, seem to have been developed individually in each area. Cities, states and empires developed in these lowlands.

The central steppe region had long been inhabited by horse-mounted nomads who could reach all areas of Asia from the [[steppe]]s. The earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]], who spread their languages into the Middle East, South Asia, and the borders of [[China]], where the [[Tocharians]] resided. The northernmost part of Asia, including much of [[Siberia]], was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads, owing to the dense forests, climate and [[tundra]]. These areas remained very sparsely populated.

[[File:Silkroutes.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Silk Road]] connected many civilizations across Asia&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silk-road.com/artl/srtravelmain.shtml ANCIENT SILK ROAD TRAVELLERS]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The center and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts. The [[Caucasus]] and [[Himalaya]] mountains and the [[Karakum Desert|Karakum]] and [[Gobi Desert|Gobi]] deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty. While the urban city dwellers were more advanced technologically and socially, in many cases they could do little in a military aspect to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe. However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force; for this and other reasons, the [[nomad]]s who conquered states in China, India, and the Middle East often found themselves adapting to the local, more affluent societies.

The Islamic [[Caliphate]] took over the Middle East and Central Asia during the [[Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century. The [[Mongol Empire]] conquered a large part of Asia in the 13th century, an area extending from China to Europe. Before the Mongol invasion, [[Song China]] reportedly had approximately 120 million citizens; the 1300 census which followed the invasion reported roughly 60 million people.&lt;ref&gt;Ping-ti Ho. &quot;An Estimate of the Total Population of Sung-Chin China&quot;, in ''Études Song'', Series 1, No 1, (1970). pp. 33–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Black Death]], one of the most devastating [[pandemic]]s in human history, is thought to have originated in the arid plains of central Asia, where it then travelled along the [[Silk Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/middle_ages/blackdisease_01.shtml|title=BBC – History – Black Death |publisher=BBC |date=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Russian Empire]] began to expand into Asia from the 17th century, and would eventually take control of all of Siberia and most of [[Central Asia]] by the end of the 19th century. The [[Ottoman Empire]] controlled Anatolia, the Middle East, North Africa and the Balkans from the 16th century onwards. In the 17th century, the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] nomads conquered China and established the [[Qing Dynasty]]. In the 16th century, the Islamic [[Mughal Empire]] controlled much of India.

==Geography and climate==
{{main|Geography of Asia|Climate of Asia}}
[[File:Himalaya sud avion.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] range is home to some of the planet's highest peaks.]]
Asia is the largest [[continent]] on Earth. It covers 8.8% of the Earth's total surface area (or 30% of its land area), and has the largest coastline, at {{convert|62800|km|mi|0}}. Asia is generally defined as comprising the eastern four-fifths of [[Eurasia]]. It is located to the east of the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Ural Mountains]], and south of the [[Caucasus Mountains]] (or the [[Kuma–Manych Depression]]) and the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Black Sea]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Asia | url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110518/Asia | encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Online | year=2006 | location=Chicago | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is bounded on the east by the [[Pacific Ocean]], on the south by the [[Indian Ocean]] and on the north by the [[Arctic Ocean]]. Asia is subdivided into 48 countries, two of them ([[Russia]] and [[Turkey]]) having part of their land in Europe.

Asia has extremely diverse climates and geographic features. Climates range from arctic and subarctic in Siberia to tropical in southern India and Southeast Asia. It is moist across southeast sections, and dry across much of the interior. Some of the largest daily temperature ranges on Earth occur in western sections of Asia. The monsoon circulation dominates across southern and eastern sections, due to the presence of the Himalayas forcing the formation of a thermal low which draws in moisture during the summer. Southwestern sections of the continent are hot. Siberia is one of the coldest places in the Northern Hemisphere, and can act as a source of arctic air masses for North America. The most active place on Earth for tropical cyclone activity lies northeast of the Philippines and south of Japan. The [[Gobi Desert]] is in [[Mongolia]] and the [[Arabian Desert]] stretches across much of the Middle East. The [[Yangtze River]] in China is the longest river in the continent. The [[Himalayas]] between Nepal and China is the tallest mountain range in the world. Tropical rainforests stretch across much of southern Asia and coniferous and deciduous forests lie farther north.

===Climate change===

A survey carried out in 2010 by global risk analysis firm [[Maplecroft]] identified 16 countries that are extremely vulnerable to climate change. Each nation's vulnerability was calculated using 42 socio, economic and environmental indicators, which identified the likely climate change impacts during the next 30 years. The Asian countries of [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Sri Lanka]] were among the 16 countries facing extreme risk from climate change. Some shifts are already occurring. For example, in tropical parts of India with a [[semi-arid climate]], the temperature increased by 0.4°C between 1901 and 2003.
A 2013 study by the [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]) aimed to find science-based, pro-poor approaches and techniques that would enable Asia's agricultural systems to cope with climate change, while benefitting poor and vulnerable farmers. The study's recommendations ranged from improving the use of climate information in local planning and strengthening weather-based agro-advisory services, to stimulating diversification of rural household incomes and providing incentives to farmers to adopt natural resource conservation measures to enhance forest cover, replenish groundwater and use [[renewable energy]].&lt;ref&gt; [http://exploreit.icrisat.org/sites/default/files/uploads/1378286859_PolicyBrief23.pdf ''Vulnerability to Climate Change: Adaptation Strategies and layers of Resilience''], [[ICRISAT]], Policy Brief No. 23, February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

For several decades in the late twentieth century Japan was the largest economy in Asia and second-largest of any single nation in the world, after surpassing the [[Soviet Union]] (measured in net material product) in 1986 and Germany in 1968. (NB: A number of supernational economies are larger, such as the [[European Union]] (EU), the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) or [[APEC]]). This ended in 2010 when China overtook Japan to become the world's second largest economy.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Japan's GDP was almost as large (current exchange rate method) as that of the rest of Asia combined.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} In 1995, Japan's economy nearly equaled that of the USA as the largest economy in the world for a day, after the Japanese currency reached a record high of 79 [[Japanese yen|yen]]/US$.

Several trade blocs exist, with the most developed being the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]].

Asia is the largest continent in the world by a considerable margin, and it is rich in natural resources, such as petroleum, forests, fish, water, rice, copper and silver. Manufacturing in Asia has traditionally been strongest in East and Southeast Asia, particularly in the [[China]], [[Taiwan]], [[South Korea]], [[Japan]], India, the [[Philippines]], and [[Singapore]]. Japan and South Korea continue to dominate in the area of [[multinational corporation]]s, but increasingly the PRC and India are making significant inroads. Many companies from Europe, North America, South Korea and Japan have operations in Asia's developing countries to take advantage of its abundant supply of cheap labour and relatively developed infrastructure.

[[East Asia]] had by far the strongest overall [[Human Development Index]] (HDI) improvement of any region in the world, nearly doubling average HDI attainment over the past 40 years, according to the report’s analysis of health, education and income data. China, the second highest achiever in the world in terms of HDI improvement since
1970, is the only country on the &quot;Top 10 Movers&quot; list due to income rather than health or education achievements. Its per capita income increased a stunning 21-fold over the last four decades, also lifting hundreds of millions out of income poverty. Yet it was not among the region’s top performers in improving school enrolment and life expectancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNDP&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/PR6-HDR10-RegRBAP-E-rev5-sm.pdf |title=2010 Human Development Report: Asian countries lead development progress over 40 years |publisher=UNDP |accessdate=2010-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;[[Nepal]], a South Asian country, emerges as one of the world’s fastest movers since 1970 mainly due to health and education achievements. Its present [[life expectancy]] is 25 years longer than in the 1970s. More than four of every five children of school age in Nepal now attend primary school, compared to just one in five 40 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNDP&quot;/&gt;

[[Afghanistan]] (155) ranked lowest amongst Asian countries out of the 169 countries assessed.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNDP&quot;/&gt;

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Asia}}
Asia is home to several [[language family|language families]] and many [[language isolate]]s. Most Asian countries have more than one language that is natively spoken. For instance, according to [[Ethnologue]], more than 600 languages are spoken in Indonesia, more than 800 languages spoken in India, and more than 100 are spoken in the Philippines. China has many languages and dialects in different provinces.

=== Religions ===

Many of the world's [[major religious groups|major religions]] have their origins in Asia. Asian mythology is complex and diverse. The story of the Great Flood for example, as presented to Christians in the Old Testament, is first found in [[Mesopotamian mythology]], in the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''. [[Hindu mythology]] tells about an [[Avatar]] of the [[Vishnu|God Vishnu]] in the form of a [[Matsya|fish]] who warned [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]] of a terrible flood. In ancient [[Chinese mythology]], [[Shan Hai Jing]], the Chinese ruler [[King Yu of Xia of China|Da Yu]], had to spend 10 years to control a deluge which swept out most of ancient China and was aided by the goddess [[Nüwa]] who literally fixed the broken sky through which huge rains were pouring.

==== Abrahamic ====
The [[Abrahamic religions]] of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Bahá'í Faith]] originated in West Asia. [[Judaism]], the oldest of the Abrahamic faiths, is practiced primarily in [[Israel]] (the birthplace and historical homeland of the Jewish people, whose Jewish population today consists equally of those Israelites who remained in [[Mizrahi Jews|Asia/North Africa]] and those who returned from exile in the European [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/jewpop.html |title=The Jewish Population of the World |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; though small communities exist in other countries, such as the [[Bene Israel]] in India.

[[Christianity]] is also present throughout Asia. In the Philippines and [[East Timor]], Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion; it was introduced by the [[Spain|Spaniards]] and the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], respectively. In [[Armenia]], Cyprus, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and Asian Russia, [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] is the predominant religion. Various Christian [[Christian denomination|denominations]] have adherents in portions of the Middle East, as well as China and India.

[[Islam]], which originated in [[Saudi Arabia]], is the largest and most widely spread religion in Asia. With 12.7% of the world Muslim population, the country currently with the largest Muslim population in the world is [[Indonesia]], followed by [[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]]. [[Mecca]], [[Medina]] and to a lesser extent [[Jerusalem]] are the holiest cities for Islam in all the world. These religious sites attract large numbers of devotees from all over the world, particularly during the [[Hajj]] and [[Umrah]] seasons. [[Iran]] is the largest [[Shi'a]] country.

The [[Bahá'í Faith]] originated in Asia, in Iran (Persia), and spread from there to the Ottoman Empire, Central Asia, India, and Burma during the lifetime of Bahá'u'lláh. Since the middle of the 20th century, growth has particularly occurred in other Asian countries, because Bahá'í activities in many Muslim countries has been severely [[Persecution of Bahá'ís|suppressed]] by authorities. [[Lotus Temple]] is a big Baha'i Temple in India.

==== Dharmic and East Asian religions ====

Almost all Asian religions have philosophical character and Asian philosophical traditions cover a large spectrum of philosophical thoughts and writings. [[Indian philosophy]] includes [[Hindu philosophy]] and [[Buddhist philosophy]]. They include elements of nonmaterial pursuits, whereas another school of thought from India, [[Cārvāka]], preached the enjoyment of the material world. The religions of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]] originated in India, South Asia. In East Asia, particularly in China and Japan, [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Zen|Zen Buddhism]] took shape.

As of 2012, Hinduism has around 1.1 billion adherents. The faith represents around 25% of Asia's population and is the second largest religion in Asia. However, it is mostly concentrated in South Asia. Over 80% of the populations of both India and Nepal adhere to Hinduism, alongside significant communities in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and [[Bali]], Indonesia. Many overseas Indians in countries such as Burma, Singapore and Malaysia also adhere to Hinduism.

'''Aruba''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|r|uː|b|ə}} {{respell|ə|ROO|bə}}; {{IPA-nl|aˈruba}}) is an island 33 kilometre long (20&amp;nbsp;mi) located about {{convert|1600|km}} west of the [[Lesser Antilles]] in the southern [[Caribbean Sea]], located {{convert|27|km|0}} north of the coast of [[Venezuela]]. Together with [[Bonaire]] and [[Curaçao]], it forms a group referred to as the [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]]. Collectively, Aruba and the other [[Dutch Caribbean|Dutch islands in the Caribbean]] are often called the [[Netherlands Antilles]] or the [[Dutch Caribbean]].

Aruba is one of the four [[Constituent country|constituent countries]] that form the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], along with the [[Netherlands]], [[Curaçao]] and [[Sint Maarten]]. The citizens of these countries all share a single nationality: Dutch. Aruba has no administrative subdivisions, but, for census purposes, is divided into eight regions. Its capital is [[Oranjestad, Aruba|Oranjestad]].

Unlike much of the Caribbean region, Aruba has a dry climate and an arid, [[cactus]]-strewn landscape. This climate has helped tourism as visitors to the island can reliably expect warm, sunny weather. It has a land area of {{convert|179|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}} and is densely populated, with a total of 102,484 inhabitants at the 2010 Census. It lies outside the [[hurricane belt]].

== History ==
{{main|History of Aruba}}

Aruba's first inhabitants are thought to have been [[Caquetios Indian|Caquetíos Amerinds]] from the [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] tribe, who migrated there from [[Venezuela]] to escape attacks by the [[Caribs]]. Fragments of the earliest known Indian settlements date back to 1000 AD. As sea currents made [[canoe]] travel to other [[Caribbean islands]] difficult, [[Caquetio]] culture remained more closely associated with that of mainland South America.

[[File:Oranjestad.jpg|thumb|upright=1.30|The capital [[Oranjestad, Aruba|Oranjestad]]]]

Europeans first learned of Aruba following the explorations for Spain by [[Amerigo Vespucci]] and [[Alonso de Ojeda]] in the summer of 1499. Though Vespucci boasted of discovering the island, Ojeda was likely first, learning of it from natives of nearby islands.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Both described Aruba as an &quot;island of giants&quot;, remarking on the comparatively large stature of the native Caquetíos compared to Europeans. Ojeda also referred to the island as ''Oro Hubo,'' Spanish for &quot;It had gold&quot;. Gold was not discovered on Aruba, however, for another 300 years. Vespucci returned to Spain with stocks of cotton and [[Caesalpinia echinata|brazilwood]] from the island and described houses built into the ocean. Vespucci and Ojeda's tales spurred interest in Aruba, and Spaniards soon colonized the island.&lt;ref name=advent&gt;{{cite book |last=Sullivan| first=Lynne M.| year=2006| title=Adventure Guide to Aruba, Bonaire &amp; Curaçao| publisher=Hunter Publishing, Inc.| location=Edison, NJ| pages=57–58| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M8SyFOyvjkQC&amp;lpg=PA58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=early&gt;{{cite book | last=Sauer| first=Carl Ortwin| year=1966| title=The Early Spanish Main| publisher=Cambridge University Press| location=Cambridge| page=112| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=plzS7SL_-f0C&amp;lpg=PA112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it had low rainfall, Aruba was not considered profitable for the plantation system and the economics of the [[slave trade]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Aruba was colonized by [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] for over a century. ''Simas,'' the ''[[Cacique]]'' or [[Tribal chief|chief]] in Aruba, welcomed the first Catholic priests in Aruba, who gave him a wooden cross as a gift. In 1508, the Spanish Crown appointed Alonso de Ojeda as its first Governor of Aruba, as part of ''Nueva Andalucía.''

Arawaks spoke the &quot;broken Spanish&quot; which their ancestors had learned on Hispaniola.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Another governor appointed by Spain was [[Juan Martínez de Ampiés]]. A ''cédula real'' decreed in November 1525 gave Ampíes, factor of Española, the right to repopulate Aruba. In 1528, Ampíes was replaced by a representative of the [[Welser|House of Welser]].

The Netherlands have covered the island with their regulations since 1629. Since 1636, Aruba has been under [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] administration, initially governed by [[Peter Stuyvesant]], later appointed to [[New Amsterdam]] (New York City). Stuyvesant was on a special mission in Aruba in November and December 1642. The island was included under the Dutch [[Dutch West India Company]] (W.I.C.) administration, as &quot;New Netherland and Curaçao,&quot; from 1648 to 1664. In 1667 the Dutch administration appointed an Irishman as &quot;Commandeur&quot; in Aruba.

The Dutch took control 135 years after the Spanish, leaving the Arawaks to farm and graze livestock, and used the island as a source of meat for other Dutch possessions in the Caribbean.{{citation needed|reason=no direct linkage has been supplied to demonstrate that one lead to the other|date=August 2012}}

In August 1806, General [[Francisco de Miranda]] and a group of 200 freedom fighters, traveling to liberate Venezuela from Spain, stayed in Aruba for several weeks.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In 1933, Aruba sent its first petition to the Queen seeking independent status and autonomy.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

During [[World War II]], Aruba was one of the main suppliers of refined petroleum products to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. During the war, after the [[German occupation of the Netherlands]], Aruba was made a British [[protectorate]] from 1940 to 1942, and a US protectorate from 1942 to 1945.

On 16 February 1942, a German submarine (''[[German submarine U-156 (1941)|U-156]]'') under the command of Werner Hartenstein attacked the island's oil processing refinery, but the mission failed.

In March 1944, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], the [[First Lady of the United States]], briefly visited American troops stationed in Aruba. In attendance were Curaçao Governor P. Kasteel, and U.S. Rear Admiral [[Theodore E. Chandler|T. E. Chandler]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

=== Move towards independence ===
In August 1947, Aruba presented its first ''Staatsreglement'' (constitution), for Aruba's ''[[status aparte]]'' as an autonomous state within the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. By 1954, the [[Charter of the Kingdom of the Netherlands]] was established, providing a framework for relations between Aruba and the rest of the Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Robbers|first=Gerhard|title=Encyclopedia of World Constitutions|publisher=Facts on File, Inc.|volume=1|year=2007|location=New York City|page=649|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M3A-xgf1yM4C&amp;lpg=PA649|isbn=0-8160-6078-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, at a conference in [[Suriname]], [[Betico Croes]] (MEP), a politician from Aruba, proposed a ''sui-generis'' Dutch Commonwealth of four states: Aruba, the Netherlands, Suriname and the [[Netherlands Antilles]], each to have its own nationality. C. Yarzagaray, a parliamentary member representing the AVP political party, proposed a [[referendum]] so that the people of Aruba could choose whether they wanted total independence or ''Status Aparte'' as a full autonomous state under the Crown.

Croes worked in Aruba to inform and prepare the people of Aruba for independence. In 1976, he appointed a committee that chose the national flag and anthem, introducing them as symbols of Aruba's sovereignty and independence. He set 1981 as a target date for independence. In March 1977, the first Referendum for Self Determination was held with the support of the United Nations; 82% of the participants voted for independence.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The Island Government of Aruba assigned the Institute of Social Studies in [[The Hague]] to prepare a study for independence; it was titled ''Aruba en Onafhankelijkheid, achtergronden, modaliteiten en mogelijkheden; een rapport in eerste aanleg'' (Aruba and independence, backgrounds, modalities and opportunities; a preliminary report) (1978). At the conference in The Hague in 1981, Aruba's independence was set for the year 1991.

In March 1983, Aruba reached an official agreement within the Kingdom for its independence, to be developed in a series of steps as the Crown granted increasing autonomy. In August 1985 Aruba drafted a constitution that was unanimously approved. On 1 January 1986, after elections were held for its first parliament, Aruba seceded from the Netherlands Antilles; it officially became a country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Full independence was projected in 1996.

After his death in 1986, Croes was proclaimed ''Libertador di Aruba''. At a convention in The Hague in 1990, at the request of Aruba's [[Nelson Oduber|Prime Minister]], the governments of Aruba, the Netherlands, and the Netherlands Antilles postponed indefinitely its transition to full independence. The article scheduling Aruba's complete independence was rescinded in 1995, although the process could be revived after another referendum.

Aruba is a generally flat, riverless island in the [[Leeward Antilles]] island arc of the [[Lesser Antilles]] in the southern part of the Caribbean. It has white sandy beaches on the western and southern coasts of the island, relatively sheltered from fierce ocean currents.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} This is where most tourist development has occurred.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} The northern and eastern coasts, lacking this protection, are considerably more battered by the sea and have been left largely untouched by humans.

The hinterland of the island features some rolling hills, the best known of which are called [[Hooiberg]] at {{convert|165|m|ft|0|sp=us}} and [[Mount Jamanota]], the highest on the island at {{convert|188|m|ft|0|sp=us}} above sea level. Oranjestad, the capital, is located at {{Coord|12|19|N|70|1|W|}}.

To the east of Aruba are [[Bonaire]] and [[Curaçao]], two island territories which once formed the southwest part of the [[Netherlands Antilles]]. This group of islands is sometimes called the [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]].

The [[Aruba Natural Bridge|Natural Bridge]] was a large, naturally formed limestone bridge on the island's north shore. It was a popular tourist destination until its collapse in 2005.

== Demographics ==
{{Main|Demographics of Aruba}}

[[File:Aruba-demography.png|thumb|upright=1.60|Population of Aruba 1961–2003, according to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] in 2005; number of inhabitants given in thousands.]]

The population is estimated to be 80% mixed Black/White/Caribbean Amerindian and 20% other ethnicities.

The Arawak heritage is stronger on Aruba than on most Caribbean islands. Although no full-blooded [[Native American (Americas)|Aboriginals]] remain, the features of the islanders clearly indicate their genetic [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] heritage. Most of the population is descended mostly from Arawak, and to a lesser extent Spanish, Italian, Dutch, and a few French, Portuguese, British, and African ancestors.

Recently, there has been substantial immigration to the island from neighboring American and Caribbean nations, possibly attracted by the higher paid jobs. In 2007, new immigration laws were introduced to help control the growth of the population by restricting [[foreign worker]]s to a maximum of three years residency on the island.

Demographically, Aruba has felt the impact of its proximity to Venezuela. Many of Aruba's families are descended from Venezuelan immigrants. There is a seasonal increase of Venezuelans living in second homes.

=== Language ===
{{main|Languages of Aruba}}
Language can be seen as an important part of island culture in Aruba. The official languages are [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and – since 2003 – [[Papiamento]]. Papiamento is the predominant language on Aruba. A [[creole language]] spoken on Aruba, [[Bonaire]], and [[Curaçao]], it incorporates words from other languages including Portuguese, West African languages, Dutch, and Spanish. English is known by many; its usage has grown due to tourism. Other common languages spoken based on the size of their community are Portuguese, Chinese, German, Spanish, and French.

In recent years, the government of Aruba has shown an increased interest in acknowledging the cultural and historical importance of its native language. Although spoken Papiamento is fairly similar among the several Papiamento-speaking islands, there is a big difference in written Papiamento. The orthography differs per island and even per group of people. Some are more oriented towards Portuguese and use the equivalent spelling (e.g. &quot;y&quot; instead of &quot;j&quot;), where others are more oriented towards Dutch.

The book ''The Buccaneers of America'', first published in 1678, states through eyewitness account that the Indians on Aruba spoke &quot;Spanish&quot;. The oldest government official statement written in Papiamento dates from 1803. Around 12.6% of the population today speaks Spanish.&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{cite web |author=Central Intelligence Agency |authorlink=Central Intelligence Agency |publisher=[[The World Factbook]]|title=Aruba |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aa.html |year=2009|accessdate=2011-06-06| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110604234830/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aa.html| archivedate= 4 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aruba has four newspapers published in Papiamento: ''Diario'', ''Bon Dia'', ''Solo di Pueblo'' and ''Awe Mainta''; and two in English: ''Aruba Today'' and ''The News''. ''Amigoe'' is the newspaper published in Dutch. Aruba also has 18 radio stations (two AM and 16 FM) and three local television stations (Tele-Aruba, Aruba Broadcast Company and Channel 22).

=== Regions ===
For census purposes, Aruba is divided into eight regions, which have no administrative functions:

== Government ==
{{main|Politics of Aruba}}

[[File:Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange.jpg|thumb|[[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|King Willem-Alexander]] is the [[head of state]] of Aruba]]
[[File:Parlamento di Aruba (front).jpg|thumb|Parliament of Aruba in [[Oranjestad, Aruba|Oranjestad]].]]
As a [[constituent country]] of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], Aruba's politics take place within a framework of a 21-member [[parliamentary democracy|Parliament]] and an eight-member Cabinet. The [[governor of Aruba]] is appointed for a six-year term by the monarch, and the prime minister and deputy prime minister are elected by the Staten (or &quot;Parlamento&quot;) for four-year terms. The Staten is made up of 21 members elected by direct, popular vote to serve a four-year term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arubaforeignaffairs.com/afa/readBlob.do?id=694|title=Political Stability|accessdate=2011-06-07 |work= |publisher=Aruba Department of Foreign Affairs|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with the [[Netherlands]], the countries of Aruba, [[Curaçao]] and [[Sint Maarten]] form the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. As they share the same Dutch citizenship, these four countries still also share the Dutch passport as the Kingdom of the Netherlands passport. As Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten have small populations, the three countries had to limit immigration. To protect their population, they have the right to control the admission and expulsion of people from the Netherlands.

Aruba is designated as a member of the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT) and is thus officially not a part of the [[European Union]], though Aruba can and does receive support from the European Development Fund.&lt;ref name=euprofile&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eeas.europa.eu/aruba/index_en.htm |title=EU Relations with Aruba |accessdate=2011-06-06 |work= |publisher=European Union |date= | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110609050531/http://eeas.europa.eu/aruba/index_en.htm| archivedate= 9 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/development/overseas_countries_territories/index_en.htm |title=Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT) |accessdate=2011-06-06 |work= |publisher=European Union |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics ===
The Aruban legal system is based on the Dutch model. Instead of juries or grand juries, in Aruba, legal jurisdiction lies with the ''Gerecht in Eerste Aanleg'' ([[Court of First Instance]]) on Aruba, the ''Gemeenschappelijk Hof van Justitie van Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten en van Bonaire, Sint Eustatius en Saba'' ([[Joint Court of Justice of Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten, and of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba]]) and the ''[[Hoge Raad der Nederlanden]]'' (Supreme Court of Justice of the Netherlands).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aruba.com/ExploretheIsland/IslandFacts/law.aspx Aruba.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Korps Politie Aruba'' ([[Aruba Police Force]]) is the island's law enforcement agency and operates district precincts in Oranjestad, Noord, San Nicolaas, and Santa Cruz, where it is headquartered.&lt;ref name=&quot;KPA-districts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kparuba.com/districts.html|title=Korps Politie Aruba: district precincts|publisher=Aruba Police Force|accessdate=2010-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deficit spending]] has been a staple in Aruba's history, and modestly high inflation has been present as well. As of 2006, the government's debt had grown to 1.883 billion Aruban florins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Central Bureau of Statistics|title=Key Indicators General Government, 1997–2006|url=http://www.cbs.aw/cbs/manageDocument.do?dispatch=view&amp;id=927|accessdate=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aruba received some [[development aid]] from the Dutch government each year through 2009, as part of a deal (signed as &quot;Aruba's Financial Independence&quot;) in which the Netherlands gradually reduced its financial help to the island each successive year.

In 2006, the Aruban government changed several tax laws to reduce the deficit. [[Direct tax]]es have been converted to indirect taxes as proposed by the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]. A 3% tax has been introduced on sales and services, while income taxes have been lowered and revenue taxes for business reduced by 20%. The government compensated workers with 3.1% for the effect that the B.B.O. would have on the inflation for 2007.

== Education ==
Aruba's educational system is patterned after the [[Education in the Netherlands|Dutch system of education]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The Government of Aruba finances the national education system. Private schools, such as the International School of Aruba (ISA), finance their own activities. The percentage of money earmarked for education is higher than the average for the Caribbean/Latin American region.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Arubans have a primary school system, followed by a segmented secondary school program which includes vocational training, basic education, college preparation and advanced placement.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The study of Spanish, English, Dutch and French is offered in secondary school and college, since a high percentage of students continue their studies in Europe.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Higher education is available through the Professional Education program (EPI), the teachers college (IPA) as well as through the University of Aruba (UA) which offers bachelors and masters programs in law, finance and economics and hospitality and tourism management. Since the choice for higher education on the island itself is limited, many students choose study in the Netherlands, or abroad in countries in North America, South America as well as the rest of Europe.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Aruba is also home to two [[medical schools]]: [[Aureus University School of Medicine]] and [[Xavier University School of Medicine]].

== Economy ==
{{Main|Economy of Aruba}}

Aruba has one of the highest standards of living in the Caribbean region. There is a low unemployment rate.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The GDP per capita for Aruba was estimated to be $21,800 in 2004; among the highest in the Caribbean and the Americas.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; Its main trading partners are [[Venezuela]], the United States and the [[Netherlands]].

[[File:Aruba export map.png|thumb|upright=1.70|A graphical breakdown of Aruba's economy by exports]]
The island's economy has been dominated by five main industries: tourism, [[gold mining]], [[phosphate]] mining (The Aruba Phosphaat Maatschappij), [[aloe]] export, and [[Oil refinery|petroleum refining]] (The Lago Oil and Transport Company and the Arend Petroleum Maatschappij Shell Co.).{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Before the &quot;Status Aparte&quot; (a separate completely autonomous country/state within the Kingdom), oil processing was the dominant industry in Aruba despite expansion of the tourism sector. Today, the influence of the oil processing business is minimal. The size of the agriculture and manufacturing sectors also remains minimal.

The inflation on Aruba in 2007 was 8.7%.

The official exchange rate of the [[Aruban florin]] is pegged to the US dollar at 1.79 florins to 1 USD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.currency.me.uk/convert/usd/awg]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://themoneyconverter.com/USD/AWG.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---note that currency fluctuates slightly because of the necessity of forcing the florin to the dollar by buying or selling florins or dollars---&gt; Because of this fact, and due to a large number of American tourists, many businesses operate using US dollars instead of florins, especially in the hotel and resort districts.

===Tourism===
About three quarters of the Aruban [[gross national product]] is earned through tourism or related activities.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Most tourists are from the United States (predominantly from the north-east US), the Netherlands and South-America, mainly Venezuela and Colombia.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

As part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, citizens of (mainland) the Netherlands can travel with relative ease to Aruba and other islands of the Dutch Antilles. No visas are needed for Dutch citizens, only a passport, and although the currency used in Aruba is different (the Netherlands has the Euro), Euros are still not widely accepted but can be  easily exchanged at a local bank for Aruban Florins.

For the facilitation of the passengers whose destination is the United States, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS), [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP) full pre-clearance facility in Aruba has been in effect since 1 February 2001 with the expansion in the Queen Beatrix Airport. United States and Aruba have had the agreement since 1986. It began as a USDA and Customs post. Since 2008, Aruba has been the only island to have this service for private flights.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Military===
In 1999, the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] established a [[Forward Operating Site|Forward Operating Location]] (FOL) at the airport.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

There is also a small Dutch marines base by Savaneta containing approximately 200 Dutch Marines and about 100 AruMil forces.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

== Culture ==
{{Main|Culture of Aruba}}
{{See also|Music of Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles}}

[[File:Centrum Oranjestad.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.30|Ornate buildings in [[Oranjestad, Aruba]].]]
On 18 March, Aruba celebrates its National Day. In 1976, Aruba presented its National Anthem (Aruba Dushi Tera) and Flag.

Aruba has a varied culture. According to the ''Bureau Burgelijke Stand en Bevolkingsregister'' (BBSB), as of 2005 there are ninety-two different nationalities living on the island. Dutch influence can still be seen, as in the celebration of &quot;[[Sinterklaas]]&quot; on 5 and 6 December and other national holidays like 30 April, when in Aruba and the rest of the Kingdom of the Netherlands the Queen's birthday or &quot;Dia di La Reina&quot; ([[Koninginnedag]]) is celebrated.
[[File:Iguanas Aruba.JPG|left|thumb|[[Iguana]]s on a rooftop in Aruba.]]

Christmas and [[New Year's Eve]] are celebrated with the typical music and songs for [[Gaita flutes|gaita]]s for Christmas and the Dande{{clarify|date=November 2012}} for New Year, and the &quot;[[Hallaca|ayaca]]&quot;, &quot;[[ponche crema]],&quot; ham, and other typical foods and drinks. Millions of florins worth of [[fireworks]] are burnt at midnight on New Year's Eve. On 25 January, [[Betico Croes]]' birthday is celebrated. [[St John's Eve|Dia di San Juan]] is celebrated on June 24.

Besides Christmas, the religious holy days of the [[Feast of the Ascension]] and [[Good Friday]] are holidays on the island.

The holiday of [[Carnival|Carnaval]] is also an important one in Aruba, as it is in many Caribbean and Latin American countries, and, like [[Mardi Gras]], that goes on for weeks. Its celebration in Aruba started, around the 1950s, influenced by the inhabitants from the nearby islands (Venezuela, St Vincent, Trinidad, Barbados, St. Maarten and Anguilla) who came to work for the Oil refinery. Over the years the Carnival Celebration has changed and now starts from the beginning of January till the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday with a large parade on the last Sunday of the festivities (Sunday before Ash Wednesday).

Tourism from the United States has recently increased the visibility of American culture on the island, with such celebrations as [[Halloween]] and Thanksgiving Day in November.

== Infrastructure ==
Aruba's [[Queen Beatrix International Airport]] is located near Oranjestad. According to the Aruba Airport Authority, almost 1.7 million travelers used the airport in 2005, 61% of whom were Americans.

Aruba has two ports, Barcadera and Playa, which are located in Oranjestad. The Port of Playa services all the cruise-ship lines, including [[Royal Caribbean International|Royal Caribbean]], [[Carnival Cruise Lines]], [[Norwegian Cruise Line|NCL]], [[Holland America Line]], [[Disney Cruise Line]] and others. Nearly one million tourists enter this port per year. Aruba Ports Authority, owned and operated by the Aruban government, runs these seaports.

Arubus is a government-owned bus company. Its buses operate from 3:30&amp;nbsp;am until 12:30&amp;nbsp;am 365 days a year. Small private vans also provide transportation services in certain areas such Hotel Area, San Nicolaas, Santa Cruz and Noord.

There are two telecommunications providers: [[SetarNV|Setar]], a government-based company, and [[Digicel]], which is privately owned. Setar is the provider of services such as internet, video conferencing, [[GSM]] wireless technology and land lines.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} [[Digicel]] is Setar's competitor in wireless technology using the GSM platform.

The '''Articles of Confederation''', formally the '''Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union''', was an agreement among the 13 founding states that established the United States of America as a [[confederation]] of sovereign states and served as its first constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Jensen| first = Merrill| title = The Articles of Confederation: An Interpretation of the Social-Constitutional History of the American Revolution, 1774–1781| year = 1959| publisher = University of Wisconsin Press| isbn = 978-0-299-00204-6| pages = xi, 184 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its drafting by the [[Continental Congress]] began in mid-1776, and an approved version was sent to the states for ratification in late 1777. The formal ratification by all 13 states was completed in early 1781. Even when not yet ratified, the Articles provided domestic and international legitimacy for the Continental Congress to direct the [[American Revolutionary War]], conduct diplomacy with Europe and deal with territorial issues and Native American relations. Nevertheless, the weakness of the government created by the Articles became a matter of concern for key [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|nationalists]]. On March 4, 1789, general government under the Articles was replaced with the federal government under the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Rodgers| first = Paul| title = United States Constitutional Law: An Introduction| url = http://books.google.com/?id=WUOXmAEACAAJ&amp;pg=PA109| year = 2011| publisher = McFarland| isbn = 978-0-7864-6017-5| page = 109 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Owings v. Speed |vol= 18 |reporter= U.S. |opinion= 420 |pinpoint= |court= U.S. |date= 1820 |url= http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Owings_v._Speed/Opinion_of_the_Court}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Constitution provided for a much stronger federal government with a chief executive (the president), courts, and taxing powers.

==Background and context==
The political push to increase cooperation among the then-loyal colonies began with the [[Albany Congress]] in 1754 and [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s proposed [[Albany Plan|intercolonial collaboration]] to help solve mutual local problems themselves; the Articles of Confederation would bear some resemblance to it. Over the next two decades, some of the basic concepts it addressed would strengthen and others would weaken, particularly the degree of deserved loyalty to the crown. With [[Boston Tea Party|civil disobedience]] resulting in coercive and [[Intolerable Acts|intolerable acts]], and [[Battle of Bunker Hill|armed conflict]] resulting in dissidents being [[Proclamation of Rebellion|proclaimed rebels]] and outside the King's protection, any loyalty remaining shifted toward independence and how to achieve it. In 1775, with events outpacing communications, the [[Second Continental Congress]] began acting as the [[provisional government]] to run the [[American Revolutionary War]] and gain the colonies their collective independence.

It was an era of constitution writing—most states were busy at the task—and leaders felt the new nation must have a written constitution, even though other nations did not. During the war, Congress exercised an unprecedented level of political, diplomatic, military and economic authority. It adopted trade restrictions, established and maintained an army, issued fiat money, created a military code and negotiated with foreign governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Wood| first = Gordon S.| title = The Creation of the American Republic: 1776–1787| year = 1969| publisher = University of North Carolina Press| pages = 354–55 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To transform themselves from outlaws into a legitimate nation,  the colonists needed international recognition for their cause and foreign allies to support it. In early 1776, [[Thomas Paine]] argued in the closing pages of the first edition of ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' that the “custom of nations” demanded a formal declaration of American independence if any European power were to mediate a peace between the Americans and Great Britain. The monarchies of France and Spain in particular could not be expected to aid those they considered rebels against another legitimate monarch. Foreign courts needed to have American grievances laid before them persuasively in a “manifesto” which could also reassure them that the Americans would be reliable trading partners. Without such a declaration, Paine concluded, “[t]he custom of all courts is against us, and will be so, until, by an independence, we take rank with other nations.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Paine| first = Thomas| editor-last = Foner| editor-first = Eric| editor-link = Eric Foner| title = Paine: Collected Writings| year = 1995| publisher = The Library of America| location = New York| isbn = 978-1-4286-2200-5| pages = 45–6| chapter = Common Sense| date = January 14, 1776 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond improving their existing [[Continental Association|association]], the records of the [[Second Continental Congress]] show that the need for a declaration of independence was intimately linked with the demands of international relations. On June 7, 1776, [[Richard Henry Lee]] introduced a resolution before the Continental Congress declaring the colonies independent; at the same time he also urged Congress to resolve “to take the most effectual measures for forming foreign Alliances” and to prepare a plan of confederation for the newly independent states. Congress then created three overlapping committees to draft the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration]], a [[Model Treaty]], and the Articles of Confederation. The Declaration announced the states' entry into the international system; the model treaty was designed to establish amity and commerce with other states; and the Articles of Confederation, which established “a firm league” among the thirteen free and independent states, constituted an international agreement to set up central institutions for the conduct of vital domestic and foreign affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author-link= David Armitage (historian) |first= David |last=  Armitage |url= http://maghis.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/3/61.full |title= The Declaration of Independence in World Context |publisher= [[Organization of American Historians]] |journal= Magazine of History |volume= 18 |issue= 3 |pages= 61–66 |year= 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drafting==
[[File:Articles of Confederation 1977 Issue-13c.jpg|thumb|220px|&lt;center&gt;Articles of Confederation 200th Anniversary commemorative stamp&lt;/center&gt;&lt;center&gt;First issued in York, Penn., 1977&lt;/center&gt;]]
On June 12, 1776, a day after appointing a committee to prepare a draft of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], the Second Continental Congress resolved to appoint a committee of 13 to prepare a draft of a constitution for a union of the states.  The committee  met repeatedly, and chairman John Dickinson presented their results to the Congress on July 12, 1776.  There were long debates on such issues as sovereignty, the exact powers to be given the confederate government, whether to have a judiciary, and voting procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Jensen |title= Articles of Confederation |pages= 127–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The final draft of the Articles was prepared in the summer of 1777 and the Second Continental Congress approved them for ratification by the individual states on November 15, 1777, after a year of debate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwarz&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/1/2006_1_72.shtml |first= Frederic D. |last= Schwarz |title= 225 Years Ago |journal= American Heritage |date= February–March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In practice, the Articles were in use beginning in 1777;  the final draft of the Articles served as the [[de facto]] system of government used by the Congress (&quot;the United States in Congress assembled&quot;) until it became [[de jure]] by final ratification on March 1, 1781; at which point Congress became the [[Congress of the Confederation]].  Under the Articles, the states retained sovereignty over all governmental functions not specifically relinquished to the national government.  The individual articles set the rules for current and future operations of the United States government. It was made capable of making war and peace, negotiating diplomatic and commercial agreements with foreign countries, and deciding disputes between the states, including their additional and contested western territories. Article XIII stipulated that &quot;their provisions shall be inviolably observed by every state&quot; and &quot;[[perpetual Union|the Union shall be perpetual]]&quot;. John Dickinson and Benjamin Franklin's  handwritten drafts of the Articles of Confederation are housed at the National Archives in Washington, DC.

==Operation==
The Articles were created by delegates from the states in the Second Continental Congress out of a need to have &quot;a plan of confederacy for securing the freedom, sovereignty, and independence of the United States.&quot; After the war, nationalists, especially those who had been active in the Continental Army, complained that the Articles were too weak for an effective government. There was no president, no executive agencies, no judiciary and no tax base. The absence of a tax base meant that there was no way to pay off state and national debts from the war years except by requesting money from the states, which seldom arrived.

In 1788, with the approval of Congress, the Articles were replaced by the [[United States Constitution]] and the new government began operations in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Morris| first = Richard| title = The Forging of the Union, 1782–1789| year = 1988| publisher = HarperCollins Publishers| pages = 245–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ratification==
Congress began to move for ratification of the Articles of Confederation in 1777:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Permit us, then, earnestly to recommend these articles to the immediate and dispassionate attention of the legislatures of the respective states. Let them be candidly reviewed under a sense of the difficulty of combining in one system the various sentiments and interests of a continent divided into so many sovereign and independent communities, under a conviction of the absolute necessity of uniting all our councils and all our strength, to maintain and defend our common liberties...''&lt;ref name=&quot;ratificationletter&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc00941)) |title= Monday, November 17, 1777 |journal= Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774–1789}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The document could not become officially effective until it was [[Ratification|ratified]] by all 13 states. The first state to ratify was [[Virginia]] on December 16, 1777; the thirteenth state to ratify was [[Maryland]] on February 2, 1781. A ceremonial confirmation of of this thirteenth, final ratification took place in the Congress on March 1, 1781 at high noon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://history.state.gov/milestones/1776-1783/Articles |title= Articles of Confederation, 1777–1781 |publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]] |accessdate= January 3, 2011 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101230164242/http://history.state.gov/milestones/1776-1783/Articles |archivedate= December 30, 2010 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Elliot| first = Jonathan| title = The Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution| url = http://books.google.com/?id=pTAMAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA98| accessdate = February 21, 2012| edition = 2nd| volume = 1| year = 1836| publisher = Editor on the Pennsylvania Avenue| location = Washington, D.C.| page = 98 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The ratification process dragged on for several years, stalled by the refusal of some states to rescind their claims to land in the West. [[Maryland]] was the last holdout; it refused to go along until [[Virginia]] and New York agreed to [[State cessions|cede their claims]] in the [[Ohio River]] Valley.  It took a little over three years for all states to ratify.

The Articles provided for a blanket acceptance of [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|Province of Quebec]] (referred to as &quot;Canada&quot; in the Articles) into the United States if it chose to do so. It did not, and the subsequent Constitution carried no such special provision of admission.

==Article summaries==
Even though the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution were established by many of the same people,{{dubious|date=November 2013}} the two documents are very different.  Stylistically, the Articles are more wordy, less straightforward and less quotable than the Constitution.  Functionally, they lay out very different forms of government.  The original five-page Articles contained a preamble, 13 articles, a conclusion, and a signatory section.
The preamble states that the signatory states &quot;agree to certain articles of Confederation and perpetual Union&quot; between the 13 states.
The following list contains short summaries of each of the 13 articles.
# Establishes the name of the confederation with these words: &quot;The Stile of this confederacy shall be 'The United States of America.'&quot;
# Asserts the sovereignty of each state, except for the specific powers delegated to the confederation government, i.e. &quot;Each state retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence, and every power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not by this Confederation expressly delegated.&quot;
# Not being sovereign, it does not call the United States of America a &quot;nation&quot; or &quot;government,&quot; but instead says, &quot;The said States hereby severally enter into a firm league of friendship with each other, for their common defense, the security of their liberties, and their mutual and general welfare, binding themselves to assist each other, against all force offered to, or attacks made upon them, or any of them, on account of religion, sovereignty, trade, or any other pretense whatever.&quot;
# But to instill a national feeling, &quot;[t]he better to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship and intercourse among the people of the different States in this union,&quot; it establishes [[Equality before the law|equal treatment]] and [[freedom of movement]] for the free inhabitants of each state to pass unhindered between the states, excluding &quot;[[pauper]]s, [[vagabond (person)|vagabonds]], and [[fugitive]]s from justice.&quot; All these people are entitled to equal rights established by the state into which he travels. If a crime is committed in one state and the perpetrator flees to another state, he will be [[extradition|extradited]] to and tried in the state in which the crime was committed.
# Allocates one vote in the [[Congress of the Confederation]] (the &quot;United States in Congress Assembled&quot;) to each state, which is entitled to a delegation of between two and seven members. Members of Congress are appointed by state legislatures. Also, individuals may not serve more than three out of any six years.
# Only the central government is allowed to conduct foreign political or commercial relations and to declare war. No state or official may accept foreign gifts or titles, and granting any title of nobility is forbidden to all. States are restrained from forming sub-national groups. No state may tax or interfere with treaty stipulations [[Model Treaty|already proposed]]. No state may engage in war, without permission of Congress, unless invaded or that is imminent on the frontier; no state may maintain a peace-time standing army or navy, unless infested by pirates, but every State is required to keep ready, a well-regulated (meaning well trained), disciplined, and equipped militia, with sufficient public stores of a due number of field pieces, tents, a proper quantity of arms, ammunition and camp equipage.
# Whenever an army is raised for common defense, colonels and military ranks below colonel will be named by the state legislatures.
# Expenditures by the United States of America will be paid by funds raised by state legislatures, and apportioned to the states based on the real property values of each.
# Defines the sole and exclusive right and power of the United States in Congress assembled to determine peace and war; to exchange ambassadors; to enter into treaties and alliances, with some provisos; to establish rules for deciding all cases of captures or prizes on land or water; to grant [[Letter of marque|letters of marque and reprisal]] (documents authorizing [[privateer]]s) in times of peace; to appoint courts for the trial of pirates and crimes committed on the high seas; to establish courts for appeals in all cases of captures, but no member of Congress may be appointed a judge; to set weights and measures (including coins), and for Congress to serve as a final court for disputes between states.&lt;!-- Still incomplete --&gt;
# &quot;The [[Committee of the States]], or any nine of them, shall be authorized to execute, in the recess of Congress, such of the powers of Congress as the United States in Congress assembled, by the consent of the nine States, shall from time to time think expedient to vest them with; provided that no power be delegated to the said Committee, for the exercise of which, by the Articles of Confederation, the voice of nine States in the Congress of the United States assembled be requisite.&quot;
# If &quot;Canada&quot; (as the British-held [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|Province of Quebec]] was also known) accedes to this confederation, it will be admitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/artconf.asp |title= Articles of Confederation}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Reaffirms that the Confederation accepts war debt incurred by Congress before the existence of the Articles.
# Declares that the Articles are perpetual, and can only be altered by approval of Congress with ratification by all the state legislatures.

While still at war with Britain, the Founding Fathers were divided between those seeking a powerful, centralized national government (the &quot;federalists&quot;), and those seeking a loosely structured one (the &quot;anti federalists&quot;). Jealously guarding their new independence, members of the Continental Congress arrived at a compromise solution dividing sovereignty between the states and the central government, with a [[unicameral]] legislature that protected the liberty of the individual states. While calling on Congress to regulate military and monetary affairs, for example, the Articles of Confederation provided no mechanism with which to compel the States to comply with requests for either troops or revenue. At times, this left the military without adequate funding, supplies or even food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Carp| first = E. Wayne| title = To Starve the Army at Pleasure: Continental Army Administration and American Political Culture, 1775–1783| year = 1980| publisher = UNC Press Books| isbn = 978-0-8078-4269-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The end of the Revolutionary War==
The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], which ended hostilities with Great Britain, languished in Congress for months because several state representatives failed to attend sessions of the national legislature to ratify it. Yet Congress had no power to enforce attendance. In September 1783, George Washington complained that Congress was paralyzed.&lt;ref&gt;''Congress have come to no determination ''yet'' respecting the Peace Establishment nor am I able to say when they will. I have lately had a conference with a Committee on this subject, and have reiterated my former opinions, but it appears to me that there is not a sufficient representation to discuss ''Great'' National points.''[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/mgw:@field(DOCID+@lit(gw270170)) Letter George Washington to George Clinton], September 11, 1783. [http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/gwhtml/gwhome.html The George Washington Papers, 1741–1799]&lt;/ref&gt; Many revolutionaries had gone to their respective home countries after the war, and local government and self-rule seemed quite satisfactory.

==Function==

===The Army===
The Articles supported the Congressional direction of the [[Continental Army]], and allowed the states to present a unified front when dealing with the European powers. As a tool to build a centralized war-making government, they were largely a failure: Historian Bruce Chadwick wrote:

{{quote|George Washington had been one of the very first proponents of a strong federal government. The army had nearly disbanded on several occasions during the winters of the war because of the weaknesses of the Continental Congress. ... The delegates could not draft soldiers and had to send requests for regular troops and militia to the states. Congress had the right to order the production and purchase of provisions for the soldiers, but could not force anyone to supply them, and the army nearly starved in several winters of war.&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick p. 469. Phelps pp. 165–166. Phelps wrote:
:&quot;It is hardly surprising, given their painful confrontations with a weak central government and the sovereign states, that the former generals of the Revolution as well as countless lesser officers strongly supported the creation of a more muscular union in the 1780s and fought hard for the ratification of the Constitution in 1787. Their wartime experiences had nationalized them.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Continental Congress, before the Articles were approved, had promised soldiers a pension of half pay for life. However Congress had no power to compel the states to fund this obligation, and as the war wound down after the victory at Yorktown the sense of urgency to support the military was no longer a factor. No progress was made in Congress during the winter of 1783–84. General Henry Knox, who would later become the first [[Secretary of War]] under the Constitution, blamed the weaknesses of the Articles for the inability of the government to fund the army. The army had long been supportive of a strong union.&lt;ref&gt;Puls pp. 174–176&lt;/ref&gt; Knox wrote:

{{quote|The army generally have always reprobated the idea of being thirteen armies. Their ardent desires have been to be one continental body looking up to one sovereign. ... It is a favorite toast in the army, &quot;A hoop to the barrel&quot; or &quot;Cement to the Union&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Puls p. 177&quot;&gt;Puls p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As Congress failed to act on the petitions, Knox wrote to Gouverneur Morris, four years before the Philadelphia Convention was convened, &quot;As the present Constitution is so defective, why do not you great men call the people together and tell them so; that is, to have a convention of the States to form a better Constitution.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Puls p. 177&quot; /&gt;

Once the war had been won, the [[Continental Army]] was largely disbanded. A very small national force was maintained to man the frontier forts and to protect against [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] attacks. Meanwhile, each of the states had an army (or militia), and 11 of them had Navies. The wartime promises of bounties and land grants to be paid for service were not being met. In 1783, [[George Washington]] defused the [[Newburgh conspiracy]], but riots by unpaid [[Pennsylvania]] veterans forced Congress to leave Philadelphia temporarily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Lodge| first = Henry Cabot| title = George Washington, Vol. I| url = http://www.fulltextarchive.com/page/George-Washington-Vol-I4/#p98| volume = I| year = 1893 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Congress from time to time during the Revolutionary War requisitioned troops from the states. Any contributions were voluntary, and in the debates of 1788 the Federalists (who supported the proposed new Constitution) claimed that state politicians acted unilaterally, and contributed when the Continental army protected their state's interests. The Anti-Federalists claimed that state politicians understood their duty to the Union and contributed to advance its needs. Dougherty (2009) concludes that generally the States' behavior validated the Federalist analysis. This helps explain why the Articles of Confederation needed reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= Keith L. |last= Dougherty |title= An Empirical Test of Federalist and Anti-Federalist Theories of State Contributions, 1775–1783 |journal= Social Science History |date=  Spring 2009 |volume= 33 |issue= 1 |pages= 47–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign policy===
Even after peace had been achieved in 1783, the weakness of the Confederation government frustrated the ability of the government to conduct foreign policy. In 1789, [[Thomas Jefferson]], concerned over the failure to fund an American naval force to confront the [[Barbary Coast|Barbary pirates]], wrote to [[James Monroe]], &quot;It will be said there is no money in the treasury. There never will be money in the treasury till the Confederacy shows its teeth. The states must see the rod.”&lt;ref&gt;Ellis 92&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the [[Jay–Gardoqui Treaty]] with [[Spain]] in 1789 also showed weakness in foreign policy. In this treaty — which was never ratified due to its immense unpopularity — the United States was to give up rights to use the [[Mississippi River]] for 25 years, which would have economically strangled the settlers west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. Finally, due to the Confederation's military weakness, it could not compel the [[British army]] to leave frontier forts which were on American soil — forts which, in 1783, the British promised to leave, but which they delayed leaving pending U.S. implementation of other provisions such as ending action against [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]]s and allowing them to seek compensation. This incomplete British implementation of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] was superseded by the implementation of [[Jay's Treaty]] in 1795 under the new [[U.S. Constitution]].

===Taxation and Commerce===
Under the Articles of Confederation, the central government's power was kept quite limited. The Confederation Congress could make decisions, but lacked enforcement powers. Implementation of most decisions, including modifications to the Articles, required unanimous approval of all thirteen state legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Jensen| first = Merrill| title = The New Nation: A History of the United States During the Confederation, 1781–1789| year = 1950| publisher = Northeastern University Press| isbn = 978-0-930350-14-7| pages = 177–233 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress was denied any powers of [[taxation]]: it could only request money from the states. The states often failed to meet these requests in full, leaving both Congress and the Continental Army chronically short of money. As more money was printed by Congress, the continental dollars depreciated. In 1779, George Washington wrote to [[John Jay]], who was serving as the president of the Continental Congress, &quot;that a wagon load of money will scarcely purchase a wagon load of provisions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stahr p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Jay and the Congress responded in May by requesting $45&amp;nbsp;million from the States. In an appeal to the States to comply, Jay wrote that the taxes were &quot;the price of liberty, the peace, and the safety of yourselves and posterity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stahr p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that Americans should avoid having it said &quot;that America had no sooner become independent than she became insolvent&quot; or that &quot;her infant glories and growing fame were obscured and tarnished by broken contracts and violated faith.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stahr pp. 107–108&lt;/ref&gt; The States did not respond with any of the money requested from them.

Congress had also been denied the power to regulate either foreign trade or [[interstate commerce]] and, as a result, all of the States maintained control over their own trade policies. The states and the Confederation Congress both incurred large debts during the Revolutionary War, and how to repay those debts became a major issue of debate following the War. Some States paid off their war debts and others did not. Federal assumption of the states' war debts became a major issue in the deliberations of the Constitutional Convention.

===Accomplishments of the Confederation===
Nevertheless, the Confederation Congress did take two actions with long lasting impact. The [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] and [[Northwest Ordinance]] created territorial government, set up protocols for the admission of new states, the division of land into useful units, and set aside land in each township for public use. This system represented a sharp break from imperial colonization, as in Europe, and provided the basis for the rest of American continental expansion through the 19th Century.

The [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] established both the general practices of land surveying in the west and northwest and the land ownership provisions used throughout the later westward expansion beyond the [[Mississippi River]].  Frontier lands were surveyed into the now-familiar squares of land called the [[township]] (36 square miles), the [[Section (United States land surveying)|section]] (one square mile), and the quarter section (160 [[acre]]s). This system was carried forward to most of the States west of the Mississippi (excluding areas of [[Texas]] and [[California]] that had already been surveyed and divided up by the [[Spanish Empire]]). Then, when the [[Homestead Act]] was enacted in 1867, the quarter section became the basic unit of land that was granted to new settler-farmers.

The [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787 noted the agreement of the original states to give up [[state cessions|northwestern land claims]], organized the [[Northwest Territory]] and thus cleared the way for the entry of five new states, and part of a sixth to the Union.  To be specific, [[Massachusetts]], [[Connecticut]], [[New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Virginia]] gave up all of their claims to land north of the [[Ohio River]] and west of the (present) western border of Pennsylvania.  Over several decades a number of new states were formed from this land: [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], [[Illinois]], [[Michigan]], and [[Wisconsin]], and the part of [[Minnesota]] east of the Mississippi River.  The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 also made great advances in the abolition of slavery. New states admitted to the union in said territory would never be slave states.

==The United States of America under the Articles==
The peace treaty left the United States independent and at peace but with an unsettled governmental structure. The Articles envisioned a permanent confederation, but granted to the Congress—the only federal institution—little power to finance itself or to ensure that its resolutions were enforced. There was no president and no national court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Morris| first = Richard B.| title = The Forging of the Union, 1781–1789| year = 1987| publisher = Harper &amp; Row| isbn = 978-0-06-091424-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Frankel| first = Benjamin| title = History in Dispute: The American Revolution, 1763–1789| year = 2003| publisher = St James Press| pages = 17–24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although historians generally agree that the Articles were too weak to hold the fast-growing nation together, they do give credit to the settlement of the western issue, as the states voluntarily turned over their lands to national control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = McNeese| first = Tim| title = Revolutionary America 1764–1799| year = 2009| publisher = Chelsea House Pub| isbn = 978-1-60413-350-9| page = 104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1783, with the end of the British blockade, the new nation was regaining its prosperity. However, trade opportunities were restricted by the mercantilism of the British and French empires. The ports of the British West Indies were closed to all staple products which were not carried in British ships. France and Spain established similar policies. Simultaneously, new manufacturers faced sharp competition from British products which were suddenly available again. Political unrest in several states and efforts by debtors to use popular government to erase their debts increased the anxiety of the political and economic elites which had led the Revolution. The apparent inability of the Congress to redeem the public obligations (debts) incurred during the war, or to become a forum for productive cooperation among the states to encourage commerce and economic development, only aggravated a gloomy situation. In 1786–87, [[Shays' Rebellion]], an uprising of farmers in western Massachusetts against the state court system, threatened the stability of state government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Murrin| first1 = John M.| title = Liberty, Equality, Power, A History of the American People: To 1877| year = 2008| publisher = Wadsworth Publishing Company| isbn = 978-1-111-83086-1| page = 187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Continental Congress printed paper money which was so depreciated that it ceased to pass as currency, spawning the expression &quot;not worth a continental&quot;. Congress could not levy taxes and could only make requisitions upon the States. Less than a million and a half dollars came into the treasury between 1781 and 1784, although the governors had been asked for two million in 1783 alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Jensen| first = Merrill| title = The Articles of Confederation| year = 1959| publisher = University of Wisconsin Press| isbn = 978-0-299-00204-6| page = 37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Adams went to London in 1785 as the first representative of the United States, he found it impossible to secure a treaty for unrestricted commerce. Demands were made for favors and there was no assurance that individual states would agree to a treaty. Adams stated it was necessary for the States to confer the power of passing navigation laws to Congress, or that the States themselves pass retaliatory acts against Great Britain. Congress had already requested and failed to get power over navigation laws. Meanwhile, each State acted individually against Great Britain to little effect. When other New England states closed their ports to British shipping, Connecticut hastened to profit by opening its ports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ferling| first = John| title = John Adams: A Life| year = 2010| publisher = Oxford University Press, USA| isbn = 978-0-19-975273-7| pages = 257–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1787 Congress was unable to protect manufacturing and shipping. State legislatures were unable or unwilling to resist attacks upon private contracts and public credit. Land speculators expected no rise in values when the government could not defend its borders nor protect its frontier population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Jack N. |last= Rakove |chapter= The Collapse of the Articles of Confederation |title= The American Founding: Essays on the Formation of the Constitution |editor1-first= J.

The idea of a convention to revise the Articles of Confederation grew in favor. [[Alexander Hamilton]] realized while serving as Washington's top aide that a strong central government was necessary to avoid foreign intervention and allay the frustrations due to an ineffectual Congress. Hamilton led a group of like-minded nationalists, won Washington's endorsement, and convened the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|Annapolis Convention]] in 1786 to petition Congress to call a constitutional convention to meet in Philadelphia to remedy the long-term crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Chernow| first = Ron| title = Alexander Hamilton| year = 2004| publisher = Penguin Books| isbn = 978-1-101-20085-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signatures==
The Second Continental Congress approved the Articles for distribution to the states on November 15, 1777. A copy was made for each state and one was kept by the [[Continental Congress|Congress]]. On November 28, the copies sent to the states for ratification were unsigned, and the cover letter, dated November 17, had only the signatures of [[Henry Laurens]] and [[Charles Thomson]], who were the [[President of the Continental Congress|President]] and Secretary to the Congress.

The ''Articles'', however, were unsigned, and the date was blank. Congress began the signing process by examining their copy of the ''Articles'' on June 27, 1778. They ordered a final copy prepared (the one in the National Archives), and that delegates should inform the secretary of their authority for ratification.

On July 9, 1778, the prepared copy was ready. They dated it, and began to sign. They also requested each of the remaining states to notify its delegation when ratification was completed. On that date, delegates present from [[New Hampshire]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Connecticut]], [[New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Virginia]] and [[South Carolina]] signed the Articles to indicate that their states had ratified. [[New Jersey]], [[Delaware]] and [[Maryland]] could not, since their states had not ratified. [[North Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] also didn't sign that day, since their delegations were absent.

After the first signing, some delegates signed at the next meeting they attended. For example, John Wentworth of New Hampshire added his name on August 8. John Penn was the first of North Carolina's delegates to arrive (on July 10), and the delegation signed the ''Articles'' on July 21, 1778.

The other states had to wait until they ratified the ''Articles'' and notified their Congressional delegation. Georgia signed on July 24, New Jersey on November 26, and Delaware on February 12, 1779. Maryland refused to ratify the ''Articles'' until every state had ceded its western land claims.

[[Image:Act of Maryland to ratify Articles.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The Act of the Maryland legislature to ratify the Articles of Confederation on February 2, 1781]]
On February 2, 1781, the much-awaited decision was taken by the [[Maryland General Assembly]] in [[Annapolis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lawsofmaryland&quot;&gt;{{cite web  |date= February 2, 1781 |work= Laws of Maryland, 1781 |url= http://aomol.net/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000203/html/am203--265.html |title= An ACT to empower the delegates}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the last piece of business during the afternoon Session, &quot;among engrossed Bills&quot; was &quot;signed and sealed by Governor [[Thomas Sim Lee]] in the Senate Chamber, in the presence of the members of both Houses... an Act to empower the delegates of this state in Congress to subscribe and ratify the articles of confederation&quot; and perpetual union among the states. The Senate then adjourned &quot;to the first Monday in August next.&quot; The decision of Maryland to ratify the Articles was reported to the Continental Congress on February 12. The confirmation signing of the ''Articles'' by the two Maryland delegates took place in Philadelphia at noon time on March 1, 1781 and was celebrated in the afternoon. With these events, the Articles were entered into force and the United States of America came into being as a sovereign federal state.

Congress had debated the ''Articles'' for over a year and a half, and the ratification process had taken nearly three and a half years. Many participants in the original debates were no longer delegates, and some of the signers had only recently arrived. The ''Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union'' were signed by a group of men who were never present in the Congress at the same time.

Roger Sherman (Connecticut) was the only person to sign all four great state papers of the United States: the [[Continental Association]], the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution.

Robert Morris (Pennsylvania) signed three of the great state papers of the United States: the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution.

John Dickinson (Delaware), Daniel Carroll (Maryland) and Gouverneur Morris (New York), along with Sherman and Robert Morris, were the only five people to sign both the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution (Gouverneur Morris represented Pennsylvania when signing the Constitution).

==Presidents of the Congress==
The following list is of those who led the [[Congress of the Confederation]] under the ''Articles of Confederation'' as the [[President of the United States in Congress Assembled|Presidents of the United States in Congress Assembled]]. Under the Articles, the president was the presiding officer of Congress, chaired the [[Committee of the States]] when Congress was in recess, and performed other administrative functions. He was not, however, an executive in the way the successor [[President of the United States]] is a chief executive, since all of the functions he executed were under the direct control of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Jensen| first = Merrill| title = The Articles of Confederation: An Interpretation of the Social-Constitutional History of the American Revolution, 1774–1781| year = 1959| publisher = University of Wisconsin Press| isbn = 978-0-299-00204-6| pages = 178–179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revision and replacement==
On January 21, 1786, the Virginia Legislature, following [[James Madison|James Madison's]] recommendation, invited all the states to send delegates to Annapolis, Maryland to discuss ways to reduce interstate conflict. At what came to be known as the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|Annapolis Convention]], the few state delegates in attendance endorsed a motion that called for all states to meet in [[Philadelphia]] in May 1787 to discuss ways to improve the Articles of Confederation in a &quot;Grand Convention.&quot; Although the states' representatives to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in Philadelphia were only authorized to amend the Articles, the representatives held secret, closed-door sessions and wrote a new constitution. The new Constitution gave much more power to the central government, but characterization of the result is disputed. The general goal of the authors was to get close to a [[republic]] as defined by the philosophers of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], while trying to address the many difficulties of the interstate relationships. Historian Forrest McDonald, using the ideas of James Madison from ''Federalist 39'', describes the change this way:

{{quote|The constitutional reallocation of powers created a new form of government, unprecedented under the sun. Every previous national authority either had been centralized or else had been a confederation of sovereign states. The new American system was neither one nor the other; it was a mixture of both.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald pg. 276&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In May 1786, [[Charles Pinckney (governor)|Charles Pinckney]] of [[South Carolina]] proposed that Congress revise the Articles of Confederation. Recommended changes included granting [[United States Congress|Congress]] power over foreign and domestic commerce, and providing means for Congress to collect money from state treasuries. Unanimous approval was necessary to make the alterations, however, and Congress failed to reach a consensus. The weakness of the Articles in establishing an effective unifying government was underscored by the threat of internal conflict both within and between the states, especially after [[Shays' Rebellion]] threatened to topple the state government of Massachusetts.

Historian Ralph Ketcham comments on the opinions of [[Patrick Henry]], [[George Mason]], and other [[Anti-Federalism|antifederalists]] who were not so eager to give up the local autonomy won by the revolution:

{{quote|Antifederalists feared what Patrick Henry termed the &quot;consolidated government&quot; proposed by the new Constitution. They saw in Federalist hopes for commercial growth and international prestige only the lust of ambitious men for a &quot;splendid empire&quot; that, in the time-honored way of empires, would oppress the people with taxes, conscription, and military campaigns. Uncertain that any government over so vast a domain as the United States could be controlled by the people, Antifederalists saw in the enlarged powers of the general government only the familiar threats to the rights and liberties of the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ketcham| first = Ralph| title = Roots of the Republic: American Founding Documents Interpreted| url = http://books.google.com/?id=QlDPAtJXQu0C&amp;pg=PA381| year = 1990| publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield| isbn = 978-0-945612-19-3| page = 383 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Historians have given many reasons for the perceived need to replace the articles in 1787. Jillson and Wilson (1994) point to the financial weakness as well as the norms, rules and institutional structures of the Congress, and the propensity to divide along sectional lines.

Rakove (1988) identifies several factors that explain the collapse of the Confederation. The lack of compulsory direct taxation power was objectionable to those wanting a strong centralized state or expecting to benefit from such power. It could not collect customs after the war because tariffs were vetoed by [[Rhode Island]]. Rakove concludes that their failure to implement national measures &quot;stemmed not from a heady sense of independence but rather from the enormous difficulties that all the states encountered in collecting taxes, mustering men, and gathering supplies from a war-weary populace.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rakove 1988 p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; The second group of factors Rakove identified derived from the substantive nature of the problems the Continental Congress confronted after 1783, especially the inability to create a strong foreign policy. Finally, the Confederation's lack of coercive power reduced the likelihood for profit to be made by political means, thus potential rulers were uninspired to seek power.

When the war ended in 1783, certain special interests had incentives to create a new &quot;merchant state,&quot; much like the British state people had rebelled against. In particular, holders of war scrip and land speculators wanted a central government to pay off scrip at face value and to legalize western land holdings with disputed claims. Also, manufacturers wanted a high tariff as a barrier to foreign goods, but competition among states made this impossible without a central government.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickson p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legitimacy of closing down===
Political scientist David C. Hendrickson writes that two prominent political leaders in the Confederation, [[John Jay]] of New York and [[Thomas Burke (governor)|Thomas Burke]] of North Carolina believed that &quot;the authority of the congress rested on the prior acts of the several states, to which the states gave their voluntary consent, and until those obligations were fulfilled, neither nullification of the authority of congress, exercising its due powers, nor secession from the compact itself was consistent with the terms of their original pledges.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickson p. 153–154&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Article XIII of the Confederation, any alteration had to be approved unanimously: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he Articles of this Confederation shall be inviolably observed by every State, and the Union shall be perpetual; nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them; unless such alteration be agreed to in a Congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every State.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, Article VII of the proposed Constitution stated that it would become effective after ratification by a mere nine states, without unanimity:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Ratification of the Conventions of nine States, shall be sufficient for the Establishment of this Constitution between the States so ratifying the Same.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The apparent tension between these two provisions was addressed at the time, and remains a topic of scholarly discussion.  In 1788, [[James Madison]] remarked (in ''[[Federalist No. 40]]'') that the issue had become moot: &quot;As this objection...has been in a manner waived by those who have criticised the powers of the convention, I dismiss it without further observation.&quot;  Nevertheless, it is an interesting historical and legal question whether opponents of the Constitution could have plausibly attacked the Constitution on that ground.  At the time, there were state legislators who argued that the Constitution was not an alteration of the Articles of Confederation, but rather would be a complete replacement so the unanimity rule did not apply.&lt;ref name=Maier&gt;Maier, Pauline.  ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=-DvolFMBVRgC&amp;pg=PA62 Ratification: The People Debate the Constitution, 1787-1788]'', p. 62 (Simon and Schuster, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, the Confederation had proven woefully inadequate and therefore was supposedly no longer binding.&lt;ref name=Maier /&gt;

Modern scholars such as Francisco Forrest Martin agree that the Articles of Confederation had lost its binding force because many states had violated it, and thus &quot;other states-parties did not have to comply with the Articles' unanimous consent rule&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Francisco.  ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=xNEjqp2A6ZgC&amp;pg=PA5 The Constitution as Treaty: The International Legal Constructionalist Approach to the U.S. Constitution]'', p. 5 (Cambridge University Press, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, law professor [[Akhil Amar]] suggests that there may not have really been any conflict between the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution on this point; Article VI of the Confederation specifically allowed side deals among states, and the Constitution could be viewed as a side deal until all states ratified it.&lt;ref&gt;Amar, Akhil.  ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=xfkJRm6VCQ0C&amp;pg=PA517 America's Constitution: A Biography]'', p. 517 (Random House 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final months===
According to their terms for modification (Article XIII), the Articles would still have been in effect until 1790, the year in which the last of the 13 states, [[Rhode Island]], ratified the new Constitution.&lt;!---this is not POV or SYNTH, this is apparent from a simple reading of article 13 --&gt;  The Congress under the Articles continued to convene with a quorum until October 1788, overseeing the adoption of the new Constitution by the states, setting elections and attending to other business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/continental/timeline2f.html |title= America During the Age of Revolution, 1776–1789 |publisher=Library of Congress |date= |accessdate= April 16, 2011 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110315050400/http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/continental/timeline2f.html |archivedate= March 15, 2011 |deadurl= no}}

[[File:Atlantic Ocean to Africa.ogv|thumb|300px| This video was taken by the crew of [[Expedition 29]] on board the [[International Space Station|ISS]]. The pass starts from just northeast of the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] over the North Atlantic Ocean to [[central Africa]], over [[South Sudan]].]]

The '''Atlantic Ocean''' is the world's second largest [[ocean]], behind the [[Pacific Ocean]]. With a total [[area]] of about {{convert|106,400,000|km2|sqmi}},&lt;ref name=&quot;brit&quot;&gt;&quot;The New Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, Volume 2, Encyclopædia Britannica, 1974. p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; it covers approximately 20 percent of the [[Earth's surface]] and about 29 percent of its [[water]] surface area. The first part of its name refers to [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] of [[Greek mythology]], making the Atlantic the &quot;Sea of Atlas&quot;.

The oldest known mention of &quot;Atlantic&quot; is in ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'' of [[Herodotus]] around 450 BC (Hdt. 1.202.4): ''Atlantis thalassa'' (Greek: Ἀτλαντὶς θάλασσα; English: Sea of Atlas). The term Ethiopic Ocean, derived from [[Ethiopia]], was applied to the southern Atlantic as late as the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=George Ripley|author2=Charles Anderson Dana|title=The American cyclopaedia: a popular dictionary of general knowledge|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ROQXAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA69|accessdate=15 April 2011|year=1873|publisher=Appleton|pages=69–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Europeans discovered other oceans, their term &quot;ocean&quot; was synonymous with the waters beyond the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] that are now known as the Atlantic. The early Greeks believed this ocean to be a [[Oceanus|gigantic river encircling the world]].

The Atlantic Ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending longitudinally between [[Eurasia]] and [[Africa]] to the east, and the [[Americas]] to the west. As one component of the interconnected [[World Ocean|global ocean]], it is connected in the north to the [[Arctic Ocean]], to the [[Pacific Ocean]] in the southwest, the [[Indian Ocean]] in the southeast, and the [[Southern Ocean]] in the south (other definitions describe the Atlantic as extending southward to [[Antarctica]]). The [[equator]] subdivides it into the '''North Atlantic Ocean''' and '''South Atlantic Ocean'''.

==Geography==
[[File:Porto Covo pano April 2009-4.jpg|thumb|250px|The Atlantic Ocean as seen from the western coast of [[Portugal]]|alt=Photo of surf breaking on rocky shore]]
The Atlantic Ocean is bounded on the west by North and South America. It connects to the Arctic Ocean through the [[Denmark Strait]], [[Greenland Sea]], [[Norwegian Sea]] and [[Barents Sea]]. To the east, the boundaries of the ocean proper are [[Europe]]: the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] (where it connects with the [[Mediterranean Sea]]–one of its [[marginal sea]]s–and, in turn, the [[Black Sea]], both of which also touch upon [[Asia]]) and Africa.

In the southeast, the Atlantic merges into the Indian Ocean. The [[20th meridian east|20° East meridian]], running south from [[Cape Agulhas]] to [[Antarctica]] defines its border. Some authorities show it extending south to Antarctica, while others show it bounded at the [[60th parallel south|60° parallel]] by the Southern Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iodeweb5.vliz.be/oceanteacher/index.php?module=contextview&amp;action=contextdownload&amp;id=gen11Srv32Nme37_366 ''Limits of Oceans and Seas'']. International Hydrographic Organization Special Publication No. 23, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the southwest, the [[Drake Passage]] connects it to the Pacific Ocean. The [[wikt:man-made|man-made]] [[Panama Canal]] links the Atlantic and Pacific. Besides those mentioned, other large bodies of water adjacent to the Atlantic are the [[Caribbean Sea]], the [[Gulf of Mexico]], [[Hudson Bay]], the Arctic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, the [[North Sea]], the [[Baltic Sea]], and the [[Celtic Sea]].

Covering approximately 22% of Earth's surface, the Atlantic is second in size to the Pacific. With its adjacent seas, it occupies an area of about {{convert|106400000|km2|sqmi}};&lt;ref name=&quot;brit&quot; /&gt; without them, it has an area of {{convert|82400000|km2|sqmi}}. The land that drains into the Atlantic covers four times that of either the Pacific or Indian oceans. The volume of the Atlantic with its adjacent seas is 354,700,000&amp;nbsp;cubic kilometers (85,100,000&amp;nbsp;[[cubic mile|cu mi]]) and without them 323,600,000&amp;nbsp;cubic kilometres (77,640,000&amp;nbsp;cu mi).

The average depth of the Atlantic with its adjacent seas, is {{convert|3339|m|fathom ft|lk=out}}; without them it is {{convert|3926|m|fathom ft}}.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} The greatest depth, [[Milwaukee Deep]] with {{convert|8380|m|fathom ft}}, is in the [[Puerto Rico Trench]]. The Atlantic's width varies from {{convert|1538|nmi|km mi|lk=in}} between [[Brazil]] and [[Sierra Leone]] to over {{convert|3450|nmi|km mi|-2}} in the south.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Cultural significance==
[[Transatlantic crossing|Transatlantic travel]] played a major role in the expansion of Western civilization into the Americas. It is the Atlantic that separates the &quot;[[Old World]]&quot; from the &quot;[[New World]]&quot;. In [[modern history|modern times]], some [[idiom]]s refer to the ocean in a humorously diminutive way as '''the Pond''', describing both the geographical and cultural divide between North America and Europe, in particular between the English-speaking nations of both continents. Many British people refer to the United States and Canada as &quot;across the pond&quot;, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Example: BBC Click – Episode 4 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;Black Atlantic&quot; refers to the role of this ocean in shaping black people's history, not least in diasporas. Irish migration to the US is meant when the term &quot;The Green Atlantic&quot; is used. The &quot;Red Atlantic&quot; is a relatively new term that refers to seafarers as proletarians and revolutionaries who historically resisted exploitation at sea and forged a new multicultural and polyglot Atlantic working-class. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=David|first=Armitage|title=The Red Atlantic|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/reviews_in_american_history/v029/29.4armitage.html|publisher=Project MUSE|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ocean floor==
[[File:Atlantic bathymetry.jpg|thumb|Atlantic [[bathymetry]]|Map that uses color to show ocean depth]]
The principal feature of the [[bathymetry]] (bottom [[topography]]) is a [[Mid-ocean ridge|submarine mountain range]] called the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Kenneth J. Hsü| title = The Challenger at Sea: A Ship That Revolutionized Earth Science| year = 1992| isbn = 978-0-691-08735-1| page = 57 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It extends from [[Iceland]] in the north to approximately [[58th parallel south|58° South latitude]], reaching a maximum width of about {{convert|860|nmi|km mi|-1}}. A great [[rift valley]] also extends along the ridge over most of its length. The depth of water at the apex of the ridge is less than {{convert|2700|m|fathom ft}} in most places, while the bottom of the ridge is three times as deep. Several peaks rise above the water and form islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Kenneth J. Hsü| title = The Mediterranean Was a Desert: A Voyage of the Glomar Challenger| year = 1987| isbn = 978-0-691-02406-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The South Atlantic Ocean has an additional submarine ridge, the [[Walvis Ridge]].&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic Atlas of the World: Revised Sixth Edition, National Geographic Society, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mid-Atlantic Ridge separates the Atlantic Ocean into two large [[trough (geology)|troughs]] with depths from {{convert|3700|-|5500|m|fathom ft}}. Transverse ridges running between the continents and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge divide the ocean floor into numerous basins. Some of the larger basins are the [[Blake Basin|Blake]], Guiana, North American, Cape Verde, and Canaries basins in the North Atlantic. The largest South Atlantic basins are the Angola, Cape, Argentina, and Brazil basins.

The deep ocean floor is thought to be fairly flat with occasional deeps, [[abyssal plains]], [[oceanic trench|trenches]], [[seamount]]s, [[Oceanic basin|basins]], [[Oceanic plateau|plateaus]], [[Submarine canyon|canyons]], and some [[guyot]]s. Various shelves along the margins of the continents constitute about 11% of the bottom topography with few deep channels cut across the continental rise.

Ocean floor trenches and seamounts:
* [[Puerto Rico Trench]], in the North Atlantic, is the deepest trench at {{convert|8605|m|fathom ft}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sea-seek.com/site/Milwaukee_Deep Milwaukee Deep]. sea-seek.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Laurentian Abyss]] is found off the eastern coast of [[Canada]]
* [[South Sandwich Trench]] reaches a depth of {{convert|8428|m|fathom ft}}
* [[Romanche Trench]] is located near the [[equator]] and reaches a depth of about {{convert|7454|m|fathom ft}}.

Ocean [[sediment]]s are composed of:
* [[Terrigenous]] deposits with land origins, consisting of sand, mud, and rock particles formed by [[erosion]], [[weathering]], and volcanic activity on land washed to sea. These materials are found mostly on the [[continental shelf|continental shelves]] and are thickest near large river mouths or off desert coasts.
* [[Pelagic]] deposits, which contain the remains of organisms that sink to the ocean floor, include red clays and [[Globigerina]], [[pteropod]], and siliceous oozes. Covering most of the ocean floor and ranging in thickness from {{convert|60|-|3300|m|fathom ft}} they are thickest in the convergence belts, notably at the [[Hamilton Ridge]] and in upwelling zones.
* [[Authigenic]] deposits consist of such materials as [[manganese nodule]]s. They occur where sedimentation proceeds slowly or where currents sort the deposits, such as in the [[Hewett Curve]].

==Water characteristics==
[[File:Circulacion termohalina.jpg|Path of the [[thermohaline circulation]]. Purple paths represent deep-water currents, while blue paths represent surface currents.|thumb|alt=Map displaying a looping line with arrows indicating that water flows eastward in the far Southern ocean, angling north east of Australia, turning sough after passing Alaska, then crossing the mid-Pacific to flow north of Australia, continuing west below Africa, then turning northwest until reaching eastern Canada, then angling east to southern Europe, then finally turning south just below Greenland and flowing down the Americas' eastern coast, and resuming its flow eastward to complete the circle]]
[[File:Oceanic gyres.png|thumb|Map of the five major ocean [[Ocean gyre|gyres]]|alt=Map showing 5 circles. The first is between western Australia and eastern Africa. The second is between eastern Australia and western South America. The third is between Japan and western North America. Of the two in the Atlantic, one is in hemisphere.]]
On average, the Atlantic is the saltiest major ocean; surface water [[salinity]] in the open ocean ranges from 33 to 37 parts per thousand (3.3 – 3.7%) by mass and varies with latitude and season. Evaporation, precipitation, river inflow and [[sea ice]] melting influence surface salinity values. Although the lowest salinity values are just north of the equator (because of heavy tropical rainfall), in general the lowest values are in the high latitudes and along coasts where large rivers enter. Maximum salinity values occur at about [[25th parallel north|25° north]] and [[25th parallel south|south]], in [[subtropical]] regions with low rainfall and high evaporation.

Surface water temperatures, which vary with latitude, current systems, and season and reflect the latitudinal distribution of solar energy, range from below {{convert|-2|C|F}}. Maximum temperatures occur north of the equator, and minimum values are found in the polar regions. In the middle latitudes, the area of maximum temperature variations, values may vary by {{convert|7|–|8|C|F}}.

The Atlantic Ocean consists of four major water masses. The North and South Atlantic central waters make up the surface. The sub-Antarctic intermediate water extends to depths of {{convert|1000|m|fathom ft}}. The [[North Atlantic Deep Water]] reaches depths of as much as {{convert|4000|m|fathom ft}}. The [[Antarctic Bottom Water]] occupies ocean basins at depths greater than 4,000 metres.

Within the North Atlantic, ocean currents isolate the [[Sargasso Sea]], a large elongated body of water, with above average salinity. The Sargasso Sea contains large amounts of [[seaweed]] and is also the spawning ground for both the [[European eel]] and the [[American eel]].

The [[Coriolis effect]] circulates North Atlantic water in a clockwise direction, whereas South Atlantic water circulates counter-clockwise. The south [[tide]]s in the Atlantic Ocean are semi-diurnal; that is, two high tides occur during each 24 lunar hours. In latitudes above [[40th parallel north|40° North]] some east-west oscillation occurs.

[[File:Atlantic hurricane graphic.gif|thumb|right|Waves in the [[trade wind]]s in the Atlantic Ocean—areas of converging winds that move along the same track as the prevailing wind—create instabilities in the atmosphere that may lead to the formation of hurricanes.|alt=Map of Caribbean showing seven approximately parallel westward-pointing arrows that extend from east of the Virgin Islands to Cuba. The southern arrows bend northward just east of the Dominican Republic before straightening out again.]]

Climate is influenced by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as winds. Because of the ocean's great capacity to store and release heat, maritime climates are more moderate and have less extreme seasonal variations than inland climates. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from water temperatures.

The oceans are the major source of the atmospheric moisture that is obtained through evaporation. Climatic zones vary with latitude; the warmest zones stretch across the Atlantic north of the equator. The coldest zones are in high latitudes, with the coldest regions corresponding to the areas covered by sea ice. Ocean currents influence climate by transporting warm and cold waters to other regions. The winds that are cooled or warmed when blowing over these currents influence adjacent land areas.

The [[Gulf Stream]] and its northern extension towards Europe, the [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]], for example, warms the atmosphere of the British Isles and north-western Europe and influences weather and climate as far south as the northern Mediterranean. The cold water currents contribute to heavy fog off the coast of eastern Canada (the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]] area) and Africa's north-western coast. In general, winds transport moisture and air over land areas. [[Tropical cyclone|Hurricanes]] develop in the southern part of the North Atlantic Ocean. More local particular weather examples could be found in examples such as the; [[Azores High]], [[Benguela Current]], [[Nor'easter]].

==History==
{{main category|History of the Atlantic Ocean}}
[[File:Pangea animation 03.gif|thumb|Animation showing the separation of [[Pangaea]], which formed the Atlantic Ocean known today|alt=Animation showing the continents separating from a single mass, making creating the Atlantic in the process]]
The Atlantic Ocean appears to be the second youngest of the five oceans. It did not exist prior to 130 million years ago, when the continents that formed from the breakup of the ancestral super continent [[Pangaea]] were drifting apart.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The Atlantic has been extensively explored since the earliest settlements along its shores.

The [[Viking]]s, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], and the Spaniards were the most famous among early explorers. After Columbus, European exploration rapidly accelerated, and many new trade routes were established.

As a result, the Atlantic became and remains the major artery between Europe and the [[Americas]] (known as transatlantic trade). Scientific explorations include the [[Challenger expedition]], the [[German Meteor expedition]], [[Columbia University]]'s [[Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory]] and the [[United States Navy Hydrographic Office]].

===Notable crossings===

* Around 980 – 982, [[Erik the Red]] discovered [[Greenland]], geographically and geologically a part of the Americas.
* In the year 1000, the Icelander [[Leif Ericson]] was the first European to set foot on North American soil, corresponding to today's Eastern coast of Canada, i. e. the province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], including the area of land named &quot;[[Vinland]]&quot; by Ericson. The [[Norsemen|Norse]] discovery was documented in the 13th century [[Icelandic Sagas]] and was corroborated by recent [[L'Anse aux Meadows|L'Anse aux Meadows archeological evidence]].
* Around 1010, [[Thorfinn Karlsefni|Thorfinnr Karlsefni]] led an attempted [[Viking]] settlement in North America with 160 settlers, but was later driven off by the natives. His son [[Snorri Thorfinnsson]] was the first American born (somewhere between 1010 and 1013) to European (Icelandic) immigrant parents.
* In 1419 and 1427, [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese navigators]] reached [[Madeira]] and [[Azores]], respectively.

==Ethiopic Ocean==
The '''[[Aethiopian Sea]]''', '''Ethiopic Ocean''' or '''Ethiopian Ocean''' (Okeanos Aithiopos), is an old name for what is now called the South Atlantic Ocean, which is separated from the North Atlantic Ocean by a narrow region between [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal, Brazil]] and [[Monrovia, Liberia]]. The use of this term illustrates a past trend towards referring to the whole continent of [[Africa]] by the name ''[[Name of Ethiopia|Aethiopia]]''. The modern nation of Ethiopia, in northeast Africa, is nowhere near the Ethiopic Ocean, which would be said to lie off the west coast of Africa. The term Ethiopian Ocean sometimes appeared until the mid-19th century, as e.g. on the map ''The Dutch colony of the Cape of Good Hope by L.S. de la Rochette, MDCCXCV&quot;, published by W. Faden in London in 1795.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==Economy==
The Atlantic has contributed significantly to the development and economy of surrounding countries. Besides major transatlantic transportation and communication routes, the Atlantic offers abundant [[petroleum]] deposits in the [[sedimentary rock]]s of the continental shelves. The Atlantic hosts the world's richest [[fishing]] resources, especially in the waters covering the shelves. The major fish are [[cod]], [[haddock]], [[hake]], [[herring]], and [[mackerel]].

The most productive areas include [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]'s [[Grand Banks]], the [[Nova Scotia]] shelf, [[Georges Bank]] off [[Cape Cod]], the [[Bahama Banks]], the waters around Iceland, the [[Irish Sea]], the [[Dogger Bank]] of the North Sea, and the Falkland Banks. [[Eel]], [[lobster]], and [[whale]]s appear in great quantities. Various international treaties attempt to reduce pollution caused by environmental threats such as oil spills, [[marine debris]], and the [[incineration]] of toxic wastes at sea. &lt;!-- This would be good if it were in an infobox

'''Climate:'''
Tropical cyclones ([[hurricane]]s) develop anywhere from off the coast of Africa near [[Cape Verde]] to the [[Windward Islands]] and move westward into the Caribbean Sea or up the east coast of [[North America]]; hurricanes can occur from May to December but are most frequent from late July to early November. Storms are common in the North Atlantic during northern winters, making ocean crossings more difficult and dangerous.
--&gt;

==Terrain==
From October to June the surface is usually covered with sea ice in the [[Labrador Sea]], [[Denmark Strait]], and Baltic Sea. A clockwise warm-water [[gyre]] occupies the northern Atlantic, and a counter-clockwise warm-water gyre appears in the southern Atlantic. The [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]], a rugged north-south centerline for the entire Atlantic basin, first discovered by the [[Challenger Expedition]] dominates the ocean floor. This was formed by the vulcanism that also formed the ocean floor and the islands rising from it.

The Atlantic has irregular coasts indented by numerous bays, gulfs, and seas. These include the [[Norwegian Sea]], [[Baltic Sea]], [[North Sea]], [[Labrador Sea]], [[Black Sea]], [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], [[Bay of Fundy]], [[Gulf of Maine]], [[Mediterranean Sea]], [[Gulf of Mexico]], and [[Caribbean Sea]].

[[List of islands in the Atlantic Ocean|Islands]] include [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] (including hundreds of surrounding islands), [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]], [[Faroe Islands]], [[Great Britain]] (including numerous surrounding islands), [[Ireland]], [[Rockall]], [[Sable Island]], [[Azores]], [[St. Pierre and Miquelon]], [[Madeira]], [[Bermuda]], [[Canary Islands]], [[Caribbean]], [[Cape Verde]], [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], [[Annobón Province]], [[Fernando de Noronha]], [[Rocas Atoll]], [[Ascension Island]], [[Saint Helena]], [[Trindade and Martim Vaz]], [[Tristan da Cunha]], [[Gough Island]] (Also known as Diego Alvarez), [[Falkland Islands]], [[Tierra del Fuego]], [[South Georgia Island]], [[South Sandwich Islands]], and [[Bouvet Island]].

===Natural resources===
The Atlantic harbors [[petroleum]] and [[gas]] fields, [[fish]], [[marine mammal]]s ([[Pinniped|seals]] and whales), [[sand]] and [[gravel]] aggregates, [[placer deposit]]s, [[polymetallic nodules]], and precious stones.

===Natural hazards===
[[File:Iceberg A22A, South Atlantic Ocean.jpg|thumb|Iceberg A22A in the South Atlantic Ocean|alt=Overhead photo of iceberg with surrounding clouds|alt=Overhead photo of iceberg]]
[[Iceberg]]s are common from February to August in the [[Davis Strait]], [[Denmark Strait]], and the northwestern Atlantic and have been spotted as far south as [[Bermuda]] and [[Madeira]]. Ships are subject to [[Superstructure (ship)|superstructure]] [[icing (nautical)|icing]] in the extreme north from October to May. Persistent fog can be a maritime hazard from May to September, as can hurricanes north of the equator (May to December).

The United States' southeast coast has a long history of shipwrecks due to its many shoals and reefs. The Virginia and North Carolina coasts were particularly dangerous.

The [[Bermuda Triangle]] is popularly believed to be the site of numerous aviation and shipping incidents because of unexplained and supposedly mysterious causes, but [[Coast Guard]] records do not support this belief.

[[Hurricanes]] are also a natural hazard in the Atlantic, but mainly in the northern part of the ocean, rarely [[tropical cyclones]] form in the southern parts. Hurricanes usually form between 1 June and 30 November of every year.

==Current environmental issues==
Endangered marine species include the [[manatee]], [[Pinniped|seals]], [[sea lion]]s, [[turtle]]s, and [[whale]]s. [[Drift net]] fishing can kill [[dolphin]]s, [[albatross]]es and other seabirds ([[petrel]]s, [[auk]]s), hastening the fish stock decline and contributing to international disputes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animallaw.info/articles/arus12bcenvtlafflrev473.htm Problems and Prospects for the Pelagic Driftnet]. animallaw.info. Retrieved on 27 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Municipal pollution comes from the eastern [[United States]], southern [[Brazil]], and eastern [[Argentina]]; [[oil pollution]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]], [[Gulf of Mexico]], [[Lake Maracaibo]], [[Mediterranean Sea]], and [[North Sea]]; and industrial waste and municipal sewage pollution in the Baltic Sea, North Sea, and Mediterranean Sea.

In 2005, there was some concern that warm northern European currents were slowing down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5033329 Atlantic Ocean's 'Heat Engine' Chills Down] by Christopher Joyce. All Things Considered, National Public Radio, 30 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 June 2006, Florida's wildlife commission voted to take the manatee off the state's endangered species list. Some environmentalists worry that this could erode safeguards for the popular sea creature.

===Marine pollution===
{{Main|Marine pollution}}
{{See also|Ship pollution}}
Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture [[fertilizer]] chemicals as well as [[livestock]] and [[human]] waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]] and the creation of a [[dead zone (ecology)|dead zone]].&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian A. Gerlach &quot;Marine Pollution&quot;, Springer, Berlin (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marine debris]], which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of [[Oceanic gyres|gyres]] and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.

'''Arthur Schopenhauer''' (22 February 1788&amp;nbsp;– 21 September 1860) was a German philosopher best known for his book, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' (German: ''Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung''), in which he claimed that our world is driven by a continually dissatisfied [[will (philosophy)|will]], continually seeking satisfaction. Influenced by [[Eastern philosophy]], he maintained that the &quot;truth was recognized by the [[Indian philosophy|sages of India]]&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Representation, Vol. 1, trans. E. Payne, (New York: Dover Publishing Inc., 1969), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; consequently, his solutions to suffering were similar to those of [[Vedantic]] and [[Buddhist]] thinkers (i.e., [[asceticism]]).

At age 25, he published his doctoral dissertation, ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]'', which examined the four distinct aspects&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Representation, Vol. 1, trans. E.

He has influenced many thinkers, including [[Friedrich Nietzsche]],&lt;ref name=SchopBR&gt;Addressed in: Cate, Curtis. Friedrich Nietzsche.

This awareness of the lack of free will keeps me from taking myself and my fellow men too seriously as acting and deciding individuals, and from losing my temper.&quot; Schopenhauer's clearer, actual words were: &quot;You can do what you will, but in any given moment of your life you can ''will'' only one definite thing and absolutely nothing other than that one thing.&quot; [Du kannst ''tun'' was du ''willst'': aber du kannst in jedem gegebenen Augenblick deines Lebens nur ''ein'' Bestimmtes ''wollen'' und schlechterdings nichts anderes als dieses eine.] ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Ch.

== Life ==
[[File:Gdansk Schopenhauer House.jpg|thumb|upright|Schopenhauer's birthplace house in [[Gdańsk]] ([[German language|German]]: ''Danzig''), ul. Św. Ducha (formerly Heiligegeistgasse)]]
Arthur Schopenhauer was born on 22 February 1788 in the city of Danzig ([[Gdańsk]]), on Heiligegeistgasse (known in the present day as Św. Ducha 47), the son of [[Johanna Schopenhauer]] (née Trosiener) and Heinrich Floris Schopenhauer,&lt;ref name=&quot;Google Books&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fW5Dl-tUS_oC&amp;pg=PR30&amp;dq=Schopenhauer+%2222+February%22|title=Chronology|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|coauthors=Günter Zöller, Eric F.

At the time Danzig became part of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] in 1793, Heinrich removed to Hamburg, although his firm continued trading in Danzig. In 1805, Schopenhauer's father may have committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Safranski (1990) page 12. &quot;There was in the father's life some dark and vague source of fear which later made him hurl himself to his death from the attic of his house in Hamburg.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Schopenhauer's mother Johanna moved to [[Weimar]], then the centre of [[German literature]], to pursue her writing career. After one year, Schopenhauer left the family business in Hamburg to join her. As early as 1799, he started playing the flute.&lt;ref name=Flute&gt;{{cite book|last=Cartwright|first=David E.|title=Schopenhauer: a Biography|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=End of 2nd paragraph|isbn=978-0-521-82598-6|pages=30|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=meD1bGAjO6wC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=schopenhauer+flute&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1kYMSXfz3F&amp;sig=5Wckqgmpf2AlYx0lSBoPQrOMPPI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5WnrUPbWI-WM0wXg14DIBQ&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became a student at the [[Georg August University of Göttingen|University of Göttingen]] in 1809. There he studied [[metaphysics]] and [[psychology]] under [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze]], the author of ''[[Aenesidemus (book)|Aenesidemus]]'', who advised him to concentrate on [[Plato]] and [[Immanuel Kant]]. In Berlin, from 1811 to 1812, he had attended lectures by the prominent post-Kantian philosopher [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and the theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]].
[[File:ArthurSchopenhauer.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Schopenhauer as a youth]]

In 1814, Schopenhauer began his seminal work ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' (''Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung''). He finished it in 1818 and published it the following year. In [[Dresden]] in 1819, Schopenhauer fathered, with a servant, an illegitimate daughter who was born and died the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reocities.com/c_ansata/timeline.html |title=A Schopenhauer Timeline |publisher=Reocities.com |accessdate=12 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/arthursc.htm |title=Arthur Schopenhauer |publisher=Kirjasto.sci.fi |accessdate=12 March 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100406013255/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/arthursc.htm| archivedate= 6 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1820, Schopenhauer became a lecturer at the [[University of Berlin]]. He scheduled his lectures to coincide with those of the famous philosopher [[G. W. F. Hegel]], whom Schopenhauer described as a &quot;clumsy charlatan.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur. Author's preface to &quot;On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of sufficient reason. Page 1. [[:s:On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, only five students turned up to Schopenhauer's lectures, and he dropped out of [[academia]]. A late essay, ''On University Philosophy,'' expressed his resentment towards the work conducted in academies.

While in Berlin, Schopenhauer was named as a defendant in a lawsuit initiated by a woman named Caroline Marquet.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Addressed in: Russell, Bertrand (1945).&lt;/ref&gt;
She asked for damages, alleging that Schopenhauer had pushed her. According to Schopenhauer's court testimony, she deliberately annoyed him by raising her voice while standing right outside his door.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rudiger Safranski, Rüdiger Safranski, Ewald Osers |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DEOTiprvvHIC&amp;pg=PA272&amp;lpg=PA272&amp;dq=schopenhauer+marquet#v=onepage&amp;q=schopenhauer%20marquet&amp;f=false |title=Schopenhauer and the Wild Years of Philosophy |pages=271–2 |isbn=978-0-674-79276-0 |date=1 September 1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marquet alleged that the philosopher had assaulted and battered her after she refused to leave his doorway. Her companion testified that she saw Marquet prostrate outside his apartment. Because Marquet won the lawsuit, Schopenhauer made payments to her for the next twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;Safranski (1990), Chapter 19&lt;/ref&gt; When she died, he wrote on a copy of her death certificate, ''Obit anus, abit onus'' (&quot;The old woman dies, the burden is lifted&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Magee | first = Bryan | title = The Philosophy of Schopenhauer | publisher = Clarendon Press | location = Oxford | year = 1997 | isbn = 978-0-19-823723-5 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1819 the fortunes of his mother and sister, and himself, were threatened by the failure of the firm in Danzig in which his father had been a director and shareholder. His sister accepted a compromise compensation package of 70 per cent, but Schopenhauer angrily refused this, and eventually recovered 9400 thalers.

In 1821, he fell in love with nineteen-year old opera singer, Caroline Richter (called Medon), and had a relationship with her for several years. He discarded marriage plans, however, writing, &quot;Marrying means to halve one's rights and double one's duties,&quot; and &quot;Marrying means to grasp blindfolded into a sack hoping to find an eel amongst an assembly of snakes.&quot; When he was forty-three years old, seventeen-year old Flora Weiss recorded rejecting him in her diary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hiw.kuleuven.be/eng/alumni/newslet11.pdf |title=The Leuven Philosophy Newsletter |pages=42–43 |publisher=Katholieke Universiteit Leuven}} &quot;But an examination of his life reveals a yearning for marriage frustrated by a train of rejections.&quot; In the year 1831, Schopenhauer fell in love with a girl named Flora Weiss. At a boat party in Germany he made his advance by offering her a bunch of grapes. Flora’s diary records this event as follows: &quot;I didn’t want the grapes because old Schopenhauer had touched them, so I let them slide, quite gently into the water.&quot; Apparently, she was underwhelmed.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer had a notably strained relationship with his mother Johanna Schopenhauer. After his father's death, Arthur Schopenhauer endured two long years of drudgery as a merchant, in honor of his dead father. Then his mother retired to Weimar, and Arthur Schopenhauer dedicated himself wholly to studies in the gymnasium of [[Gotha]]. He left it in disgust after seeing one of the masters lampooned, and went to live with his mother. But by that time she had already opened her famous salon, and Arthur was not compatible with the vain, ceremonious ways of the salon. He was also disgusted by the ease with which Johanna Schopenhauer had forgotten his father's memory. Consequently, he attempted university life. There, he wrote his first book, ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]''. His mother informed him that the book was incomprehensible and it was unlikely that anyone would ever buy a copy. In a fit of temper Arthur Schopenhauer told her that his work would be read long after the &quot;rubbish&quot; she wrote would have been totally forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/paschons/language_http/essays/Schopenhauer.html |title=Schopenhauer: |publisher=Courseweb.stthomas.edu |accessdate=12 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/selectedessaysof033377mbp/selectedessaysof033377mbp_djvu.txt |title=Full text of &quot;Selected Essays Of Schopenhauer&quot; |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=12 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1831, a [[cholera]] epidemic broke out in Berlin and Schopenhauer left the city. Schopenhauer settled permanently in [[Frankfurt]] in 1833, where he remained for the next twenty-seven years, living alone except for a succession of pet poodles named [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] and Butz. The numerous notes that he made during these years, amongst others on aging, were published [[Posthumous publication|posthumously]] under the title ''Senilia''.

[[File:Schopenhauer-ffm001.jpg|thumb|Grave at Frankfurt ''Hauptfriedhof'']]
Schopenhauer had a robust constitution, but in 1860 his health began to deteriorate. He died of heart failure on 21 September 1860 while sitting at home on his couch with his cat. He was 72.&lt;ref&gt;''Schopenhauer: his life and philosophy''.H Zimmern – 1932 – G. Allen &amp; Unwin ltd&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thought ==

=== Philosophy of the &quot;Will&quot; ===
{{main|The World as Will and Representation}}
[[Image:Arthur Schopenhauer Portrait by Ludwig Sigismund Ruhl 1815.jpeg|thumb|Schopenhauer in 1815, second of the critical five years of the initial composition of ''Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung''.]]
A key focus of Schopenhauer was his investigation of individual motivation. Before Schopenhauer, Hegel had popularized the concept of ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', the idea that society consisted of a [[collective consciousness]] which moved in a distinct direction, dictating the actions of its members. Schopenhauer, a reader of both Kant and Hegel, criticized their logical optimism and the belief that individual morality could be determined by society and reason. Schopenhauer believed that humans were motivated by only their own basic desires, or {{lang|de|''Wille zum Leben''}} (&quot;Will to Live&quot;), which directed all of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The reality is what Schopenhauer calls the Will, the Will to Live.&quot; Letter to Richard C. Lyon, 1 August 1949, [[George Santayana]], ''The Letters of George Santayana'', Scribner's, New York, 1955&lt;/ref&gt;

For Schopenhauer, human desire was futile, illogical, directionless, and, by extension, so was all human action in the world. He wrote &quot;Man can indeed do what he wants, but he cannot will what he wants&quot;. In this sense, he adhered to the Fichtean principle of idealism: &quot;the world is ''for'' a subject&quot;. This idealism so presented, immediately commits it to an ethical attitude, unlike the purely epistemological concerns of [[Descartes]] and [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]]. To Schopenhauer, the Will is a malignant,&lt;ref name=&quot;inveigles&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Encyclopedic English Dictionary|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|location='Schopenhauer'|isbn=978-0-19-861248-3|pages=1298}}&lt;/ref&gt; metaphysical existence which controls not only the actions of individual, intelligent agents, but ultimately all observable phenomena; an evil to be terminated via mankind's duties: [[asceticism]] and chastity.&lt;ref name=&quot;inveigles&quot;/&gt; He is credited with one of the most famous opening lines of philosophy: &quot;The world is my representation&quot;. Will, for Schopenhauer, is what Kant called the &quot;[[Noumenon|thing-in-itself]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;But like Fichte, he rejects the Kantian claim that the thing-in-itself as an unknowable substratum of experience. Schopenhauer's argument is that the thing in-itself in Kant is an incoherent sense of object: it is the opposite to objects, and yet it is said to be an object-in-itself: &quot;the phantom of a dream&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nietzsche]] was greatly influenced by this idea of Will, while developing it in a different direction.

=== Art and aesthetics ===
{{Main|Arthur Schopenhauer's aesthetics}}
For Schopenhauer, human desiring, &quot;willing,&quot; and craving cause [[suffering|suffering or pain]]. A temporary way to escape this pain is through aesthetic contemplation (a method comparable to [[Zapffe]]'s &quot;''Sublimation''&quot;). Aesthetic contemplation allows one to escape this pain—albeit temporarily—because it stops one perceiving the world as mere presentation. Instead, one no longer perceives the world as an object of perception (therefore as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds; time, space and causality) from which one is separated; rather one becomes one with that perception: &quot;''one can thus no longer separate the perceiver from the perception''&quot; (''The World as Will and Representation'', section 34). From this immersion with the world one no longer views oneself as an individual who suffers in the world due to one's individual will but, rather, becomes a &quot;''subject of cognition''&quot; to a perception that is &quot;''Pure, will-less, timeless''&quot; (section 34) where the essence, &quot;ideas,&quot; of the world are shown. Art is the practical consequence of this brief aesthetic contemplation as it attempts to depict one's immersion with the world, thus tries to depict the essence/pure ideas of the world. Music, for Schopenhauer, was the purest form of art because it was the one that depicted the will itself without it appearing as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds, therefore as an individual object. According to Daniel Albright, &quot;Schopenhauer thought that [[philosophy of music|music]] was the only art that did not merely copy ideas, but actually embodied the will itself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Albright, Modernism and Music, 2004, page 39, footnote 34&lt;/ref&gt;

He deemed music to be a timeless, universal, language which is comprehended everywhere, and can imbue global enthusiasm, if in possession of a significant melody.&lt;ref name=Music &gt;{{cite book|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|title=Essays and Aphorisms|year=1970|publisher=Penguin Classics|location='10'|isbn=0-14-044227-8|pages=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethics ===
Schopenhauer's moral theory proposed that only [[compassion]] can drive moral acts. According to Schopenhauer, compassion alone is the good of the object of the acts, that is, they cannot be inspired by either the prospect of personal utility or the feeling of duty. Mankind can also be guided by [[Ethical egoism|egoism]] and [[wikt:malice|malice]]. Egotistic acts are those guided by self-interest, desire for pleasure or happiness. Schopenhauer believed most of our deeds belong to this class. Acts of malice are different from egotistic acts. As in the case of acts of compassion, these do not target personal utility. Their aim is to cause damage to others, independently of personal gains.

==== Punishment ====
[[Image:Schopenhauer 1852.jpg|thumb|Schopenhauer in 1852]]
According to Schopenhauer, whenever we make a choice, &quot;we assume as necessary that decision was preceded by something from which it ensued, and which we call the ground or reason, or more accurately the motive, of the resultant action.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schopenhauer1974&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Schopenhauer|title=On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fvlz6t_gUFkC&amp;pg=PA212|accessdate=5 March 2013|year=1974|publisher=Open Court Publishing|isbn=978-0-87548-201-9|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Choices are not made freely. Our actions are necessary and determined because &quot;every human being, even every animal, after the motive has appeared, must carry out the action which alone is in accordance with his inborn and immutable character.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]'', § 49.&lt;/ref&gt; A definite action inevitably results when a particular motive influences a person's given, unchangeable character.
The State, Schopenhauer claimed, punishes criminals in order to prevent future crimes. It does so by placing &quot;beside every possible motive for committing a wrong a more powerful motive for leaving it undone, in the inescapable punishment. Accordingly, the criminal code is as complete a register as possible of counter-motives to all criminal actions that can possibly be imagined....&quot;&lt;ref name=twwr62&gt;Schopenhauer, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. I, § 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bquote|...the law and its fulfillment, namely punishment, are directed essentially to the ''future'', not to the ''past''. This distinguishes ''punishment'' from ''revenge'', for revenge is motivated by what has happened, and hence by the past as such. All retaliation for wrong by inflicting a pain without any object for the future is revenge, and can have no other purpose than consolation for the suffering one has endured by the sight of the suffering one has caused in another. Such a thing is wickedness and cruelty, and cannot be ethically justified. ...the object of punishment...is deterrence from crime.... Object and purpose for the future distinguish punishment from revenge, and punishment has this object only when it is inflicted ''in fulfillment of a law''. Only in this way does it proclaim itself to be inevitable and infallible for every future case; and thus it obtains for the law the power to deter....&lt;ref name=twwr62/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Rée]], in his ''The Origin of Moral Sensation'', reflected Schopenhauer's concerns when he wrote: &quot;The feeling of justice thus arises out of two errors, namely, because the punishments inflicted by authorities and educators appear as acts of retribution, and because people believe in the freedom of the will.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Should capital punishment be legal? &quot;For safeguarding the lives of citizens,&quot; he asserted, &quot;capital punishment is therefore absolutely necessary.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. II, Ch. XLVII.&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;The murderer,&quot; wrote Schopenhauer, &quot;who is condemned to death according to the law must, it is true, be now used as a mere ''means'', and with complete right. For public security, which is the principal object of the State, is disturbed by him; indeed it is abolished if the law remains unfulfilled. The murderer, his life, his person, must be the ''means'' of fulfilling the law, and thus of re-establishing public security.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. I, § 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer disagreed with those who would abolish capital punishment. &quot;Those who would like to abolish it should be given the answer: 'First remove murder from the world, and then capital punishment ought to follow.' &quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

People, according to Schopenhauer, cannot be improved. They can only be influenced by strong motives that overpower criminal motives.  Schopenhauer declared that &quot;real moral reform is not at all possible, but only determent from the deed....&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

He claimed that this doctrine was not original with him. Previously, it appeared in the writings of [[Plato]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;...he who attempts to punish in accordance with reason does not retaliate on account of the past wrong (for he could not undo something which has been done) but for the sake of the future, so that neither the wrongdoer himself, nor others who see him being punished, will do wrong again.&quot; Plato, &quot;[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]&quot;, 324 B. Plato wrote that punishment should &quot;be an example to other men not to offend.&quot; Plato, &quot;[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]&quot;, Book IX, 863.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf|Pufendorf]], and [[Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach|Anselm Feuerbach]]. Schopenhauer declared that their teaching was corrupted by subsequent errors and therefore was in need of clarification.&lt;ref name=&quot;twwr62&quot;/&gt;

=== Psychology ===
Philosophers have not traditionally been impressed by the tribulations of sex, but Schopenhauer addressed it and related concepts forthrightly:

:...one ought rather to be surprised that a thing [sex] which plays throughout so important a part in human life has hitherto practically been disregarded by philosophers altogether, and lies before us as raw and untreated material.&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur. Supplements to the Fourth Book of &quot;The World as Will and Representation, Page 338 [[:s:The World as Will and Representation/Supplements to the Fourth Book|The World as Will and Representation/Supplements to the Fourth Book]]&lt;/ref&gt;

He gave a name to a force within man which he felt had invariably precedence over reason: the Will to Live or Will to Life (''Wille zum Leben''), defined as an inherent drive within human beings, and indeed all creatures, to stay alive; a force which inveigles&lt;ref name=&quot;inveigles&quot;/&gt; us into reproducing.

Schopenhauer refused to conceive of love as either trifling or accidental, but rather understood it to be an immensely powerful force lying unseen within man's [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] and dramatically shaping the world:

:The ultimate aim of all love affairs ... is more important than all other aims in man's life; and therefore it is quite worthy of the profound seriousness with which everyone pursues it.

:What is decided by it is nothing less than the composition of the next generation ...&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur. Supplements to the Fourth Book of &quot;The World as Will and Representation. Page 340 [[:s:The World as Will and Representation/Supplements to the Fourth Book|The World as Will and Representation/Supplements to the Fourth Book]]&lt;/ref&gt;

These ideas foreshadowed the [[theory of evolution|discovery of evolution]], [[Sigmund Freud|Freud's]] concepts of the [[libido]] and the [[unconscious mind]], and [[evolutionary psychology]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Nearly a century before Freud... in Schopenhauer there is, for the first time, an explicit philosophy of the unconscious and of the body.&quot; Safranski pg. 345.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political and social thought ===

==== Politics ====
[[File:FFM Wallanlagen Schopenhauer-Denkmal.jpg|thumb|Bust in [[Frankfurt am Main]]]]
Schopenhauer's politics were, for the most part, an echo of his system of ethics (the latter being expressed in ''Die beiden Grundprobleme der Ethik'', available in English as two separate books, ''[[On the Basis of Morality]]'' and ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]''). Ethics also occupies about one quarter of his central work, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]''.

In occasional political comments in his ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'' and ''Manuscript Remains'', Schopenhauer described himself as a proponent of [[limited government]]. What was essential, he thought, was that the state should &quot;leave each man free to work out his own [[salvation]]&quot;, and so long as government was thus limited, he would &quot;prefer to be ruled by a lion than one of [his] fellow rats&quot; — i.e., by a [[monarch]], rather than a [[Republic|democrat]]. Schopenhauer shared the view of [[Thomas Hobbes]] on the necessity of the state, and of state action, to check the destructive tendencies innate to our species. He also defended the independence of the legislative, judicial and executive branches of power, and a monarch as an impartial element able to practice justice (in a practical and everyday sense, not a cosmological one).&lt;ref&gt;''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 47&lt;/ref&gt; He declared monarchy as &quot;that which is natural to man&quot; for &quot;intelligence has always under a monarchical government a much better chance against its irreconcilable and ever-present foe, stupidity&quot; and disparaged republicanism as &quot;unnatural as it is unfavourable to the higher intellectual life and the arts and sciences.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Government (Schopenhauer)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer, by his own admission, did not give much thought to politics, and several times he writes proudly of how little attention he had paid &quot;to political affairs of [his] day&quot;. In a life that spanned several revolutions in French and German government, and a few continent-shaking wars, he did indeed maintain his aloof position of &quot;minding not the times but the eternities&quot;. He wrote many disparaging remarks about Germany and the Germans. A typical example is, &quot;For a German it is even good to have somewhat lengthy words in his mouth, for he thinks slowly, and they give him time to reflect.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer attributed civilizational primacy to the northern &quot;white races&quot; due to their sensitivity and creativity (except for the ancient Egyptians and Hindus whom he saw as equal):

&lt;blockquote&gt;The highest civilization and culture, apart from the ancient Hindus and Egyptians, are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the Brahmans, the Incas, and the rulers of the South Sea Islands. All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate. This they had to do in order to make up for the parsimony of nature and out of it all came their high civilization.&lt;ref&gt;''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume II, Section 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite this, he was adamantly against differing treatment of races, was fervently anti-slavery, and supported the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement in the United States. He describes the treatment of &quot;[our] innocent black brothers whom force and injustice have delivered into [the slave-master's] devilish clutches&quot; as &quot;belonging to the blackest pages of mankind's criminal record&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Parerga and Paralipomena'', &quot;On Ethics,&quot; Sec. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer additionally maintained a marked metaphysical and political [[anti-Judaism]]. Schopenhauer argued that Christianity constituted a revolt against the materialistic basis of Judaism, exhibiting an Indian-influenced ethics reflecting the [[Aryan]]-[[Vedas|Vedic]] theme of spiritual &quot;self-conquest.&quot; This he saw as opposed to what he held to be the ignorant drive toward earthly utopianism and superficiality of a worldly Jewish spirit:

&lt;blockquote&gt;While all other religions endeavor to explain to the people by symbols the metaphysical significance of life, the religion of the Jews is entirely immanent and furnishes nothing but a mere war-cry in the struggle with other nations.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Fragments for the history of philosophy&quot;, ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume I.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Views on women ====
In Schopenhauer's 1851 essay ''[[s:Of Women|Of Women]]'', he expressed his opposition to what he called &quot;Teutonico-Christian stupidity&quot; on female affairs. Schopenhauer wrote that &quot;Women are directly fitted for acting as the nurses and teachers of our early childhood by the fact that they are themselves childish, frivolous and short-sighted&quot;. He opined that women are deficient in artistic faculties and sense of justice, and expressed opposition to [[monogamy]]. He claimed that &quot;woman is by nature meant to obey&quot;. The essay does give some compliments, however: that &quot;women are decidedly more sober in their judgment than [men] are&quot; and are more sympathetic to the suffering of others.

Schopenhauer's controversial writings have influenced many, from [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] to nineteenth-century [[feminists]].&lt;ref&gt;''Feminism and the Limits of Equality''
PA Cain – Ga. L. Rev., 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer's [[biology|biological]] analysis of the difference between the sexes, and their separate roles in the struggle for survival and reproduction, anticipates some of the claims that were later ventured by [[sociobiology|sociobiologists]] and [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Young2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Julian Young|title=Schopenhauer|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gfDyeGY0RFMC&amp;pg=PA242|accessdate=23 December 2011|date=23 June 2005|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-33346-7|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the elderly Schopenhauer sat for a sculpture portrait by [[Elisabet Ney]], he told Richard Wagner's friend [[Malwida von Meysenbug]], &quot;I have not yet spoken my last word about women. I believe that if a woman succeeds in withdrawing from the mass, or rather raising herself above the mass, she grows ceaselessly and more than a man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Safranski (1990), Chapter 24. Page 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Heredity and eugenics ====
[[File:Frankfurt Am Main-Portraits-Arthur Schopenhauer-1845.jpg|thumb|upright|Schopenhauer at age 58 on 16 May 1846]]
Schopenhauer believed that personality and [[intellect]] were inherited. He quotes Horace's saying, &quot;From the brave and good are the brave descended&quot; (''Odes'', iv, 4, 29) and Shakespeare's line from ''Cymbeline'', &quot;Cowards father cowards, and base things sire base&quot; (IV, 2) to reinforce his hereditarian argument.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, ''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. II, p. 519&lt;/ref&gt;
Mechanistically, Schopenhauer believed that a person inherits his level of intellect through his mother, and personal character through one's father.&lt;ref&gt;On the Suffering of the World, (1970), Page 35. Penguin Books-Great Ideas&lt;/ref&gt;
This belief in heritability of traits informed Schopenhauer's view of love –&amp;nbsp; placing it at the highest level of importance. For Schopenhauer the &quot;final aim of all love intrigues, be they comic or tragic, is really of more importance than all other ends in human life. What it all turns upon is nothing less than the composition of the next generation.... It is not the weal or woe of any one individual, but that of the human race to come, which is here at stake.&quot; This view of the importance for the species of whom we choose to love was reflected in his views on [[eugenics]] or good breeding. Here Schopenhauer wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;With our knowledge of the complete unalterability both of character and of mental faculties, we are led to the view that a real and thorough improvement of the human race might be reached not so much from outside as from within, not so much by theory and instruction as rather by the path of generation. Plato had something of the kind in mind when, in the fifth book of his ''Republic'', he explained his plan for increasing and improving his warrior caste. If we could [[castrate]] all [[criminals|scoundrels]] and stick all stupid geese in a convent, and give men of noble character a whole [[harem]], and procure men, and indeed thorough men, for all girls of intellect and understanding, then a generation would soon arise which would produce a better age than that of [[Pericles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schopenhauer | first = Arthur | title = The World as Will and Representation |editor=E. F. J. Payne |volume=II | publisher = Dover Publications | location = New York | year = 1969 | isbn = 978-0-486-21762-8 |page=527 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In another context, Schopenhauer reiterated his antidemocratic-eugenic thesis: &quot;If you want Utopian plans, I would say: the only solution to the problem is the [[despotism]] of the wise and noble members of a genuine aristocracy, a genuine nobility, achieved by [[mating]] the most magnanimous men with the cleverest and most gifted women. This proposal constitutes my Utopia and my Platonic Republic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Essays and Aphorisms'', trans. R.J. Hollingdale, Middlesex: London, 1970, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts (e.g., Keith Ansell-Pearson) have suggested that Schopenhauer's advocacy of anti-[[egalitarianism]] and eugenics influenced the neo-aristocratic philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, who initially considered Schopenhauer his mentor.&lt;ref&gt;''Nietzsche and modern German thought''

==== Animal welfare ====
As a consequence of his [[Monism|monistic]] philosophy, Schopenhauer was very concerned about the welfare of animals.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Gerhardt, &quot;Thinking With: Animals in Schopenhauer, Horkheimer and Adorno.&quot; Critical Theory and Animals. Ed. John Sanbonmatsu. Lanham: Rowland, 2011. 137–157.&lt;/ref&gt; For him, all individual animals, including humans, are essentially the same, being phenomenal manifestations of the one underlying Will. The word &quot;will&quot; designated, for him, force, power, impulse, energy, and desire; it is the closest word we have that can signify both the real essence of all external things and also our own direct, inner experience. Since everything is basically Will, then humans and animals are fundamentally the same and can recognize themselves in each other.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Unlike the intellect, it [the Will] does not depend on the perfection of the organism, but is essentially the same in all animals as that which is known to us so intimately. Accordingly, the animal has all the emotions of humans, such as joy, grief, fear, anger, love, hatred, strong desire, envy, and so on. The great difference between human and animal rests solely on the intellect's degrees of perfection.&quot; ''On the Will in Nature'', &quot;Physiology and Pathology.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, he claimed that a good person would have sympathy for animals, who are our fellow sufferers.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Compassion for animals is intimately associated with goodness of character, and it may be confidently asserted that he who is cruel to living creatures cannot be a good man.&lt;ref&gt;''[[On the basis of morality]]'', § 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nothing leads more definitely to a recognition of the identity of the essential nature in animal and human phenomena than a study of zoology and anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schopenhauer | first = Arthur | title = Philosophical Writings | publisher = Continuum | location = London | year = 1994 | isbn = 978-0-8264-0729-0 |page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The assumption that animals are without rights and the illusion that our treatment of them has no moral significance is a positively outrageous example of Western crudity and barbarity. Universal compassion is the only guarantee of morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ryder | first = Richard | title = Animal Revolution: Changing Attitudes Towards Speciesism | publisher = Berg Publishers | location = Oxford | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-1-85973-330-1 |page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1841, he praised the establishment, in London, of the [[Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]], and also the Animals' Friends Society in Philadelphia. Schopenhauer even went so far as to protest against the use of the pronoun &quot;it&quot; in reference to animals because it led to the treatment of them as though they were inanimate things.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;...in English all animals are of the neuter gender and so are represented by the pronoun 'it,' just as if they were inanimate things. The effect of this artifice is quite revolting, especially in the case of primates, such as dogs, monkeys, and the like....&quot; ''[[On the basis of morality]]'', § 19.&lt;/ref&gt; To reinforce his points, Schopenhauer referred to anecdotal reports of the look in the eyes of a monkey who had been shot&lt;ref&gt;&quot;I recall having read of an Englishman who, while hunting in India, had shot a monkey; he could not forget the look which the dying animal gave him, and since then had never again fired at monkeys.&quot; ''[[On the basis of morality]]'', § 19.&lt;/ref&gt; and also the grief of a baby elephant whose mother had been killed by a hunter.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[Sir William Harris] describes how he shot his first elephant, a female. The next morning he went to look for the dead animal; all the other elephants had fled from the neighborhood except a young one, who had spent the night with its dead mother. Forgetting all fear, he came toward the sportsmen with the clearest and liveliest evidence of inconsolable grief, and put his tiny trunk round them in order to appeal to them for help. Harris says he was then filled with real remorse for what he had done, and felt as if he had committed a murder.&quot; ''[[On the basis of morality]]'', § 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was very attached to his succession of pet poodles. Schopenhauer criticized [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza's]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;His contempt for animals, who, as mere things for our use, are declared by him to be without rights,...in conjunction with Pantheism, is at the same time absurd and abominable.&quot; ''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. 2, Chapter 50.&lt;/ref&gt; belief that animals are to be used as a mere means for the satisfaction of humans.&lt;ref&gt;Spinoza, ''Ethics'', Pt. IV, Prop. XXXVII, Note I.: &quot;Still I do not deny that beasts feel: what I deny is, that we may not consult our own advantage and use them as we please, treating them in a way which best suits us; for their nature is not like ours....&quot; This is the exact opposite of Schopenhauer's doctrine. Also, ''ibid.'', Appendix, 26, &quot;whatsoever there be in nature beside man, a regard for our advantage does not call on us to preserve, but to preserve or destroy according to its various capacities, and to adapt to our use as best we may.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Such are the matters which I engage to prove in Prop. xviii of this Part, whereby it is plain that the law against the slaughtering of animals is founded rather on vain superstition and womanish pity than on sound reason. The rational quest of what is useful to us further teaches us the necessity of associating ourselves with our fellow-men, but not with beasts, or things, whose nature is different from our own; we have the same rights in respect to them as they have in respect to us. Nay, as everyone's right is defined by his virtue, or power, men have far greater rights over beasts than beasts have over men. Still I affirm that beasts feel. But I also affirm that we may consult our own advantage and use them as we please, treating them in the way which best suits us; for their nature is not like ours, and their emotions are naturally different from human emotions.&quot; ''Ethics'', Part 4, Prop. 37, Note 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Views on homosexuality and pederasty ====
Schopenhauer was also one of the first philosophers since the days of [[Greek philosophy]] to address the subject of male homosexuality. In the third, expanded edition of ''The World as Will and Representation'' (1859), Schopenhauer added an appendix to his chapter on the &quot;Metaphysics of Sexual Love&quot;. He also wrote that homosexuality did have the benefit of preventing ill-begotten children. Concerning this, he stated, &quot;... the vice we are considering appears to work directly against the aims and ends of nature, and that in a matter that is all important and of the greatest concern to her, it must in fact serve these very aims, although only indirectly, as a means for preventing greater evils.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schopenhauer|1969|p=566}}. He wrote that only those who were too old or too young to reproduce strong, healthy children would resort to pederasty (Schopenhauer considered pederasty to be in itself a [[vice]]).&quot;The World as Will and Representation: Volume Two&quot;. Dover&lt;/ref&gt; Shrewdly anticipating the interpretive distortion, on the part of the popular mind, of his attempted scientific ''explanation'' of [[pederasty]] as personal ''advocacy'' (when he had otherwise described the act, in terms of spiritual ethics, as an &quot;objectionable aberration&quot;), Schopenhauer sarcastically concludes the appendix with the statement that &quot;by expounding these paradoxical ideas, I wanted to grant to the professors of philosophy a small favour, for they are very disconcerted by the ever-increasing publicization of my philosophy which they so carefully concealed. I have done so by giving them the opportunity of slandering me by saying that I defend and commend pederasty.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schopenhauer|1969|p=567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intellectual interests and affinities ===
Schopenhauer learned from [[Christian philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Representation, Vol. 2, trans. E. Payne, (New York: Dover Publishing Inc., 1966), 639. &quot;the Veda says; Finditur nodus cordis, dissolvuntur omnes dubitationes, ejusque opera evanescunt. In agreement with this view, the fifteenth sermon of Meister Eckhart will be found well worth reading.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Representation, Vol. 2, trans. E. Payne, (New York: Dover Publishing Inc., 1966), 635. &quot;Even the conclusion of Seneca's last letter is in keeping with this... which certainly seems to indicate an influence of Christianity.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 48 (Dover page 616), &quot;The ascetic tendency is certainly unmistakable in [[Early Christianity|genuine and original Christianity]], as it was developed in the writings of the [[Church Fathers]] from the kernel of the [[New Testament]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source-inline|date=December 2013}}

==== Indology ====
Schopenhauer read the Latin translation of the [[Upanisad|Upanishads]] which had been translated by French writer [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron|Anquetil du Perron]] from the Persian translation of Prince [[Dara Shikoh]] entitled ''Sirre-Akbar'' (&quot;The Great Secret&quot;). He was so impressed by their philosophy that he called them &quot;the production of the highest human wisdom,&quot; and considered them to contain superhuman conceptions. The Upanishads was a great source of inspiration to Schopenhauer, and writing about them he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the most satisfying and elevating reading (with the exception of the original text) which is possible in the world; it has been the solace of my life and will be the solace of my death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=John James|title=Oriental enlightenment|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|page=68|isbn=978-0-415-13376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is well known that the book ''Oupnekhat'' (Upanishad) always lay open on his table, and he invariably studied it before sleeping at night. He called the opening up of Sanskrit literature &quot;the greatest gift of our century&quot;, and predicted that the philosophy and knowledge of the Upanishads would become the cherished faith of the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophy.ru/library/asiatica/indica/authors/motives.html|title=Western Indologists: A Study in Motives|last=Dutt|first=Purohit Bhagavan|accessdate=9 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer was first introduced to the 1802 Latin [[Upanishad]] translation through Friedrich Majer.     They met during the winter of 1813–1814 in [[Weimar]] at the home of Schopenhauer’s mother according to the biographer Sanfranski.    Majer was a follower of [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], and an early [[Indologist]].     Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of the Indic texts, however, until the summer of 1814.     Sansfranski maintains that between 1815 and 1817, Schopenhauer had another important cross-pollination with Indian Thought in [[Dresden]]. This was through his neighbor of two years, [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause]].    Krause was then a minor and rather unorthodox philosopher who attempted to mix his own ideas with that of ancient Indian wisdom. Krause had also mastered [[Sanskrit]], unlike Schopenhauer, and the two developed a professional relationship.     It was from Krause that Schopenhauer learned [[meditation]] and received the closest thing to expert advice concerning Indian thought.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher McCoy, 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

Most noticeable, in the case of Schopenhauer’s work, was the significance of the [[Chandogya Upanishad]], whose [[Mahavakya]], [[Tat Tvam Asi]] is mentioned throughout ''The World as Will and Representation''.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher McCoy, 54–56&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Buddhism ====
Schopenhauer noted a correspondence between his doctrines and the [[Four Noble Truths]] of [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;Abelson, Peter (April 1993).
[http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/peter2.htm Schopenhauer and Buddhism]. ''Philosophy East and West
Volume 43, Number 2,'' pp. 255–278. University of Hawaii Press. Retrieved on: 12 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities centered on the principles that life involves suffering, that suffering is caused by desire ([[taṇhā]]), and that the extinction of desire leads to liberation. Thus three of the four &quot;truths of the Buddha&quot; correspond to Schopenhauer's doctrine of the will.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Janaway|Janaway]], Christopher, ''Self and World in Schopenhauer's Philosophy'', p. 28&amp;nbsp;f.&lt;/ref&gt; In Buddhism, however, while greed and lust are always unskillful, desire is ethically variable – it can be skillful, unskillful, or neutral.&lt;ref name=&quot;David Burton 2004, page 22&quot;&gt;David Burton, &quot;Buddhism, Knowledge and Liberation: A Philosophical Study.&quot; Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2004, page 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Schopenhauer, Will had [[ontology|ontological]] primacy over the [[intellect]]; in other words, desire is understood to be prior to thought. Schopenhauer felt this was similar to notions of [[puruṣārtha]] or goals of life in [[Vedānta]] [[Hinduism]].

In Schopenhauer's philosophy, denial of the will is attained by either:
* personal experience of an extremely great suffering that leads to loss of the will to live; or
* knowledge of the essential nature of life in the world through observation of the suffering of other people.

However, Buddhist [[nirvāṇa]] is not equivalent to the condition that Schopenhauer described as denial of the will. Nirvāṇa is not the extinguishing of the ''person'' as some Western scholars have thought, but only the &quot;extinguishing&quot; (the literal meaning of nirvana) of the flames of greed, hatred, and delusion that assail a person's character.&lt;ref&gt;John J. Holder, ''Early Buddhist Discourses.'' Hackett Publishing Company, 2006, page xx.&lt;/ref&gt; Occult historian [[Joscelyn Godwin]] (1945– ) stated, &quot;It was Buddhism that inspired the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, and, through him, attracted [[Richard Wagner]].&lt;ref&gt;Godwin, J: ''Arktos: The Polar Myth in Science, Symbolism, and Nazi Survival'', page 38. Adventures Unlimited Press, 1996, ISBN 978-0-932813-35-0&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Orientalism]] reflected the struggle of the German Romantics, in the words of [[Leon Poliakov]], to free themselves from [[Judeo-Christian]] fetters&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Arktos'', p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; In contradistinction to Godwin's claim that Buddhism inspired Schopenhauer, the philosopher himself made the following statement in his discussion of religions:&lt;ref&gt;
&quot;Schopenhauer is often said to be the first, or indeed the only, modern Western philosopher of any note to attempt any integration of his work with Eastern ways of thinking. That he was the first is surely true, but the claim that he was ''influenced'' by Indian thought needs some qualification. There is a remarkable correspondence, at least in broad terms, between some of the central Schopenhauerian doctrines and Buddhism: notably in the views that empirical existence is suffering, that suffering originates in desires, and that salvation can be attained by the extinction of desires. These three 'truths of the Buddha' are mirrored closely in the essential structure of the doctrine of the will (On this, see Dorothea W. Dauer, ''Schopenhauer as Transmitter of Buddhist Ideas''. Note also the discussion by Bryan Magee, ''The Philosophy of Schopenhauer'', pp. 14–15, 316–21). Janaway, Christopher, ''Self and World in Schopenhauer's Philosophy'', p. 28&amp;nbsp;f.
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If I wished to take the results of my philosophy as the standard of truth, I should have to concede to Buddhism pre-eminence over the others. In any case, it must be a pleasure to me to see my doctrine in such close agreement with a religion that the majority of men on earth hold as their own, for this numbers far more followers than any other. And this agreement must be yet the more pleasing to me, inasmuch as ''in my philosophizing I have certainly not been under its influence'' [emphasis added]. For up till 1818, when my work appeared, there was to be found in Europe only a very few accounts of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The World as Will and Representation]]’’, Vol. 2, Ch. 17&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Buddhist philosopher [[Nishitani Keiji]], however, sought to distance Buddhism from Schopenhauer.&lt;ref&gt;''Artistic detachment in Japan and the West: psychic distance in comparative aesthetics''. S Odin – 2001 – Univ of Hawaii Press&lt;/ref&gt;
While Schopenhauer's philosophy may sound rather mystical in such a summary, his [[methodology]] was resolutely [[empirical]], rather than speculative or transcendental:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Philosophy ... is a science, and as such has no articles of faith; accordingly, in it nothing can be assumed as existing except what is either positively given empirically, or demonstrated through indubitable conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;''Parerga &amp; Paralipomena'', vol. I, p. 106., trans. E.F.J. Payne.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also note:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This actual world of what is knowable, in which we are and which is in us, remains both the material and the limit of our consideration.&lt;ref&gt;''World as Will and Representation'', vol. I, p. 273, trans. E.F.J. Payne.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The argument that Buddhism affected Schopenhauer’s philosophy more than any other [[Dharma|Dharmic]] faith loses more credence when viewed in light of the fact that Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of Buddhism until after the publication of ''The World as Will and Representation'' in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher McCoy, 3&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have started to revise earlier views about Schopenhauer's discovery of Buddhism. Proof of early interest and influence, however, appears in Schopenhauer's 1815/16 notes (transcribed and translated by Urs App) about Buddhism. They are included in a recent case study that traces Schopenhauer's interest in Buddhism and documents its influence.&lt;ref&gt;
App, Urs [http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp200_schopenhauer.pdf Arthur Schopenhauer and China. ''Sino-Platonic Papers'' Nr. 200 (April 2010)] (PDF, 8.7&amp;nbsp;Mb PDF, 164 p.; Schopenhauer's early notes on Buddhism reproduced in Appendix). This study provides an overview of the actual discovery of Buddhism by Schopenhauer.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==
Schopenhauer said he was influenced by the [[Upanishads]], [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Plato]]. References to [[Eastern philosophy|Eastern philosophy and religion]] appear frequently in Schopenhauer's writing.

P Abelsen, H Amsterdam, A Schopenhauer – ''Philosophy East &amp; West'', 1993&lt;/ref&gt; that his philosophy could not have been conceived before these teachings were available.

Concerning the Upanishads and [[Vedas]], he writes in ''The World as Will and Representation'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;If the reader has also received the benefit of the Vedas, the access to which by means of the Upanishads is in my eyes the greatest privilege which this still young century (1818) may claim before all previous centuries, if then the reader, I say, has received his initiation in primeval Indian wisdom, and received it with an open heart, he will be prepared in the very best way for hearing what I have to tell him. It will not sound to him strange, as to many others, much less disagreeable; for I might, if it did not sound conceited, contend that every one of the detached statements which constitute the Upanishads, may be deduced as a necessary result from the fundamental thoughts which I have to enunciate, though those deductions themselves are by no means to be found there.&lt;ref&gt;''The World as Will and Representation'' Preface to the first edition, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Critique of Kant and Hegel ==

=== Critique of the Kantian philosophy ===
{{Main|Critique of the Kantian philosophy}}
{{See also|On the Basis of Morality|Schopenhauer's criticism of Kant's schemata}}
Schopenhauer accepted Kant's double-aspect of the universe – the [[phenomena]]l (world of experience) and the [[noumenon|noumenal]] (the true world, independent of experience). Some commentators suggest that Schopenhauer claimed that the noumenon, or thing-in-itself, was the basis for Schopenhauer's concept of the [[will (philosophy)|will]]. Other commentators suggest that Schopenhauer considered [[will (philosophy)|will]] to be only a subset of the &quot;thing-in-itself&quot; class, namely that which we can most directly experience.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Magee, ''Misunderstanding Schopenhauer'', [[Institute of Germanic and Romance Studies]], University of London, 1990, ISBN 978-0-85457-148-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer's identification of the Kantian ''noumenon'' (i.e., the actually existing entity) with what he termed &quot;will&quot; deserves some explanation. The noumenon was what Kant called the ''Ding an Sich'' (the Thing in Itself), the reality that is the foundation of our [[sense|sensory]] and [[mind|mental]] representations of an external world. In Kantian terms, those sensory and mental representations are mere phenomena. Schopenhauer departed from Kant in his description of the relationship between the phenomenon and the noumenon. According to Kant, things-in-themselves ground the phenomenal representations in our minds; Schopenhauer, on the other hand, believed phenomena and noumena to be two different sides of the same coin. Noumena do not ''cause'' phenomena, but rather phenomena are simply the way by which our minds perceive the noumena, according to the [[principle of sufficient reason]]. This is explained more fully in Schopenhauer's doctoral thesis, ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]''.

Schopenhauer's second major departure from Kant's epistemology concerns the body. Kant's philosophy was formulated as a response to the radical [[philosophical skepticism]] of David Hume, who claimed that causality could not be observed empirically. Schopenhauer begins by arguing that Kant's demarcation between external objects, knowable only as phenomena, and the Thing in Itself of noumenon, contains a significant omission. There is, in fact, one physical object we know more intimately than we know any object of sense perception: our own body.

We know our [[human anatomy|human bodies]] have boundaries and occupy space, the same way other objects known only through our named senses do. Though we seldom think of our body as a physical object, we know even before reflection that it shares some of an object's properties. We understand that a watermelon cannot successfully occupy the same space as an oncoming truck; we know that if we tried to repeat the experiment with our own body, we would obtain similar results – we know this even if we do not understand the [[physics]] involved.

We know that our consciousness inhabits a physical body, similar to other physical objects only known as phenomena. Yet our consciousness is not commensurate with our body. Most of us possess the power of voluntary motion. We usually are not aware of the breathing of our [[human lung|lungs]] or the beating of our [[human heart|heart]] unless somehow our attention is called to them. Our ability to control either is limited. Our [[kidney]]s command our attention on their schedule rather than one we choose. Few of us have any idea what our [[liver]] is doing right now, though this organ is as needful as lungs, heart, or kidneys. The conscious mind is the servant, not the master, of these and other organs; these organs have an agenda which the conscious mind did not choose, and over which it has limited power.

When Schopenhauer identifies the ''noumenon'' with the desires, needs, and impulses in us that we name &quot;will,&quot; what he is saying is that we participate in the reality of an otherwise unachievable world outside the mind through will. We cannot ''prove'' that our mental picture of an outside world corresponds with a reality by reasoning; through will, we know – without thinking – that the world can stimulate us. We suffer fear, or desire: these states arise involuntarily; they arise prior to reflection; they arise even when the conscious mind would prefer to hold them at bay. The rational mind is, for Schopenhauer, a leaf borne along in a stream of pre-reflective and largely unconscious emotion. That stream is will, and through will, if not through logic, we can participate in the underlying reality beyond mere phenomena. It is for this reason that Schopenhauer identifies the ''noumenon'' with what we call our will.

In his criticism of Kant, Schopenhauer claimed that sensation and understanding are separate and distinct abilities. Yet, for Kant, an object is known through each of them. Kant wrote: &quot;... [T]here are two stems of human knowledge ... namely, sensibility and understanding, objects being given by the former [sensibility] and thought by the latter [understanding].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 15&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer disagreed. He asserted that mere sense impressions, not objects, are given by sensibility. According to Schopenhauer, objects are intuitively perceived by understanding and are discursively thought by reason (Kant had claimed that (1) the understanding thinks objects through concepts and that (2) reason seeks the unconditioned or ultimate answer to &quot;why?&quot;). Schopenhauer said that Kant's mistake regarding perception resulted in all of the obscurity and difficult confusion that is exhibited in the Transcendental Analytic section of his critique.

Lastly, Schopenhauer departed from Kant in how he interpreted the [[Platonic forms|Platonic ideas]].  In ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' Schopenhauer explicitly stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...Kant used the word [Idea] wrongly as well as illegitimately, although Plato had already taken possession of it, and used it most appropriately.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Instead Schopenhauer relied upon the [[Neoplatonist]] interpretation of the biographer [[Diogenes Laërtius]] from ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]''. In reference to Plato’s Ideas, Schopenhauer quotes Laërtius verbatim in an explanatory footnote.

Diogenes Laërtius (III, 12) Plato ideas in natura velut exemplaria dixit subsistere; cetera his esse similia, ad istarum similitudinem consistencia.
(Plato teaches that the Ideas exist in nature, so to speak, as patterns or prototypes, and that the remainder of things only resemble them, and exist as their copies.)&lt;ref&gt;McCoy, Christopher Patrick. 2009. Thou Art That: Schopenhauer's Philosophy and the Chandogya Upanishad. Master's thesis, James Madison University: 10–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critique of Hegel ===
Schopenhauer expressed his dislike for the philosophy of his contemporary [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] many times in his published works. The following quotations are typical:

:If I were to say that the so-called philosophy of this fellow Hegel is a colossal piece of mystification which will yet provide posterity with an inexhaustible theme for laughter at our times, that it is a [[pseudophilosophy|pseudo-philosophy]] paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking, and, by the most outrageous misuse of language, putting in its place the hollowest, most senseless, thoughtless, and, as is confirmed by its success, most stupefying verbiage, I should be quite right.

:Further, if I were to say that this summus philosophus [...] scribbled nonsense quite unlike any mortal before him, so that whoever could read his most eulogized work, the so-called ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit|Phenomenology of the Mind]]'', without feeling as if he were in a madhouse, would qualify as an inmate for [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bedlam]], I should be no less right.&lt;ref&gt;[[On the Basis of Morality]], pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

:At first Fichte and Schelling shine as the heroes of this epoch; to be followed by the man who is quite unworthy even of them, and greatly their inferior in point of talent --- I mean the stupid and clumsy charlatan Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;[[On the Basis of Morality]], p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his Foreword to the first edition of his work ''Die beiden Grundprobleme der Ethik'', Schopenhauer suggested that he had shown Hegel to have fallen prey to the ''[[Post hoc ergo propter hoc]]'' fallacy.

Schopenhauer suggested that Hegel's works were filled with &quot;castles of abstraction,&quot; and that Hegel used deliberately impressive but ultimately vacuous verbiage.&lt;ref name=&quot;orientalia.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orientalia.org/wisdom/Philosophy/Pseudophilosophy.shtml |title=Philosophy: Pseudophilosophy |publisher=Orientalia.org |accessdate=12 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also thought that his glorification of church and state were designed for personal advantage and had little to do with the search for philosophical [[truth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;orientalia.org&quot;/&gt; For instance, the [[Right Hegelians]] interpreted Hegel as viewing the Prussian state of his day as perfect and the goal of all history up until then.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;... the Hegelians who, in complete unsmiling seriousness, were airing the question of what the further content of world history could possibly be, now that in the Hegelian philosophy the world spirit had reached the goal, the knowledge of itself.&quot; Safranski, p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The British philosopher and historian [[Bertrand Russell]] deemed Schopenhauer's doctrine insincere, because judging by his life:

&quot;He habitually dined well, at a good restaurant; he had many trivial love-affairs, which were sensual but not passionate; he was exceedingly quarrelsome and unusually avaricious. ... It is hard to find in his life evidences of any virtue except kindness to animals ... In all other respects he was completely selfish. It is difficult to believe that a man who was profoundly convinced of the virtue of [[asceticism]] and resignation would never have made any attempt to embody his convictions in his practice.&quot;&lt;ref name=Insincere&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|title=HISTORY OF WESTERN PHILOSOPHY|year=1946|publisher=George Allen and Unwin LTD|location=Start of 2nd paragraph|pages=786}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
[[File:Arthur Schopenhauer by Wilhelm Busch.jpeg|thumb|upright|Caricature of Schopenhauer by [[Wilhelm Busch]] (1832–1908)]]

Schopenhauer has had a massive influence upon later thinkers, though more so in the [[arts]] (especially literature and music) and [[psychology]] than in philosophy. His popularity peaked in the early twentieth century, especially during the [[Modernist]] era, and waned somewhat thereafter. Nevertheless, a number of recent publications have reinterpreted and modernised the study of Schopenhauer. His theory is also being explored by some modern philosophers as a precursor to [[evolutionary theory]] and modern evolutionary psychology.&lt;ref&gt;In the book ''Straw Dogs'', John Gray upheld Schopenhauer as one of the few philosophers who has dedicated himself to studying Eastern philosophy as well as Western philosophy. The book argues against free will, and states that humans have much more in common with animals than is commonly admitted in the West. Schopenhauer is praised for his attitude towards animals, and for having addressed the brutality of much of human life.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Wagner]], writing in his autobiography, remembered his first impression that Schopenhauer left on him (when he read ''World as Will and Representation''):
:Schopenhauer’s book was never completely out of my mind, and by the following summer I had studied it from cover to cover four times. It had a radical influence on my whole life.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, Roger. Schopenhauer's world. The New Criterion, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

Wagner also commented that &quot;serious mood, which was trying to find ecstatic expression&quot; created by Schopenhauer inspired the conception of Tristan und Isolde.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=2OUsAAAAYAAJ&amp;vq=%22It+was+some+such+mood+that+inspired+the+conception+of+a+Tristan+und+Isolde.%22&amp;pg=PA617&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title= My life}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Tristan und Isolde#Influence of Schopenhauer on Tristan und Isolde|Influence of Schopenhauer on Tristan und Isolde]].

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] owed the awakening of his philosophical interest to reading ''The World as Will and Representation'' and admitted that he was one of the few philosophers that he respected, dedicating to him his essay ''Schopenhauer als Erzieher''&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Schopenhauer as Educator|Schopenhauer as Educator]]&lt;/ref&gt; one of his ''[[Untimely Meditations]]''.

[[Jorge Luis Borges]] remarked that the reason he had never attempted to write a systematic account of his world view, despite his penchant for philosophy and metaphysics in particular, was because Schopenhauer had already written it for him.{{sfn|Magee|1997|p=413}}

As a teenager, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] adopted Schopenhauer's epistemological idealism. However, after his study of the philosophy of mathematics, he rejected epistemological idealism for [[Gottlob Frege]]'s conceptual realism. In later years, Wittgenstein was highly dismissive of Schopenhauer, describing him as an ultimately &quot;shallow&quot; thinker: &quot;Schopenhauer has quite a crude mind... where real depth starts, his comes to an end&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Culture &amp; Value, p.24, 1933–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, Norman. Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Memoir. Oxford University Press, 1958, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Gilbert Ryle]] read Schopenhauer's works as a student, but later largely forgot them. He unwittingly recycled ideas from Schopenhauer in his ''[[The Concept of Mind]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Magee|first=Bryan|title=Confessions of a Philosopher|year=1997}}, Ch. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Angola''', officially the '''Republic of Angola''' ({{lang-pt|República de Angola|}} {{IPA-pt|ʁɛˈpublikɐ dɨ ɐ̃ˈɡɔlɐ|pron}}; [[Kikongo]], [[Kimbundu]], [[Umbundu]]: ''Repubilika ya Ngola''), is a country in Southern Africa bordered by [[Namibia]] on the south, the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] on the north, and [[Zambia]] on the east; its west coast is on the Atlantic Ocean and [[Luanda]] is its capital city. The [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]] province of [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]] has borders with the [[Republic of the Congo]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].

The Portuguese were present in some – mostly coastal – points of the territory of what is now Angola, from the 16th to the 19th century, interacting in diverse ways with the peoples who lived there. In the 19th century, they slowly and hesitantly began to establish themselves in the interior. Angola as a [[Portuguese West Africa|Portuguese colony]] encompassing the present territory was not established before the end of the 19th century, and &quot;effective occupation&quot;, as required by the [[Berlin Conference (1884)]] was achieved only by the 1920s after the [[Mbunda people|Mbunda]] resistance and abduction of their King, [[Mwene Mbandu Kapova I of Mbunda|Mwene Mbandu I Lyondthzi Kapova]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SeeRene&quot;&gt;See René Pélissier: ''Les Guerres grises: Résistance et revoltes en Angola (1845–1941)'', Montamets/Orgeval: Éditions Pélissier, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Independence was achieved in 1975, after a protracted liberation war. After independence, Angola was the scene of an intense [[Angolan Civil War|civil war from 1975 to 2002]]. Despite the civil war, areas such as [[Baixa de Cassanje]] continue a lineage of kings which have included the former King [[Kambamba Kulaxingo]] and current King Dianhenga Aspirante Mjinji Kulaxingo. 

The country has vast mineral and petroleum reserves, and its economy has on average grown at a double-digit pace since the 1990s, especially since the end of the civil war. In spite of this, standards of living remain low for the majority of the population, and [[life expectancy]] and [[infant mortality|infant mortality rates]] in Angola are among the worst in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html Life expectancy at birth] www.cia.gov (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Angola is considered to be economically disparate, with the majority of the nation's wealth concentrated in a disproportionately small sector of the population.

Angola is a member state of the [[African Union]], the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]], the [[Latin Union]] and the [[Southern African Development Community]].

==Etymology==
The name ''Angola'' comes from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] colonial name ''[[Angola (Portugal)|Reino de Angola]] (Kingdom of Angola)'', appearing as early as [[Dias de Novais]]'s 1571 charter.&lt;ref&gt;Heywood, Linda M. &amp; Thornton, John K. ''[http://books.google.com.hk/books?id=S42CypbRTlQC&amp;pg=PA82 Central Africans, Atlantic Creoles, and the foundation of the Americas, 1585–1660],'' p. 82. Cambridge University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[toponym]] was derived by the Portuguese from the title ''[[List of Ngolas of Ndongo|ngola]]'' held by the kings of [[Kingdom of Ndongo|Ndongo]]. Ndongo was a kingdom in the highlands, between the [[Kwanza River|Kwanza]] and [[Lukala River]]s, nominally tributary to the [[Kingdom of Kongo|king of Kongo]] but which was seeking greater independence during the 16th century.

== History ==
{{Main|History of Angola}}

=== Early migrations and political units ===
[[File:KingdomNdongo1711.png|thumb|left|250px|Territory comprising [[Kingdom of Ndongo]], presente-day Angola]]
[[Khoisan]] [[hunter-gatherer]]s are the earliest known modern human inhabitants of the area. They were largely absorbed and/or replaced by [[Bantu peoples]] during the [[Bantu expansion|Bantu migrations]], though small numbers remain in parts of southern Angola to the present day. The Bantu came from the north, probably from somewhere near the present-day Republic of [[Cameroon]] and [[Sudan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaa-umati.co.uk/Bantu%20in%20Ancient%20Egypt.htm The Bantu in Ancient Egypt, citing sources: Alfred M M'Imanyara 'The Restatement of Bantu Origin and Meru History' published by Longman Kenya, 1992 - Social Science - 170 pages, ISBN 9966 49 832 x]&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of the Bantu took many centuries and gave rise to various groups who took on different ethnic characteristics.

During this time, the Bantu established a number of political units (&quot;kingdoms&quot;, &quot;empires&quot;) in most parts of what today is Angola. The best known of these is the [[Kingdom of the Kongo]] that had its centre in the northwest of contemporary Angola, but included important regions in the west of present day [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Republic of Congo]], and in southern [[Gabon]]. It established trade routes with other trading cities and civilizations up and down the coast of southwestern and West Africa and even with the [[Great Zimbabwe]] [[Mutapa Empire]], but engaged in little or no transoceanic trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Story of Africa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1624_story_of_africa/page45.shtml |title=The Story of Africa |publisher=BBC |accessdate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others include the [[Mbunda people|Mbunda]], whose [[Mbunda Kingdom|Kingdom]] was established in the fifteenth century&lt;ref&gt;Almanac of African Peoples &amp; Nations page 523, Social Science By Muḥammad Zuhdī Yakan, Transaction Publishers, Putgers – The State University, New Jersey, ISBN 1-5600-433-9&lt;/ref&gt; at the confluence of Kwilu and Kasai rivers, in the south of present day Democratic Republic of the Congo, after a misunderstanding in Kola, also known as the origin of the Lunda and the Luba Kingdoms.

They reached what is now Angola in the sixteenth century, where they encountered the Khoisan, Bushmen and other groups considerably less technologically advanced than themselves, whom they easily dominated with their superior knowledge of metal-working, ceramics and agriculture.

=== Portuguese colonization ===
{{Main|Colonial history of Angola|Angola (Portugal)}}
[[File:Queen Nzinga 1657.png|thumb|left|[[Queen Nzinga]] in peace negotiations with the Portuguese governor in [[Luanda]], 1657.]]
[[File:Kongo audience.jpg|thumb|left||An image depicting Portuguese encounter with Kongo Royal family]]
The geographical areas now designated as Angola entered into contact with the Portuguese in the late 15th century, concretely in 1483, when Portugal established relations with the [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo]] State, which stretched from modern [[Gabon]] in the north to the [[Kwanza River]] in the south. In this context, they established a small trade post at the port of Mpinda, in [[Soyo]]. The Portuguese explorer [[Paulo Dias de Novais]] founded [[Luanda]] in 1575 as &quot;São Paulo de Loanda&quot;, with a hundred families of settlers and four hundred soldiers. [[Benguela]], a Portuguese fort from 1587 which became a town in 1617, was another important early settlement they founded and ruled. The Portuguese would establish several settlements, forts and trading posts along the coastal strip of current-day Angola, which relied on [[Slavery in Angola|slave trade]], commerce in raw materials, and exchange of goods for survival.

The [[Atlantic slave trade]] provided a large number of black slaves to merchants and slave dealers in Angola.&lt;ref name=Fleisch&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Fleisch | first = Axel |title = Angola: Slave Trade, Abolition of | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of African History 3-Volume Set|editor-last = Shillington | editor-first = Kevin | volume = 1 | pages = 131–133| publisher = Routledge | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-579-58245-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; European traders would export manufactured goods to the coast of Africa where they would be exchanged for slaves. Within the [[Portuguese Empire]], most black African slaves were traded to Portuguese merchants who bought them to sell as cheap labour for use on Brazilian agricultural plantations. This trade would last until the first half of the 19th century. According to [[John Iliffe]], &quot;Portuguese records of Angola from the 16th century show that a great [[famine]] occurred on average every seventy years; accompanied by epidemic disease, it might kill one-third or one-half of the population, destroying the demographic growth of a generation and forcing colonists back into the river valleys&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;John Iliffe (2007) [http://books.google.com/books?id=bNGN2URP_rUC&amp;pg=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Africans: the history of a continent'']. Cambridge University Press. p.68. ISBN 0-521-68297-5&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portuguese gradually took control of the coastal strip during the 16th century by a series of treaties and wars, forming the Portuguese colony of Angola. Taking advantage of the [[Portuguese Restoration War]], the Dutch occupied [[Luanda]] from 1641 to 1648, where they allied with local peoples, consolidating their colonial rule against the remaining Portuguese resistance. In 1648, a fleet under the command of [[Salvador de Sá]] retook Luanda for Portugal and initiated a conquest of the lost territories, which restored Portugal to its former possessions by 1650. Treaties regulated relations with [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo]] in 1649 and Njinga's Kingdom of [[Matamba]] and [[Ndongo]] in 1656. The conquest of [[Pungo Andongo]] in 1671 was the last major Portuguese expansion from Luanda outwards, as attempts to invade Kongo in 1670 and Matamba in 1681 failed. Portugal also expanded its territory behind the colony of Benguela to some extent, but until the 19th century the inroads from Luanda and Benguela were very limited, and Portugal had neither the intention nor the means to carry out a large scale territorial occupation and colonization.

[[Image:King Mwene Mbandu Lyondthzi Kapova I.jpg||thumb|left|[[Mwene Mbandu Kapova I of Mbunda|King Mwene Mbandu I Lyondthzi Kapova]], the 21st [[Mbunda Kingdom|Monarch of the Mbunda Kingdom]]]]
[[File:Embarque tropas para angola 1.jpg|thumb|Portuguese troops heading for Angola, during [[German campaign in Angola|World War I]].]]
The process resulted in few gains until the 1880s. Development of the hinterland began after the [[Berlin Conference]] in 1885 fixed the colony's borders, and British and Portuguese investment fostered mining, railways, and agriculture based on various forced-labour systems. Full Portuguese administrative control of the hinterland did not establish itself until the beginning of the 20th century, after the [[Mbunda people|Mbunda]] resistance and abduction of their King, [[Mwene Mbandu Kapova I of Mbunda|Mwene Mbandu I Lyondthzi Kapova]],&lt;ref name=&quot;SeeRene&quot; /&gt; eventually dislodged the [[Mbunda Kingdom]] extending Angolan territory over Mbundaland.&lt;ref name=&quot;RobertPapstein&quot; /&gt; In 1951 the Portuguese government designated the colony as an overseas province of Portugal, called the [[Overseas Province of Angola]].

Portugal had a minimalist presence in Angola for nearly five hundred years, and early calls for independence provoked little reaction amongst the population. More overtly political organisations first appeared in the 1950s and began to make organised demands for [[self-determination]], especially in international forums such as the [[Non-Aligned Movement]].

The [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portuguese regime]], meanwhile, refused to accede to the demands for independence, provoking an armed conflict that started in 1961 when black guerrillas attacked both white and black civilians in cross-border operations in northeastern Angola. The war came to be known as the [[Portuguese Colonial War|Colonial War]]. In this struggle, the principal protagonists included, the [[People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola]] (MPLA)), founded in 1956, the [[National Front for the Liberation of Angola]] (FNLA), which appeared in 1961 and the [[National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]] (UNITA), founded in 1966.

After many years of conflict that led to the weakening of all the insurgent parties, Angola gained its independence on 11 November 1975, after the [[Carnation Revolution|1974 coup d'état]] in Lisbon, Portugal, which overthrew the Portuguese regime headed by [[Marcelo Caetano]].

Portugal's [[Movimento das Forças Armadas|new revolutionary leaders]] began in 1974 a process of political change at home and accepted independence for its former colonies abroad. In Angola a fight for dominance broke out immediately between the three nationalist movements. The events prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens, creating up to 300 000 destitute Portuguese [[refugee]]s—the ''[[White African#Portuguese in Africa|retornados]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913229-1,00.html Dismantling the Portuguese Empire], [[Time Magazine]] (Monday, 7 July 1975)
&lt;/ref&gt;
The new Portuguese government tried to mediate an understanding between the three competing movements, and succeeded in agreeing, on paper, to form a common government, but in the end none of the African parties respected the commitments made, and military force resolved the issue.

=== Independence and civil war ===
[[File:View over Lunda 3.JPG|thumb|140px|Monument on memory of [[Agostinho Neto]] and [[Angolan War of Independence|Angolan struggle for independence]]]]
{{Main|Angolan War of Independence|Angolan Civil War}}
{{Further|1980s in Angola|1990s in Angola}}
After independence in November 1975, Angola faced a devastating civil war which lasted several decades and claimed millions of lives and produced many refugees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norrie MacQueen&quot;&gt;[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0001-9909(199804)97%3A387%3C276%3ATDOPAM%3E2.0.CO%3B2-C The Decolonization of Portuguese Africa: Metropolitan Revolution and the Dissolution of Empire by Norrie MacQueen – Mozambique since Independence: Confronting Leviathan by Margaret Hall, Tom Young – Author of Review: Stuart A. Notholt African Affairs, Vol. 97, No. 387 (Apr., 1998), pp. 276–278], [[JSTOR]]&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Alvor Agreement|negotiations held in Portugal]], itself under severe social and political turmoil and uncertainty due to the [[Carnation Revolution|April 1974 revolution]], Angola's three main guerrilla groups agreed to establish a transitional government in January 1975.

Within two months, however, the FNLA, MPLA and UNITA were fighting each other and the country was well on its way to being divided into zones controlled by rival armed political groups. The superpowers were quickly drawn into the conflict, which became a flash point for the [[Cold War]]. The United States, [[Zaire]] (today's [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]) and South Africa supported the FNLA and UNITA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article4068.htm |title=Americas Third World War: How 6 million People Were killed in CIA secret wars against third world countries |publisher=Informationclearinghouse.info |date=16 November 1981 |accessdate=27 June 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100629015838/http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article4068.htm| archivedate= 29 June 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c35COXObeo8 |title=CIA &amp; Angolan Revolution 1975 Part 1 |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Soviet Union]] and [[Cuba]] supported the MPLA.

In the beginning of the Civil War, most of the half million Portuguese that lived in Angola and accounted for the majority of the skilled work in the public administration, agriculture, industries and trade fled the country leaving its once prosperous and growing economy to a state of bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/12079340?story_id=12079340 |title= The Economist: Flight from Angola | date=16 August 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During most of this period, 1975–1990, the MPLA organised and maintained a socialist regime.&lt;ref&gt;M.R. Bhagavan, ''Angola's Political Economy 1975–1985'', Uppsala: Nordiska Afrikainstitutet, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ceasefire with UNITA ===
[[Image:Cabinda, R. Congo, D.R. Congo, Angola.png|right|thumb|150px|{{legend|#ff0000|[[Cabinda]]}}{{legend|#00ff00|Republic of the Congo}}{{legend|#0000ff|Democratic Republic of the Congo}}{{legend|#ff00ff|The rest of Angola}}]]
{{Main|2000s in Angola}}
On 22 March 2002, [[Jonas Savimbi]], the leader of UNITA, was killed in combat with government troops. A cease-fire was reached by the two factions shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ao.html|title= Introduction:Angola|date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNITA gave up its armed wing and assumed the role of major opposition party, although in the knowledge that in the present regime a legitimate democratic election was impossible. Although the political situation of the country began to stabilize, regular democratic processes were not established before the [[Elections in Angola]] in 2008 and 2012 and the adoption of a new [[Constitution of Angola]] in 2010, all of which strengthened the prevailing [[Dominant-party system]]. MPLA head officials continue e.g. to be given senior positions in top level companies or other fields, although a few outstanding UNITA figures are given some shares in the economic as well as in the military share.&lt;ref&gt;In 2006 a former UNITA general, Nduma, was appointed head of the general staff of the armed forces.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Angola's major problems are a serious humanitarian crisis (a result of the prolonged war), the abundance of [[minefield]]s, the continuation of the political, and to a much lesser degree, military activities in favour of the independence of the northern [[exclave]] of [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]], carried out in the context of the protracted [[Cabinda Conflict]] by the [[Frente para a Libertação do Enclave de Cabinda]], but most of all, the dilapidation of the country's rich mineral resources by the regime. While most of the internally displaced have now settled around the capital, in the so-called &quot;Musseques&quot;, the general situation for Angolans remains desperate.&lt;ref&gt;Lari (2004), Human Rights Watch (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is comparable in size to [[Mali]] and is nearly twice the size of the US state of Texas, or five times the area of the United Kingdom. It lies mostly between latitudes [[4th parallel south|4°]] and [[18th parallel south|18°S]], and longitudes [[12th meridian east|12°]] and [[24th meridian east|24°E]].

Angola is bordered by [[Namibia]] to the south, [[Zambia]] to the east, the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] to the north-east, and the [[South Atlantic Ocean]] to the west. The [[exclave]] of [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]] also borders the [[Republic of the Congo]] to the north. Angola's capital, [[Luanda]], lies on the Atlantic coast in the northwest of the country.

Angola has four principal natural regions: the arid coastal lowland, stretching from Namibia to [[Luanda]] and characterized by low plains and terraces; green hills and mountains, rising inland from the coast into a great escarpment; a large area of high inland plains of dry [[savanna]], called the high plateau (planalto), which extends eastward and south-east from the escarpment; and [[rain forest]] in the north and in [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]]. The highest point in Angola is [[Morro de Môco]], at 2,620 m. Elevations generally range from {{convert|3000|to|6000|ft|m}}.

===Coastal lowland===
The coast is for the most part flat, with occasional low cliffs and bluffs of red [[sandstone]]. There is but one deep inlet of the sea – Great Fish Bay (or Baía dos Tigres). Farther north are Port Alexander, Little Fish Bay and Lobito Bay, while shallower bays are numerous. Lobito Bay has water sufficient to allow large ships to unload close inshore.  
The coastal lowland rises from the sea in a series of low terraces. This region varies in width from about 25 kilometers near Benguela to more than 150 kilometers in the Cuanza River Valley just south of Angola's capital, Luanda, and is markedly different from Angola's highland mass. The Atlantic Ocean's cold, northwardflowing Benguela Current substantially reduces precipitation along the coast, making the region relatively arid or nearly so south of Benguela (where it forms the northern extension of the Namib Desert), and quite dry even in its northern reaches. Even where, as around Luanda, the average annual rainfall may be as much as fifty centimeters, it is not common for the rains to fail. Given this pattern of precipitation, the far south is marked by sand dunes, which give way to dry scrub along the middle coast. Portions of the northern coastal plain are covered by thick brush. 

===Hills and mountains===

The approach to the great central plateau of Africa is marked by the west-central highlands, a series of irregular [[escarpment]]s and [[cuesta]]s parallel to the coast at distances ranging from 20 kilometers to 100 kilometers inland as Tala Mugongo ({{convert|4400|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}), Chella and Vissecua ({{convert|5250|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}). 
The Cuanza River divides the mountain zone into two parts. The northern part rises gradually from the coastal zone to an average elevation of 500 meters, with crests as high as 1,000 to 1,800 meters. South of the Cuanza River, the hills rise sharply from the coastal lowlands and form a high escarpment, extending from a point east of Luanda and running south through Namibia. The highest peak is Mount Moco ({{convert|2620|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}), and the escarpment is steepest in the far south in the Serra da Chella mountain range. In Benguela Province other high points are Loviti ({{convert|7780|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}), in 12° 5' S., and Mt. Elonga ({{convert|7550|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}). South of the Cuanza is the volcanic mountain [[Caculo-Cabaza]] ({{convert|3300|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}).

===High plateau===
The high plateau, with an altitude ranging from {{convert|4000|to|6000|ft}}, lies to the east of the hills and mountains and dominates Angola's terrain. It consists of well-watered, wide, rolling plains, and low hills with scanty vegetation. The surface of the plateau is typically flat or rolling, but parts of the Benguela Plateau and the Humpata Highland area of the Huíla Plateau in the south reach heights of 2,500 meters and more. The Malanje Plateau to the north rarely exceeds 1,000 meters in height. The Benguela Plateau and the coastal area in the immediate environs of Benguela and Lobito, the [[Bié Plateau]], the Malanje Plateau, and a small section of the Huíla Plateau near the town of Lubango have long been among the most densely settled areas in Angola. In the east the tableland falls away to the basins of the Congo and Zambezi, to the south in Namibia it merges into a barren sandy [[desert]].

== Climate ==
{{Main|Climate of Angola}}
[[File:Marginal Avenida 4 de Fevreiro Luanda March 2013 02.JPG|thumb|Promenade on Luanda Bay]]
Angola's average temperature on the coast is {{convert|60|F|C}} in the winter and {{convert|70|F|C}} in the summer. It has two seasons; dry season (May to October) and hot rainy season (November to April).

Like the rest of tropical Africa, Angola experiences distinct, alternating [[Monsoon|rainy]] and [[Dry season|dry]] seasons. The coastal strip is tempered by the cool [[Benguela Current]], resulting in a climate similar to coastal [[Peru]] or [[Baja California]]. It is [[Semi-arid climate|semiarid]] in the South and along the coast to Luanda. There is a short rainy season lasting from February to April. Summers are hot and dry, while winters are mild. The north has a cool, dry season.  The climate is greatly influenced by the [[prevailing wind]]s, which arc W., S.W. and S.S.W.  Two seasons are distinguished – the cool, from June to September; and the rainy, from October to May.  The heaviest rainfall occurs in April, and is accompanied by violent storms. 
The far north and Cabinda enjoy rain throughout much of the year.


== Politics ==
{{Main|Politics of Angola}}
{{See also|List of political parties in Angola||Foreign relations of Angola|List of diplomatic missions of Angola}}
[[File:Vladimir Putin with Jose Eduardo dos Santos-1.jpg|thumb|[[José Eduardo dos Santos]] meets with [[Vladimir Putin]]]]
Angola's motto is ''Virtus Unita Fortior'', a [[Latin]] phrase meaning &quot;Virtue is stronger when united&quot;. The executive branch of the government is composed of the President, the Vice-Presidents and the Council of Ministers. For decades, political power has been concentrated in the Presidency.

Governors of the 18 provinces are appointed by the president. The Constitutional Law of 1992 establishes the broad outlines of government structure and delineates the rights and duties of citizens. The legal system is based on Portuguese and customary law but is weak and fragmented, and courts operate in only 12 of more than 140 municipalities. A Supreme Court serves as the appellate tribunal; a Constitutional Court with powers of judicial review has not been constituted until 2010, despite statutory authorization.

After the end of the Civil War the regime came under pressure from within as well as from the international environment, to become more democratic and less authoritarian. Its reaction was to operate a number of changes without substantially changing its character.&lt;ref&gt;See Didier Péclard (ed.), ''L'Angola dans la paix: Autoritarisme et reconversions'', special issue of ''Politique africains'' (Paris), 110, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Angola is classified as 'not free' by [[Freedom House]] in the [[Freedom in the World]] 2013 report.&lt;ref name=freedomhouse&gt;{{cite web|title=Angola|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2013/angola|work=Freedom in the World 2013|publisher=Freedom House|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report noted that the [[Angolan legislative election, 2012|August 2012 parliamentary elections]], in which the ruling [[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]] won more than 70% of the vote, suffered from serious flaws, including outdated and inaccurate voter rolls.&lt;ref name=freedomhouse/&gt; Voter turnout dropped from 80% in 2008 to 60%.&lt;ref name=freedomhouse/&gt;

Angola scored poorly on the 2008 [[Ibrahim Index of African Governance]]. It was ranked 44 from 48 [[sub-Saharan Africa]]n countries, scoring particularly badly in the areas of Participation and Human Rights, Sustainable Economic Opportunity and Human Development. The Ibrahim Index uses a number of different variables to compile its list which reflects the state of governance in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moibrahimfoundation.org/ |title=Mo Ibrahim Foundation |publisher=Mo Ibrahim Foundation |accessdate=27 June 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100722010615/http://www.moibrahimfoundation.org/| archivedate= 22 July 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new [[Constitution of Angola|constitution]], adopted in 2010, further sharpened the authoritarian character of the regime. In the future, there will be no presidential elections: the president and the vice-president of the political party which comes out strongest in the parliamentary elections become automatically president and vice-president of Angola.&lt;ref&gt;In this manner, [[José Eduardo dos Santos]] is now finally in a legal situation. As he had obtained a relative, but not the absolute majority of votes in the 1992 presidential election, a second round—opposing him to [[Jonas Savimbi]]—was constitutionally necessary to make his election effective, but he preferred never to hold this second round.&lt;/ref&gt; Through a variety of mechanisms, the state president controls all the other organs of the state, so that the principle of the division of power is not maintained. As a consequence, Angola has no longer a presidential system, in the sense of the systems existing e.g. in the [[Federal government of the United States|USA]] or in [[French government|France]]. In terms of the classifications used in constitutional law, its regime is considered one of several authoritarian regimes in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;See Jorge Miranda, ''A Constituição de Angola de 2010'', published in the academic journal ''O Direito'' (Lisbon), vol. 142, 2010 – 1 (June).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military ===
[[File:Angolan Air Force Ilyushin Il-76TD Karpezo-1.jpg|thumb|Angolan Air Force Ilyushin Il-76TD Karpezo-1]]
{{Main|Angolan Armed Forces}}
The Angolan Armed Forces (AAF) is headed by a Chief of Staff who reports to the Minister of Defense. There are three divisions—the Army (Exército), Navy (Marinha de Guerra, MGA), and [[National Air Force of Angola|National Air Force]] (Força Aérea Nacional, FAN). Total manpower is about 110,000.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Its equipment includes Russian-manufactured fighters, bombers, and transport planes. There are also Brazilian-made EMB-312 Tucano for training role, Czech-made L-39 for training and bombing role, Czech Zlin for training role and a variety of western made aircraft such as C-212\Aviocar, Sud Aviation Alouette III, etc. A small number of AAF personnel are stationed in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (Kinshasa) and the [[Republic of the Congo]] (Brazzaville).

=== Police ===
The National Police departments are Public Order, Criminal Investigation, Traffic and Transport, Investigation and Inspection of Economic Activities, Taxation and Frontier Supervision, Riot Police and the Rapid Intervention Police. The National Police are in the process of standing up an air wing, which will provide helicopter support for operations. The National Police are developing their criminal investigation and forensic capabilities. The force has an estimated 6,000 patrol officers, 2,500 taxation and frontier supervision officers, 182 criminal investigators and 100 financial crimes detectives and around 90 economic activity inspectors.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The National Police have implemented a modernization and development plan to increase the capabilities and efficiency of the total force. In addition to administrative reorganization, modernization projects include procurement of new vehicles, aircraft and equipment, construction of new police stations and forensic laboratories, restructured training programs and the replacement of [[AKM rifle]]s with 9&amp;nbsp;mm [[Uzi]]s for officers in urban areas.

=== Exclave of Cabinda ===

[[File:Flag of Cabinda.svg|thumb|200px|Flag of the [[Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda|Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC)]]]]
With an area of approximately {{convert|7283|km2|sqmi}}, the Northern Angolan province of Cabinda is unique in being separated from the rest of the country by a strip, some {{convert|60|km}} wide, of the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] along the lower [[Congo river]]. Cabinda borders the [[Congo Republic]] to the north and north-northeast and the DRC to the east and south. The town of Cabinda is the chief population center.

According to a 1995 census, Cabinda had an estimated population of 600,000, approximately 400,000 of whom live in neighboring countries. Population estimates are, however, highly unreliable. Consisting largely of tropical forest, Cabinda produces hardwoods, coffee, cocoa, crude rubber and palm oil. The product for which it is best known, however, is its oil, which has given it the nickname, &quot;the Kuwait of Africa&quot;. Cabinda's petroleum production from its considerable offshore reserves now accounts for more than half of Angola's output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angola profile|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13036732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the oil along its coast was discovered under [[Portuguese Africa|Portuguese rule]] by the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company (CABGOC) from 1968 onwards.

Ever since [[Portugal]] handed over sovereignty of its former overseas province of Angola to the local independence groups (MPLA, UNITA, and FNLA), the territory of Cabinda has been a focus of separatist guerrilla actions opposing the [[Government of Angola]] (which has employed its military forces, the FAA—Forças Armadas Angolanas) and Cabindan separatists. The [[Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda]]-[[Forças Armadas de Cabinda|Armed Forces of Cabinda]] (FLEC-FAC) announced a virtual Federal Republic of Cabinda under the Presidency of N'Zita Henriques Tiago. One of the characteristics of the Cabindan independence movement is its constant fragmentation, into smaller and smaller factions.

Angola's financial system is maintained by the [[National Bank of Angola]] and managed by Governor [[:no:Jose de Lima Massano|Jose de Lima Massano]]. 
Angola has a rich subsoil heritage, from diamonds, oil, gold, copper, and a rich wildlife (dramatically impoverished during the civil war), forest, and fossils. Since independence, oil and diamonds have been the most important economic resource. Smallholder and plantation agriculture have dramatically dropped because of the [[Angolan Civil War]], but have begun to recover after 2002. The transformation industry that had come into existence in the late colonial period collapsed at independence, because of the exodus of most of the ethnic Portuguese population, but has begun to reemerge (with updated technologies), partly because of the influx of new Portuguese entrepreneurs. Similar developments can be verified in the service sector.

Overall, Angola's economy has undergone a period of transformation in recent years, moving from the disarray caused by a quarter century of civil war to being the fastest growing economy in Africa and one of the fastest in the world, with an average GDP growth of 20 percent between 2005 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfw4a.org/angola/angola-financial-sector-profile.html Angola Financial Sector Profile: MFW4A – Making Finance Work for Africa]. MFW4A. Retrieved on 9 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In the period 2001–2010, Angola had the world's highest [[annual average GDP growth]], at 11.1 percent. In 2004, China's [[Eximbank]] approved a $2&amp;nbsp;billion line of credit to Angola. The loan is being used to rebuild Angola's infrastructure, and has also limited the influence of the [[International Monetary Fund]] in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pinr.com/report.php?ac=view_report&amp;report_id=460&amp;language_id=1 |title=The Increasing Importance of African Oil |work=Power and Interest Report |date=20 March 2006}}{{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; China is Angola's biggest trade partner and export destination as well as the fourth-largest importer. Bilateral trade reached $27.67 billion in 2011, up 11.5 percent year-on-year. China's imports, mainly crude oil and diamonds, increased 9.1 percent to $24.89 billion while China's exports, including mechanical and electrical products, machinery parts and construction materials, surged 38.8 percent.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The overabundance of oil led to a local unleaded gasoline &quot;pricetag&quot; of [[Pound sterling|£]]0.37 per gallon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/8632811/Luanda-capital-of-Angola-retains-title-of-worlds-most-expensive-for-expats.html Luanda, capital of Angola, retains title of world's most expensive for expats].

''The Economist'' reported in 2008 that diamonds and oil make up 60 percent of Angola's economy, almost all of the country's revenue and are its dominant exports.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Economist]]. 30 August 2008 edition.

Control of the [[Petroleum industry|oil industry]] is consolidated in [[Sonangol Group]], a conglomerate which is owned by the Angolan government. In December 2006, Angola was admitted as a member of [[OPEC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Angola: Country Admitted As Opec Member |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200612140990.html |date=14 December 2006 |publisher=Angola Press Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, operations in [[List of diamond mines|diamond mines]] include partnerships between state-run [[Endiama]] and mining companies such as [[ALROSA]] which continue operations in Angola.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.angolancentenary.com/press6.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The economy grew 18% in 2005, 26% in 2006 and 17.6% in 2007. However, due to the global recession the economy contracted an estimated −0.3% in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ao.html retrieved 24 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The security brought about by the 2002 peace settlement has led to the resettlement of 4&amp;nbsp;million displaced persons, thus resulting in large-scale increases in agriculture production.

Although the country's economy has developed significantly since achieving political stability in 2002, mainly thanks to the fast-rising earnings of the oil sector, Angola faces huge social and economic problems. These are in part a result of the almost continual state of conflict from 1961 onwards, although the highest level of destruction and socio-economic damage took place after the 1975 independence, during the long years of [[Angolan civil war|civil war]]. However, high poverty rates and blatant social inequality are chiefly the outcome of a combination of a persistent political authoritarianism, of &quot;neo-patrimonial&quot; practices at all levels of the political, administrative, military, and economic apparatuses, and of [[Corruption in Angola|a pervasive corruption]].&lt;ref&gt;Anti-corruption watchdog [[Transparency International]] rates Angola one of the 10 most corrupt countries in the world.&lt;/ref&gt; The main beneficiary of this situation is a social segment constituted since 1975, but mainly during the last decades, around the political, administrative, economic, and military power holders, which has accumulated (and continues accumulating) enormous wealth.&lt;ref&gt;This process is well analyzed by authors like Christine Messiant, Tony Hodges and others. For an eloquent illustrating, see now the Angolan magazine ''Infra-Estruturas África'' 7/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Secondary beneficiaries&quot; are the middle strata which are about to become social classes. However, overall almost half the population has to be considered as poor, but in this respect there are dramatic differences between the countryside and the cities (where by now slightly more than 50% of the people live).

An inquiry carried out in 2008 by the Angolan Instituto Nacional de Estatística has it that in the rural areas roughly 58% must be classified as &quot;poor&quot;, according to UN norms, but in the urban areas only 19%, while the overall rate is 37%.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Angola Exame'' of 12/11/2010, online http://www.exameangola.com/pt/?det=16943&amp;id=2000&amp;mid=.&lt;/ref&gt; In the cities, a majority of families, well beyond those officially classified as poor, have to adopt a variety of survival strategies.&lt;ref&gt;See Cristina Udelsmann Rodrigues, ''O Trabalho Dignifica o Homem: Estratégias de Sobrevivência em Luanda'', Lisbon: Colibri: 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, in urban areas social inequality is most evident, and assumes extreme forms in the capital, Luanda.&lt;ref&gt;As an excellent illustration see ''Luanda: A vida na cidade dos extremos'', in: ''Visão'', 11 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Human Development Index]] Angola constantly ranks in the bottom group.&lt;ref&gt;The HDI 2010 lists Angola in the 146th position among 169 countries—one position below that of Haiti. See [http://www.undp.org/publications/hdr2010/en/HDR_2010_EN_Table1.pdf ''Human Development Index and its components.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[The Heritage Foundation]], a conservative American [[think tank]], oil production from Angola has increased so significantly that Angola now is China's biggest supplier of oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alt |first=Robert |url=http://www.heritage.org/research/africa/HL1006.CFM |title=Into Africa: China's Grab for Influence and Oil |publisher=Heritage.org |accessdate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growing oil revenues have also created opportunities for [[Corruption in Angola|corruption]]: according to a recent [[Human Rights Watch]] report, 32 billion US dollars disappeared from government accounts from 2007 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=22 December 2011 |url=http://www.hrw.org/news/2011/12/20/angola-explain-missing-government-funds |title=Angola: Explain Missing Government Funds |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before independence in 1975, [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] was a breadbasket of southern Africa and a major exporter of [[bananas]], coffee and [[sisal]], but [[Angolan Civil War|three decades of civil war]] (1975–2002) destroyed the fertile countryside, leaving it littered with landmines and driving millions into the cities. The country now depends on expensive food imports, mainly from South Africa and [[Portugal]], while more than 90 percent of farming is done at family and subsistence level. Thousands of Angolan small-scale farmers are trapped in poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Redvers, [http://ipsnews.net/africa/nota.asp?idnews=47123 POVERTY-ANGOLA: Inter Press Service News Agency – NGOs Sceptical of Govt's Rural Development Plans] retrieved 6 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The enormous differences between the regions pose a serious structural problem in the Angolan economy. This is best illustrated by the fact that about one third of the economic activities is concentrated in Luanda and the neighbouring Bengo province, while several areas of the interior are characterized by stagnation and even regression.&lt;ref&gt;See Manuel Alves da Rocha, ''Desigualdades e assimetrias regionais em Angola: Os factores da competitividade territorial'', Luanda: Centro de Estudos e Investigação Científica da Universidade Católica de Angola, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the economic consequences of the social and regional disparities is a sharp increase in Angolan private investments abroad. The small fringe of Angolan society where most of the accumulation takes place seeks to spread its assets, for reasons of security and profit. For the time being, the biggest share of these investments is concentrated in Portugal where the [[Angolans in Portugal|Angolan presence]] (including that of the family of the state president) in banks as well as in the domains of energy, [[Telecommunications in Angola|telecommunications]], and mass media has become notable, as has the acquisition of vineyards and orchards as well as of touristic enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;See &quot;A força do kwanza&quot;, ''Visão'' (Lisbon), 993, 15 May 2012, pp. 50–54&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
{{Main|Transport in Angola}}
[[File:Aeroport-4-de-Fevereiro-Chegadas LWS1962.JPG|thumb|[[Luanda Airport|Quatro de Fevereiro Luanda Airport]] arrivals]]
Transport in Angola consists of:
* Three separate [[Rail transport in Angola|railway systems]] totalling 2,761&amp;nbsp;km (1,715&amp;nbsp;mi)
* {{convert|76626|km|0|abbr=on}} of highway of which {{convert|19156|km|0|abbr=on}} is paved
* 1,295 navigable inland waterways
* Eight major [[sea port]]s
* 243 [[List of airports in Angola|airports]], of which 32 are paved.

Travel on highways outside of towns and cities in Angola (and in some cases within) is often not best advised for those without four-by-four vehicles. While a reasonable road infrastructure has existed within Angola, time and the war have taken their toll on the road surfaces, leaving many severely potholed, littered with broken asphalt. In many areas drivers have established alternate tracks to avoid the worst parts of the surface, although careful attention must be paid to the presence or absence of landmine warning markers by the side of the road. The Angolan government has contracted the restoration of many of the country's roads. The road between Lubango and Namibe, for example, was completed recently with funding from the European Union, and is comparable to many European main routes. Progress to complete the road infrastructure is likely to take some decades, but substantial efforts are already being made in the right directions.

=== Languages ===
{{Main|Languages of Angola}}
[[File:CPLP map-pt.svg|thumb|350px|Angola is a member of [[CPLP]] – Community of Portuguese speaking nations]]
The languages in Angola are those originally spoken by the different ethnic groups and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], introduced during the Portuguese colonial era. The indigenous languages with the largest usage are [[Umbundu]], [[Kimbundu]], and [[Kikongo]], in that order. Portuguese is the official language of the country.

Mastery of the official language is probably more extended in Angola than it is elsewhere in Africa, and this certainly applies to its use in everyday life. Moreover, and above all, the proportion of native (or near native) speakers of the language of the former colonizer, turned official after independence, is no doubt considerably higher than in any other African country.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

There are three intertwined historical reasons for this situation.
#In the Portuguese &quot;bridgeheads&quot; [[Luanda]] and [[Benguela]], which existed on the coast of what today is Angola since the 15th and 16th century, respectively, Portuguese was spoken not only by the Portuguese and their ''mestiço'' descendents, but—especially in and around Luanda—by a significant number of Africans, although these always remained native speakers of their local African language.
#Since the Portuguese conquest of the present territory of Angola, and especially since its &quot;effective occupation&quot; in the mid-1920s, schooling in Portuguese was slowly developed by the colonial state as well as by Catholic and Protestant missions. The rhythm of this expansion was considerably accelerated during the late colonial period, 1961–1974, so that by the end of the colonial period children all over the territory (with relatively few exceptions) had at least some access to the Portuguese language.&lt;ref&gt;An illustration is Franz-Wilhelm Heimer, '’Educação e sociedade nas áreas rurais de Angola: Resultados de um inquérito’’, vol. 2, ‘’Análise do universo agrícola’’ (survey report), Serviços de Planeamento e Integração Económica de Angola, Luanda, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;
#In the same late colonial period, the legal discrimination of the black population was abolished, and the state apparatus in fields like health, education, social work, and rural development was enlarged. This entailed a significant increase in jobs for Africans, under the condition that they spoke Portuguese.

As a consequence of all this, the African “lower middle class” which at that stage formed in Luanda and other cities began to often prevent their children from learning the local African language, in order to guarantee that they learned Portuguese as their native language. At the same time, the white and “mestiço” population, where some knowledge of African languages could previously often been found, neglected this aspect more and more, to the point of frequently ignoring it totally.
After independence, these tendencies continued, and were even strengthened, under the rule of the MPLA which has its main social roots exactly in those social segments where the mastery of Portuguese as well as the proportion of native Portuguese speakers was highest. This became a political side issue, as FNLA and UNITA, given their regional constituencies, came out in favour of a greater attention to the African languages, and as the FNLA favoured French over Portuguese.

The dynamics of the language situation, as described above, were additionally fostered by the massive migrations triggered by the Civil War. [[Ovimbundu]], the most populous ethnic group and the most affected by the war, appeared in great numbers in urban areas outside their areas, especially in Luanda and surroundings. At the same time, a majority of the [[Bakongo]] who had fled to the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] in the early 1960s, or of their children and grandchildren, returned to Angola, but mostly did not settle in their original &quot;habitat&quot;, but in the cities—and again above all in Luanda. As a consequence, more than half the population is now living in the cities which, from the linguistic point of view, have become highly heterogeneous. This means, of course, that Portuguese as the overall language of communication is by now of paramount importance, and that the role of the African languages is steadily decreasing among the urban population—a trend which is beginning to spread into rural areas as well.

The exact numbers of those fluent in Portuguese or who speak Portuguese as a first language are unknown, although a census is expected to be carried out in July–August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paris21.org/node/1176|title=Angola: Population Census Dates Set|publisher=[[PARIS21]]|quote=Angola has set dates for their population census: from 16 July to 18 August 2013|date=19 April 2011|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2013|07|16|reason=According to the source, the census will have started as of 16 July 2013.}} Quite a number of voices demand the recognition of &quot;Angolan Portuguese&quot; as a specific variant, comparable to those spoken in Portugal or in Brazil. However, while there exists a certain number of idiomatic particularities in everyday Portuguese, as spoken by Angolans, it remains to be seen whether or not the Angolan government comes to the conclusion that these particularities constitute a configuration that justifies the claim to be a new language variant.

[[File:Angola Ethnic map 1970.svg|thumb|Ethnic groups of Angola 1970 (With areas where the so-called  &quot;Ganguela&quot; groups are dominant, marked green)]]
There are about 1000 mostly Christian religious communities in Angola.&lt;ref&gt;See Fátima Viegas, ''Panorama das Religiões em Angola Independente (1975–2008)'', Ministério da Cultura/Instituto Nacional para os Assuntos Religiosos, Luanda 2008&lt;/ref&gt; While reliable statistics are nonexistent, estimates have it that more than half of the population are Catholics, while about a quarter adhere to the Protestant churches introduced during the colonial period: the [[Congregationalist]]s mainly among the [[Ovimbundu]] of the Central Highlands and the coastal region to its West, the [[Methodists]] concentrating on the [[Kimbundu]] speaking strip from Luanda to Malanje, the [[Baptists]] almost exclusively among the [[Bakongo]] of the Northwest (now massively present in Luanda as well) and dispersed [[Adventists]], [[Reformed]] and [[Lutherans]].&lt;ref&gt;Benedict Schubert: ''Der Krieg und die Kirchen: Angola 1961–1991''. Exodus, Luzern/Switzerland, 1997; Lawrence W. Henderson, ''The Church in Angola: A river of many currents'', Cleveland: Pilgrim Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; In Luanda and region there subsists a nucleus of the &quot;[[syncretic]]&quot; [[Tocoists]] and in the northwest a sprinkling of [[Kimbanguism]] can be found, spreading from the Congo/Zaire. Since independence, hundreds of [[Pentecostal]] and similar communities have sprung up in the cities, where by now about 50% of the population is living; several of these communities/churches are of Brazilian origin.

The U.S. Department of State estimates the Muslim population at 80,000–90,000,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2008/108352.htm&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Islamic Community of Angola]] puts the figure closer to 500,000.&lt;ref&gt;''O Pais, ''[http://www.opais.net/pt/opais/?id=1657&amp;det=23057 Surgimento do Islão em Angola], 2 September 2011, Pg 18&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims consist largely of migrants from West Africa and the Middle East (especially [[Lebanon]]), although some are local converts.&lt;ref name=&quot;customs&quot;&gt;Oyebade, Adebayo O.

Foreign [[missionary|missionaries]] were very active prior to independence in 1975, although since the beginning of the anti-colonial fight in 1961 the Portuguese colonial authorities expelled a series of Protestant missionaries and closed mission stations based on the belief that the missionaries were inciting pro-independence sentiments. Missionaries have been able to return to the country since the early 1990s, although security conditions due to the civil war have prevented them until 2002 from restoring many of their former inland mission stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2001/5511.htm |title=U.S. Department of State |publisher=State.gov |date=1 January 2004 |accessdate=27 June 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100528135031/http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2001/5511.htm| archivedate= 28 May 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence, both countries share cultural aspects: language ([[Portuguese Language|Portuguese]]) and main religion (Roman Catholic Christianity). The ''[[Substratum|substrate]]'' of Angolan culture is African, mostly [[Bantu people|Bantu]], while [[culture of Portugal|Portuguese culture]] has been imported. The diverse ethnic communities  – the [[Ovimbundu]], [[Northern Mbundu people|Ambundu]], [[Bakongo]], [[Chokwe language|Chokwe]], [[Mbunda]] and other peoples – maintain to varying degrees their own cultural traits, traditions and languages, but in the cities, where slightly more than half of the population now lives, a mixed culture has been emerging since colonial times – in [[Luanda]] since its foundation in the 16th century. In this urban culture, the Portuguese heritage has become more and more dominant. An African influence is evident in music and dance, and is moulding the way in which Portuguese is spoken, but is almost disappearing from the vocabulary. This process is well reflected in contemporary Angolan literature, especially in the works of [[Pepetela]] and [[Ana Paula Ribeiro Tavares]].

Angola is the top basketball team of [[FIBA Africa]], and a regular competitor at the [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Summer Olympic Games]] and the [[FIBA World Cup]]. The [[Angola national football team]] qualified for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, as this was their first appearance on the World Cup finals stage. They were eliminated after one defeat and two draws in the group stage. They won 3 [[COSAFA Cup]] and finished runner up in [[2011 African Nations Championship]]. Angola has participated in the [[World Women's Handball Championship]] for several years.

This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Angola]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

[[Image:Angola demography.png|thumb|300px|right|Demographics of [[Angola]], Data of [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], year 2005 ; Number of inhabitants in thousands.]]
Ethnically, three main groups have to be distinguished, each speaking a [[Bantu language]]: the [[Southern Mbundu people|Ovimbundu]] who represent 37% of the population, the [[Northern Mbundu people|(Ambundu)]] with 25%, and the [[Kongo people|Bakongo]] 13%. Other numerically important groups include the closely interrelated [[Chokwe people|Chokwe]] and Lunda, the [[Ganguela]] and [[Nhaneca-Humbe]], in both cases classification terms which stand for a variety of small groups, the [[Ovambo people|Ovambo]], the [[Herero people|Herero]],  the [[Xindonga]] and scattered residual groups of [[Khoisan]]. In addition, mixed race (European and African) people amount to about 2%, with a small (1%) population of whites, mainly ethnically [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]]. As a [[Angola (Portugal)|former overseas territory of Portugal]] until 1975, Angola possesses a Portuguese population of over 200,000, a number that has been growing from 2000 onwards, because of Angola's growing demand for qualified human resources.&lt;ref&gt;It should be recalled that in 1974, white Angolans made up a population of 330 thousand to 350 thousand people in an overall population of 6,3 million Angolans at that time. The only reliable source on these numbers is Gerald Bender &amp; Stanley Yoder, ''Whites in Angola on the Eve of Independence: The Politics of Numbers'', ''Africa Today'', 21 (4) 1974, pp. 23 - 37. Today, many Angolans who are not ethnic Portuguese can claim Portuguese nationality under Portuguese law. Estimates on the overall population are given in [http://www.opais.net/pt/opais/?det=7192 O País]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/12079340?story_id=12079340 www.economist.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/angola/34.htm Country Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://jn.sapo.pt/PaginaInicial/Sociedade/Interior.aspx?content_id=1165354 Portugueses em Angola quadruplicaram], [[Jornal de Notícias]] (March 10, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the Portuguese, significant numbers of people from other European and from diverse Latin American countries (especially Brazil) can be found. From the 2000s many Chinese have settled and started up small businesses, while at least as many have come as workforce for large (construction or other) enterprises. Observers claim that the Chinese community in Angola might include as many as 300,000 persons at the end of 2010, but nothing near to reliable statistics are at this stage available on this point.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/9052011.stm Chinese karaoke fans sing Angola's praises]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974/75, over 25,000 [[Cuba]]n soldiers arrived in Angola to help the MPLA forces during the decolonisation conflict. Once this was over, a massive development cooperation in the field of health and education brought in numerous civil personnel from Cuba. However, only a very small percentage of all these people has remained in Angola, either for personal reasons (intermarriage) or as professionals (e.g. medical doctors).

The largest religious denomination  is [[Roman Catholicism]], to which adheres about half the population. Roughly 26% are followers of traditional forms of [[Protestantism]] (Congregationals, Methodists, Baptista, Lutherans, Reformed), but over the last decades there has in addition been a growth of Pentecostal communities and [[African Initiated Church]]es. In 2006, one out of 221 people were [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. Blacks from Mali, Nigeria and Senegal are mostly Sunnite Muslims, but do not make up more than 1 - 2% of the population. By now few Angolans retain [[African traditional religion]]s following different ethnic faiths.

==Population==
According to the 2010 revison of the World Population Prospects the total population was 19 082 000 in 2010, compared to only 4 148 000 in 1950. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 46.6%, 50.9% was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 2.5% was 65 years or older

The following demographic statistics are from the [[CIA World Factbook]], unless otherwise indicated.&lt;ref&gt;It should be underlined that many of these statistics are not fully reliable and/or outdated. Updated and reliable data are expected from the population census scheduled for 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population===
*18,056,072 (July 2012 est.)

====Population growth====
The population is growing by 2.184% annually. There are 44.51 births and 24.81 deaths per 1,000 citizens. The net migration rate is 2.14 migrants per 1,000 citizens. The fertility rate of Angola is 5.97 children born per woman as of 2011. The [[infant mortality]] rate is 184.44 deaths for every 1,000 live births with 196.55 deaths for males and 171.72 deaths for females for every 1,000 live births. Life expectancy at birth is 37.63 years; 36.73 years for males and 38.57 years for females.

*15–64 years: 1.03 male(s)/female
*65 years and older: .79 male(s)/female
*Total population: 1.02 male(s)/female (2011 est.)

===Health===
{{See also|HIV/AIDS in Angola}}
According to the CIA World Factbook, 2% of adults (aged 15–49) are living with HIV/AIDS (as of 2009).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2155rank.html&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of contracting disease is very high. There are food and waterborne diseases, bacterial and protozoal diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever; vectorborne diseases, malaria, African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness); respiratory disease: meningococcal meningitis, and schistosomiasis, a water contact disease, as of 2005.

===Religions===
{{Main|Religion in Angola}}
Angola is a majority Christian country. Reliable statistics don't exist, but well over 80% belong in principle to a Christian church or community, although many of them don't practice their religion and are in fact non believers. More than half of the Christians (whether practising or not) are [[Roman Catholic]], the remaining ones comprising members of traditional [[Protestant]] churches as well as of new, often [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] communities. Only 1 - 2% are [[Muslim]]s  - generally immmigrants from other African countries. Traditional indigenous religions are practized by a very small minority, generally in peripheral rural societies; however, some traditional beliefs are held by a substantial number of Christians.

===Education===
{{Main|Education in Angola}}
Literacy is quite low, with 67.4% of the population over the age of 15 able to read and write in Portuguese. 82.9% of males and 54.2% of women are literate as of 2001.

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Angola}}
[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is the official language of Angola, but [[Bantu language|Bantu]] and other African languages are also widely spoken. In fact, [[Kikongo]], [[Kimbundu languages|Kimbundu]], [[Umbundu languages|Umbundu]], [[Chokwe language|Tuchokwe]], [[Ganguela|Nganguela]], and [[Kwanyama dialect|Ukanyama]] have the official status of &quot;national languages&quot;. The mastery of Portuguese is widespread; in the cities the overwhelming majority are either fluent in Portuguese or have at least a reasonable working knowledge of this language; an increasing minority are native Portuguese speakers and have a poor, if any, knowledge of an African language.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of Angola}}
Since the adoption of a new constitution, early in 2010, the '''politics of Angola''' takes place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of Angola]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a  [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in the President, the [[government]] and parliament.

[[Angola]] changed from a [[Single-party state|one-party]] [[Marxist]]-[[Leninist]] system ruled by the [[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]] (MPLA), in place since independence in 1975, to a multiparty democracy based on a new constitution adopted in 1992.  That same year, first parliamentary and presidential elections were held. In the former, the MPLA won an absolute majority. In the latter, President [[José Eduardo dos Santos]] won the first round election with more than 49% of the vote to [[Jonas Savimbi]]'s 40%. A runoff election would have been necessary, but never took place. The renewal of civil war immediately after the elections, which were considered as fraudulent by UNITA, and the collapse of the [[Lusaka Protocol]], created a split situation. On the one hand, the new democratic institutions worked, notably the [[National Assembly of Angola|National Assembly]], with the active participation of UNITA's and the FNLA's elected MPs  - while José Eduardo dos Santos continued to exercise his functions without democratic legitimation. An the other hand, the armed forces of the MPLA (now the official armed forces of the Angolan state) and of UNITA fought each other until the leader of UNITA, Jonas Savimbi, was killed in action, in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;From 1998 to 2002, there existed even a Government of National Unity and Reconciliation which included ministers from both FNLA and UNITA.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2002 to 2010, the system as defined by the constitution of 1992 functioned in a relatively normal way. The executive branch of the government was composed of the President, the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers. The Council of Ministers, composed of all ministers and vice ministers, met regularly to discuss policy issues. Governors of the 18 provinces were appointed by and served at the pleasure of the president. The Constitutional Law of 1992 established the broad outlines of government structure and the rights and duties of citizens. The legal system was based on Portuguese and customary law but was weak and fragmented. Courts operated in only 12 of more than 140 municipalities. A Supreme Court served as the appellate tribunal; a Constitutional Court with powers of judicial review was never constituted despite statutory authorization. In practice,  power was more and more concentrated in the hands of the President who, supported by an ever increasing staff, largely controlled parliament, government, and the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bertensmann-transformation-index.de/bti/laendergutachten/laendergutachten/oestliches-und-suedliches-afrika/angola &lt;/ref&gt;

The 26-year long civil war has ravaged the country's political and social institutions. The UN estimates of 1.8 million [[internally displaced person]]s (IDPs), while generally the accepted figure for war-affected people is 4 million. Daily conditions of life throughout the country and specifically [[Luanda]] (population approximately 4 million) mirror the collapse of administrative infrastructure as well as many social institutions. The ongoing grave economic situation largely prevents any government support for social institutions. Hospitals are without medicines or basic equipment, schools are without books, and public employees often lack the basic supplies for their day-to-day work.

The 2010 constitution grants the President almost absolute power. Elections for the National assembly are to take place every five years, and the President is automatically the leader of the winning party or coalition. It is for the President to appoint (and dismiss) all of the following:
* The members of the government (state ministers, ministers, state secretaries and vice-ministers);
* The members of the Constitutional Court;
* The members of the Supreme Court;
* The members of the Court of Auditors;
* The members of the Military Supreme Court;
* The Governor and Vice-Governors of the Nacional Angolan Bank;
* The General-Attorney, the Vice-General-Attorneys and their deputies (as well as the military homologous);
* The Governors of the provinces;
* The members of the Republic Council;
* The members of the National Security Council;
* The members of the Superior Magistrates Councils;
* The General Chief of the Armed Forces and his deputy;
* All other command posts in the military;
* The Police General Commander, and the 2nd in command;
* All other command posts in the police;
* The chiefs and directors of the intelligence and security organs.
The President is also provided a variety of powers, like defining the policy of the country. Even though it's not up to him/her to make laws (only to promulgate them and make edicts), the President is the leader of the winning party.
The only &quot;relevant&quot; post that is not directly appointed by the President is the Vice-President, which is the second in the winning party.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.angolaembassy.org.il/documents/AngolaConstitution05.02.2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Executive branch==
{{office-table}}
|}

==Legislative branch==
The [[National Assembly of Angola|National Assembly]] (''Assembleia Nacional'') has 223 members, elected for a four year term, 130 members by [[proportional representation]], 90 members in provincial districts, and 3 members to represent Angolans abroad. The next general elections, due for 1997, have been rescheduled for 5 September 2008. The ruling party MPLA won 82% (191 seats in the National Assembly) and the main opposition party won only 10% (16 seats). The elections however have been described as only partly free but certainly not fair.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kas.de/proj/home/pub/8/2/year-2008/dokument_id-15323/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; A White Book on the elections in 2008 lists up all irregularities surrounding the Parliamentary elections of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kas.de/proj/home/pub/8/2/year-2009/dokument_id-17396/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Economy of Angola''' is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world,&lt;ref name=&quot;fastest&quot;&gt;Birgitte Refslund Sørensen and Marc Vincent. ''Caught Between Borders: Response Strategies of the Internally Displaced'', 2001. Page 17.&lt;/ref&gt; with the Economist asserting that for 2001 to 2010, Angolas' Annual average GDP growth was 11.1 percent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/01/daily_chart Retrieved on January 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It is still recovering from the [[Angolan Civil War]] that plagued Angola from [[Alvor Agreement|independence in 1975]] until 2002. Despite extensive [[Crude oil|oil and gas]] resources, [[diamond]]s, hydroelectric potential, and rich agricultural land, Angola remains poor, and a third of the population relies on subsistence agriculture. Since 2002, when the 27-year civil war ended, the country has worked to repair and improve ravaged infrastructure and weakened political and social institutions. High international oil prices and rising oil production have contributed to the very strong economic growth since 1998,&lt;ref&gt;[[Google Public Data]]. Retrieved 2013-8-14.&lt;/ref&gt; but corruption and public-sector mismanagement remain, particularly in the oil sector, which accounts for over 50 percent of GDP, over 90 percent of export revenue, and over 80 percent of government revenue.

==History==
[[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]]'s explorers and settlers founded trading posts and forts along the coast of [[Africa]] beginning in the 15th century, and reached the [[Angola]]n coast in the 16th century. Portuguese explorer [[Paulo Dias de Novais]] founded [[Luanda]] in 1575 as &quot;São Paulo de Loanda&quot;, and the region developed as a [[Slavery in Angola|slave trade]] market with the help of local [[Imbangala]] and [[Northern Mbundu people|Mbundu]] peoples who were [[Slavery in Africa|notable slave hunters]]. Trade was mostly with the Portuguese [[colony of Brazil]]; Brazilian ships were the most numerous in the ports of Luanda and Benguela. By this time, Angola, a Portuguese colony, was in fact like a colony of Brazil, paradoxically another Portuguese colony. A strong Brazilian influence was also exercised by the [[Jesuits]] in religion and education. War gradually gave way to the philosophy of trade. The great trade routes and the agreements that made them possible were the driving force for activities between the different areas; warlike states become states ready to produce and to sell. In the Planalto (the high plains), the most important states were those of [[Bié Province|Bié]] and [[Bailundo]], the latter being noted for its production of foodstuffs and rubber. The colonial power, Portugal, becoming ever richer and more powerful, would not tolerate the growth of these neighbouring states and subjugated them one by one, so that by the beginning of this century the Portuguese had complete control over the entire area. During the period of the [[Iberian Union]] (1580–1640), Portugal lost influence and power and made new enemies. The [[Netherlands|Dutch]], a major enemy of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], invaded many Portuguese overseas possessions, including [[Luanda]]. The Dutch ruled Luanda from 1640 to 1648 as Fort Aardenburgh. They were seeking black slaves for use in [[sugarcane]] plantations of [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern Brazil]] ([[Pernambuco]], [[Olinda]], [[Recife]]) which they had also seized from Portugal. [[John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen]], conquered the Portuguese possessions of [[Elmina|Saint George del Mina]], Saint Thomas, and Luanda, Angola, on the west coast of Africa. After the dissolution of the Iberian Union in 1640, Portugal would reestablish its authority over the lost territories of the [[Portuguese Empire]].

The Portuguese started to develop townships, trading posts, logging camps and small processing factories. From 1764 onwards, there was a gradual change from a slave-based society to one based on production for domestic consumption and export. Meanwhile, with the [[independence of Brazil]] in 1822, the slave trade was abolished in 1836, and in 1844 Angola's ports were opened to foreign shipping. By 1850, Luanda was one of the greatest and most developed Portuguese cities in the vast [[Portuguese Empire]] outside [[Mainland Portugal]], full of trading companies, exporting (together with [[Benguela]]) palm and peanut oil, wax, copal, timber, ivory, cotton, coffee, and cocoa, among many other products. Maize, tobacco, dried meat and cassava flour also began to be produced locally. The Angolan bourgeoisie was born. From the 1920s to the 1960s, strong economic growth, abundant natural resources and development of infrastructure, led to the arrival of even more Portuguese settlers.

The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] discovered [[petroleum]] in Angola in 1955. Production began in the [[Cuanza basin]] in the 1950s, in the [[Congo basin]] in the 1960s, and in the [[exclave]] of [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]] in 1968. The [[Portuguese government]] granted operating rights for Block Zero to the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company, a subsidiary of [[ChevronTexaco]], in 1955.&lt;ref name=&quot;opec&quot;/&gt; Oil production surpassed the exportation of [[coffee]] as Angola's largest export in 1973.

A leftist military-led coup d'état, started on April 25, 1974, in Lisbon, overthrew the [[Marcelo Caetano]] government in Portugal, and promised to hand over power to an independent Angolan government. [[Mobutu Sese Seko]], the [[President of Zaire]], met with [[António de Spínola]], the transitional [[President of Portugal]], on September 15, 1974 on [[Sal island]] in [[Cape Verde]], crafting a plan to empower [[Holden Roberto]] of the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]], [[Jonas Savimbi]] of [[UNITA]], and [[Daniel Chipenda]] of the [[MPLA]]'s eastern faction at the expense of MPLA leader [[Agostinho Neto]] while retaining the façade of national unity. Mobutu and Spínola wanted to present Chipenda as the MPLA head, Mobutu particularly preferring Chipenda over Neto because Chipenda supported autonomy for [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]]. The Angolan [[exclave]] has immense petroleum reserves estimated at around 300 million tons (~300{{e|9}}&amp;nbsp;kg) which Zaire, and thus the Mobutu government, depended on for economic survival.&lt;ref name=&quot;petroleum&quot;&gt;Erik P. Hoffmann and Frederic J. Fleron. ''The Conduct of Soviet Foreign Policy'', 1980. Page 524.&lt;/ref&gt; After independence thousands of white Portuguese left, most of them to [[Portugal]] and many travelling overland to [[South Africa]]. There was an immediate crisis because the indigenous African population lacked the skills and knowledge needed to run the country and maintain its well-developed infrastructure.

The Angolan government created [[Sonangol]], a state-run oil company, in 1976. Two years later Sonangol received the rights to oil exploration and production in all of Angola.&lt;ref name=&quot;opec&quot;&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Angola/pdf.pdf Angola] Energy Information Administration&lt;/ref&gt; After independence from Portugal in 1975, Angola was ravaged by a horrific [[Angolan Civil War|civil war]] between 1975 and 2002.

===1990s===
[[United Nations Angola Verification Mission III]] and [[MONUA]] spent [[USD]]1.5 billion overseeing implementation of the [[Lusaka Protocol]], a 1994 peace accord that ultimately failed to end the civil war. The protocol prohibited UNITA from buying foreign arms, a provision the [[United Nations]] largely did not enforce, so both sides continued to build up their stockpile. UNITA purchased weapons in 1996 and 1997 from private sources in [[Albania]] and [[Bulgaria]], and from [[Zaire]], [[South Africa]], [[Republic of the Congo]], [[Zambia]], [[Togo]], and [[Burkina Faso]]. In October 1997 the UN imposed travel sanctions on UNITA leaders, but the UN waited until July 1998 to limit UNITA's exportation of diamonds and freeze UNITA bank accounts. While the U.S. government gave USD250 million to UNITA between 1986 to 1991, UNITA made USD1.72 billion between 1994 and 1999 exporting diamonds, primarily through Zaire to Europe. At the same time the Angolan government received large amounts of weapons from the governments of [[Belarus]], [[Brazil]], Bulgaria, the [[China]], and [[South Africa]]. While no arms shipment to the government violated the protocol, no country informed the U.N. Register on Conventional Weapons as required.&lt;ref name=&quot;lusaka&quot;&gt;Vines, Alex. ''Angola Unravels: The Rise and Fall of the Lusaka Peace Process'', 1999. Human Rights Watch.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the increase in civil warfare in late 1998, the economy grew by an estimated 4% in 1999. The government introduced new currency denominations in 1999, including a 1 and 5 kwanza note.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

===2000s===
An economic reform effort was launched in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Angola.]]&quot; U.S. Department of State Website. Retrieved 2013-8-14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Angola ranked 160 out of 174 nations in the [[United Nations Human Development Index]] of 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;fastest&quot;/&gt; In April 2000 Angola started an International Monetary Fund (IMF) Staff-Monitored Program (SMP). The program formally lapsed in June 2001, but the IMF remains engaged. In this context the Government of Angola has succeeded in unifying exchange rates and has raised fuel, electricity, and water rates. The Commercial Code, telecommunications law, and Foreign Investment Code are being modernized. A privatization effort, prepared with [[World Bank]] assistance, has begun with the [[Banco do Comércio e Indústria|BCI]] bank. Nevertheless, a legacy of fiscal mismanagement and corruption persists.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} The civil war [[Internally displaced person|internally displaced]] 3.8 million people, 32% of the population, by 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;fastest&quot;/&gt; The security brought about by the 2002 peace settlement has led to the resettlement of 4 million displaced persons, thus resulting in large-scale increases in agriculture production.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

The construction industry is another sector taking advantage of the growing economy, with various housing projects stimulated by the government that created various initiatives for this. Examples are the program ''Angola Investe'' and the projects ''[[Grupo Opaia SA#Casa Feliz|Casa Feliz]]'' or ''[[Grupo Opaia SA#Opaia Águas (Water)|Meña]]''. However, not all public construction projects are functional; a case in point is [[Kilamba Kiaxi]] where a whole new satellite town of Luanda, consisting in the main of housing facilities for several hundreds of thousands of people, remains practically uninhabited, because of prices that are out of reach even for the middle class.

ChevronTexaco started pumping {{convert|50|koilbbl/d|abbr=on}} from Block 14 in January 2000, but production has decreased to {{convert|57|koilbbl/d|abbr=on}} in 2007 due to the poor quality of the oil.&lt;ref name=&quot;opec&quot;/&gt; Angola joined the [[Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries]] on January 1, 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;opec&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Africa by GDP, 2002.png|right|frame|National GDP per capita ranges from wealthier states in the north and south to poorer states in the east. These figures from the 2002 World Bank are converted to US dollars.]]
Despite its abundant natural resources, output per capita is among the world's lowest. Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 85% of the population. Oil production and the supporting activities are vital to the economy, contributing about 45% to GDP and 90% of exports. Growth is almost entirely driven by rising oil production which surpassed {{convert|1.4|Moilbbl/d}} in late-2005 and which is expected to grow to {{convert|2|Moilbbl/d}} by 2007. Control of the oil industry is consolidated in [[Sonangol Group]], a conglomerate which is owned by the Angolan government. With revenues booming from oil exports, the government has started to implement ambitious development programs in building roads and other basic infrastructure for the nation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

In the last decade of the colonial period, Angola was a major African food exporter but now imports almost all its food. Because of severe wartime conditions, including extensive planting of landmines throughout the countryside, agricultural activities have been brought to a near standstill. Some efforts to recover have gone forward, however, notably in fisheries. [[Coffee]] production, though a fraction of its pre-1975 level, is sufficient for domestic needs and some exports. In sharp contrast to a bleak picture of devastation and bare subsistence is expanding oil production, now almost half of GDP and 90% of exports, at {{convert|800|koilbbl/d}}. Diamonds provided much of the revenue for [[Jonas Savimbi]]'s [[UNITA]] rebellion through illicit trade. Other rich resources await development: gold, forest products, fisheries, iron ore, coffee, and fruits.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

{{see also|Angola-United States relations}}

Exports in 2004 reached [[United States dollar|US$]]10,530,764,911. The vast majority of Angola's exports, 92% in 2004, are petroleum products. [[United States dollar|US$]]785 million worth of diamonds, 7.5% of exports, were sold abroad that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;exports&quot;&gt;[http://www.afrol.com/articles/16248 99.4% of Angola's exports are oil, diamonds] Afrol News&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all of Angola's oil goes to the United States, {{convert|526|koilbbl/d|abbr=on}} in 2006, making it the eighth largest supplier of oil to the United States, and to the [[People's Republic of China]], {{convert|477|koilbbl/d|abbr=on}} in 2006.

===Petroleum===
[[File:Tree map export 2009 Angola.jpeg|thumb|Angolan exports in 2009]]
Angola produces and exports more petroleum than any other nation in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], surpassing [[Nigeria]] in the [[2000s in Angola|2000s]]. In January 2007 Angola became a member of [[OPEC]]. By 2010 production is expected to double the 2006 output level with development of deep-water offshore oil fields. Oil sales generated USD&amp;nbsp;1.71 billion in tax revenue in 2004 and now makes up 80% of the government's budget, a 5% increase from 2003, and 45% of [[GDP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oilview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;budgincrease&quot;&gt;OECD (2006). Page 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chevron Corporation]] produces and receives {{convert|400|koilbbl/d|abbr=on}}, 27% of Angolan oil. [[Total S.A.]], [[Chevron Corporation]], [[ExxonMobil]], [[Eni]], [[Petrobras]], and [[BP]] also operate in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;oilhistory&quot;/&gt;

Block Zero provides the majority of Angola's crude oil production&lt;ref name=&quot;zero&quot;&gt;OECD (2006). Page 132.&lt;/ref&gt; with {{convert|370|koilbbl/d|abbr=on}} produced annually&lt;!-- per day per year ...? --&gt;. The largest fields in Block Zero are Takula (Area A), Numbi (Area A), and Kokongo (Area B). Chevron operates in Block Zero with a 39.2% share. [[SONANGOL]], the state oil company, Total, and Eni own the rest of the block. Chevron also operates Angola's first producing deepwater section, Block 14, with {{convert|57|koilbbl/d|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;opec&quot;/&gt;

The [[United Nations]] has criticized the Angolan government for using torture, rape, summary executions, arbitrary detention, and disappearances, actions which Angolan government has justified on the need to maintain oil output.&lt;ref name=&quot;hroil&quot;&gt;Omeje, Kenneth C. ''High Stakes And Stakeholders: Oil Conflict And Security in Nigeria'', 2006. Page 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Angola is the third-largest trading partner of the United States in Sub-Saharan Africa, largely because of its petroleum exports.&lt;ref name=&quot;thirdlargest&quot;&gt;United States Congress. ''Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations for 1998: Hearings'', 1997. Page 269.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. imports 7% of its oil from Angola, about three times as much as it imported from [[Kuwait]] just prior to the [[Gulf War]] in 1991. The U.S. Government has invested USD $4 billion in Angola's petroleum sector.&lt;ref name=&quot;kuwait&quot;&gt;Vines, Alex. ''Angola Unravels: The Rise and Fall of the Lusaka Peace Process'', 1999.

===Diamonds===
{{Main|Mining in Angola}}
Angola is the third largest producer of diamonds in Africa and has only explored 40% of the diamond-rich territory within the country, but has had difficulty in attracting foreign investment because of corruption, human rights violations, and diamond smuggling.&lt;ref name=&quot;cfr&quot;&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200705071105.html Angola: U.S. Must Strengthen Ties to Protect Strategic Energy and Security Interests] Council on Foreign Relations via AllAfrica&lt;/ref&gt; Production rose by 30% in 2006 and [[Endiama]], the national diamond company of Angola, expects production to increase by 8% in 2007 to 10 million carats annually. The government is trying to attract foreign companies to the [[Provinces of Angola|provinces]] of [[Bié (province)|Bié]], [[Malanje (province)|Malanje]] and [[Uíge Province|Uíge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;diaexploration&quot;&gt;[http://africa.reuters.com/business/news/usnBAN637551.html Angola wants foreign investors for diamond sector], July 26, 2007. Reuters&lt;/ref&gt;

The Angolan government loses $375 million annually from diamond smuggling. In 2003 the government began Operation Brilliant, an anti-smuggling investigation that arrested and deported 250,000 smugglers between 2003 and 2006. Rafael Marques, a journalist and human rights activist, described the diamond industry in his 2006 ''Angola's Deadly Diamonds'' report as plagued by &quot;murders, beatings, arbitrary detentions and other human rights violations.&quot; Marques called on foreign countries to boycott Angola's &quot;[[conflict diamonds]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;marques&quot;&gt;[http://www.afrol.com/articles/15888 Angola to double diamond production in 2006] Afrol News&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iron===
{{Main|Mining in Angola}}
Under Portuguese rule, [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] began mining [[iron]] in 1957, producing 1.2 million tons in 1967 and 6.2 million tons by 1971. In the early 1970s, 70% of Portuguese Angola's iron exports went to [[Western Europe]] and [[Japan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;diaexploration&quot;/&gt; After independence in 1975, the [[Angolan Civil War]] (1975–2002) destroyed most of the territory's mining infrastructure. The redevelopment of the Angolan mining industry started in the late 2000s.

'''Transport in [[Angola]]''' comprises:

== Railways ==
{{main|Rail transport in Angola}}
There are three separate railway lines in Angola:
* [[Luanda Railway]] ([[Caminhos de Ferro de Luanda|CFL]]) (northern)
* [[Benguela Railway]] ([[Caminho de Ferro de Benguela|CFB]]) (central)
* [[Moçâmedes Railway]] ([[Moçâmedes Railway|CFM]]) (southern)

Reconstruction of these three lines began in 2005 and is expected to be completed by the end of the year 2012. The [[Benguela Railway]] already connects to the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].

== Highways ==
[[File:Luanda taxi called Candongueiro after heavy rain, Luanda, 2008.JPG|thumb|Luanda taxi called &quot;Candongueiro&quot; after heavy rainfalls, 2008]]
* ''total:'' 52,429&amp;nbsp;km
:''country comparison to the world:'' 79
* ''paved:'' 5,349&amp;nbsp;km
* ''unpaved:'' 46,080&amp;nbsp;km (2001)

Travel on highways outside of towns and cities in Angola (and in some cases within) is often not best advised for those without four-by-four vehicles.  Whilst a reasonable road infrastructure has existed within Angola, time and the war have taken their toll on the road surfaces, leaving many severely potholed, littered with broken asphalt.  In many areas drivers have established alternate tracks to avoid the worst parts of the surface, although careful attention must be paid to the presence or absence of landmine warning markers by the side of the road.
[[File:Overland road Luanda-Uíge, Angola.jpg|thumb|Overland road Luanda - Uíge recently rehabilitated by Chinese construction company]] 
The Angolan government has contracted the restoration of many of the country's roads, though.  Many companies are coming into the country from China and surrounding nations to help improve road surfaces.  The road between Lubango and Namibe, for example, was completed recently with funding from the European Union, and is comparable to many European main routes.  Progress to complete the road infrastructure is likely to take some decades, but substantial efforts are already being made in the right directions.

In April 2012, the Zambian Development Agency (ZDA) and an Angolan company signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to build a multi-product pipeline from [[Lobito]] to [[Lusaka]], [[Zambia]], to deliver various refined products to Zambia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.times.co.zm/?p=4888|title=Govt, Angola Ink U.S.$2.5 Billion Oil Deal |author=Chila Namaiko |publisher=Times of Zambia|location=Lusaka, Zambia|date=14 April 2012|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.times.co.zm/?p=8706 |title=Angola ready to ‘oil’ Zambia|work=Times of Zambia|location=Lusaka, Zambia|date=9 May 2012|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angola plans to build an oil refinery in Lobito in the coming years.

The '''Angolan Armed Forces''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Forças Armadas Angolanas'') are the [[military]] in [[Angola]] that succeeded the [[Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola]] (FAPLA) following the abortive [[Bicesse Accord]] with the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ([[UNITA]]) in 1991. As part of the peace agreement, troops from both armies were to be [[demilitarized]] and then integrated. Integration was never completed as UNITA went back to war in 1992. Later, consequences for UNITA members in Luanda were harsh with FAPLA veterans persecuting their erstwhile opponents in certain areas and reports of [[vigilantism]].

The FAA is headed by Chief of Staff [[Geraldo Nunda]] since 2010, who reports to the Minister of Defense, currently [[Cândido Pereira Van-Dúnem]]. The [[defense budget]] in 2005 totaled 1.16 billion [[US Dollar]]s.

There are three components, the Army (''Forças Armadas''), Navy (''Marinha de Guerra'') and Air Force ''[[National Air Force of Angola|Força Aérea Nacional Angolana]]''. Reported total manpower in 2013 was about 107,000.&lt;ref&gt;International Institute for Strategic Studies, The Military Balance 2013, 493.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Angolan Army ==
On August 1, 1974 a few months after a military [[coup d'état]] had overthrown the [[Lisbon]] regime and proclaimed its intention of granting independence to Angola, the MPLA announced the formation of FAPLA, which replaced the EPLA. By 1976 FAPLA had been transformed from lightly armed guerrilla units into a national [[army]] capable of sustained field operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[[Library of Congress Country Studies]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990-91, the Army had ten military regions and an estimated 73+ 'brigades', each with a mean strength of 1,000 and comprising inf, tank, APC, artillery, and AA units as required.&lt;ref&gt;IISS Military Balance 1990 or 1991&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Library of Congress]] said in 1990 that '[t]he regular army's 91,500 troops were organized into more than seventy brigades ranging from 750 to 1,200 men each and deployed throughout the ten military regions. Most regions were commanded by lieutenant colonels, with majors as deputy commanders, but some regions were commanded by majors. Each region consisted of one to four provinces, with one or more infantry brigades assigned to it. The brigades were generally dispersed in battalion or smaller unit formations to protect strategic terrain, urban centers, settlements, and critical infrastructure such as bridges and factories. Counterintelligence agents were assigned to all field units to thwart UNITA infiltration. The army's diverse combat capabilities were indicated by its many regular and motorised infantry brigades with organic or attached armor, artillery, and air defense units; two militia infantry brigades; four antiaircraft artillery brigades; ten tank battalions; and six artillery battalions. These forces were concentrated most heavily in places of strategic importance and recurring conflict: the oil-producing [[Cabinda Province]], the area around the capital, and the southern provinces where UNITA and South African forces operated.'

It was reported in 2011 that the army was by far the largest of the services with about 120,000 men and women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globaldefence.net/streitkraefte-der-welt/afrika/346-angola.html Global Defence.net: Angolan Armed Forces] retrieved August 21, 2011 (de)&lt;/ref&gt; The Angolan Army has around 29,000 &quot;ghost workers&quot; who remain enrolled in the ranks of the FAA and therefore receive a salary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioecclesia.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1686:18-anos-das-for-armadas-angolanas&amp;catid=130:sociedade&amp;Itemid=483, Rádio Ecclesia: 18 anos das Forças Armadas Angolanas] retrieved August 22, 2011 (pt)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] reported that the FAA had six divisions, the 1st, 5th, and 6th with two or three infantry brigades, and the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th with five to six infantry brigades. The 4th Division included a tank regiment. A separate tank brigade and special forces brigade were also reported.&lt;ref&gt;IISS 2013, 493.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, the IISS reported the ground forces had 42 armoured/infantry regiments ('detachments/groups - strength varies') and 16 infantry '[[brigade]]s'.&lt;ref&gt;IISS Military Balance 2011, 410.&lt;/ref&gt; These probably comprised [[infantry]], [[tank]]s, [[Armoured personnel carriers|APC]], [[artillery]], and [[Anti-aircraft warfare|AA units]] as required. Major equipment included over 140 [[main battle tank]]s, 600 [[reconnaissance]] vehicles, over 320 [[armored vehicle]]s, [[infantry fighting vehicle]]s, 298 [[howitzers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Defenceweb.co.za&quot; /&gt;

It was reported on May 3, 2007, that the Special Forces Brigade of the Angolan Armed Forces (FAA) located at Cabo Ledo region, northern [[Bengo Province]], would host a 29th anniversary celebration for the entire armed forces. The brigade was reportedly formed on 5 May 1978 and under the command at the time of Colonel Paulo Falcao.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portalangop.co.ao/angola/en_us/noticias/politica/2007/4/18/Army-Special-Forces-Brigade-Celebrate-Years,38c72dcf-fced-44c2-a0c8-cdc9689f0ecd.html Army Special Forces Celebrate Years], May 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Angolan Air Force ==
The [[Angolan Air Force]]'s personnel total about 8,000; its equipment includes six [[Russia]]n-manufactured [[Sukhoi Su-27]] [[fighter aircraft]] and transport planes.&lt;ref&gt;IISS Military Balance 2013, 494&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 one was lost during the civil war with UNITA forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globaldefence.net/streitkraefte-der-welt/afrika/346-angola.html globaldefence.net: Angolan Armed Forces] retrieved August 22, 2011 (de)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the Air Force/Air Defense Forces had 8,000 personnel and 90 combat capable aircraft, including 22 fighters, 59 fighter ground attack aircraft and 16 attack helicopters.

== Angolan Navy (Marinha de Guerra) ==
{{main|Angolan Navy}}

The Navy numbers about 2,500 and operates seven small patrol craft and barges.

The Angolan Navy (MGA) has been neglected and ignored as a military arm mainly due to the guerrilla struggle against the Portuguese and the nature of the civil war. From the early 1990s to the present the Angolan Navy has shrunk from around 4,200 personnel to around 1,000, resulting in the loss of skills and expertise needed to maintain equipment. In order to protect Angola’s 1 600&amp;nbsp;km long coastline, the Angolan Navy is undergoing modernisation but is still lacking in many ways.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Portugal has been providing training through its Technical Military Cooperation (CTM) programme. The Navy is requesting procurement of a frigate, three corvettes, three offshore patrol vessel and additional fast patrol boats.

Most of the craft detailed are from the 1980s or earlier, but the navy acquired new boats from Spain and France in the 1990s. Germany will deliver [[Fast Attack Craft]] for border protection from 2011.

== Foreign deployments ==
The FAPLA's main counterinsurgency effort was directed against UNITA in the southeast, and its conventional capabilities were demonstrated principally in the undeclared [[South African Border War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; The FAPLA first performed its external assistance mission with the dispatch of 1,000 to 1,500 troops to [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] in 1977 to bolster the socialist regime of President Manuel Pinto da Costa. During the next several years, Angolan forces conducted joint exercises with their counterparts and exchanged technical operational visits. The Angolan expeditionary force was reduced to about 500 in early 1985.

The Angolan Armed Forces were controversially involved in training the armed forces of fellow [[Lusophone]] states [[Cape Verde]] and Guinea-Bissau. In the case of the latter, the [[2012 Guinea-Bissau coup d'état]] was cited by the coup leaders as due to Angola's involvement in trying to &quot;reform&quot; the military in connivance with the civilian leadership.

A small number of FAA personnel are stationed in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (Kinshasa) and the [[Republic of the Congo]] (Brazzaville). A presence during the unrest in [[Côte d'Ivoire]], 2010&amp;ndash;2011, were not officially confirmed. However, the ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', citing ''[[Jeune Afrique]]'', said that among President [[Gbagbo]]'s guards were 92 personnel of President Dos Santos's Presidential Guard Unit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/elfenbeinkueste-gbagbos-letzte-trumpfkarte-als-maertyrer-sterben-1628414.html Gbagbos letzte Trumpfkarte: als Märtyrer sterben], 7 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Angola is basically interested in the participation of the FAA operations of the [[African Union]] and has formed special units for this purpose.

{{Politics of Angola}}
The '''foreign relations of Angola''' are based on Angola's strong support of [[U.S. foreign policy]] as the [[Angolan economy]] is dependent on U.S. foreign aid.

From 1975 to 1989, [[Angola]] was aligned with the [[Eastern bloc]], in particular the [[Soviet Union]], [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi#Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (1977–2012)|Libya]], and [[Cuba]]. Since then, it has focused on improving relationships with [[Western world|Western countries]], cultivating links with other Portuguese-speaking countries, and asserting its own national interests in [[Central Africa]] through military and diplomatic intervention. In 1993, it established formal diplomatic relations with the [[United States]]. It has entered the [[Southern African Development Community]] as a vehicle for improving ties with its largely Anglophone neighbors to the south. [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Namibia]] joined Angola in its military intervention in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], where Angolan troops remain in support of the [[Joseph Kabila]] government. It also has intervened in the [[Republic of the Congo]] (Brazzaville) to support the existing government in that country.

Since 1998, Angola has successfully worked with the [[United Nations Security Council]] to impose and carry out sanctions on [[UNITA]]. More recently, it has extended those efforts to controls on [[conflict diamonds]], the primary source of revenue for UNITA. At the same time, Angola has promoted the revival of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries ([[CPLP]]) as a forum for cultural exchange and expanding ties with [[Portugal]] (its former ruler) and [[Brazil]] (which shares many cultural affinities with Angola) in particular.

==Sub-Saharan Africa==

===Cape Verde===
{{main|Angola–Cape Verde relations}}
[[Cape Verde]] signed a friendship accord with [[Angola]] in December 1975, shortly after Angola gained its independence. Cape Verde and [[Guinea-Bissau]] served as stop-over points for [[Cuban troops]] on their way to Angola to fight [[UNITA]] rebels and [[South Africa]]n troops. [[Prime Minister of Cape Verde|Prime Minister]] [[Pedro Pires]] sent [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of the People|FARP]] soldiers to Angola where they served as the personal bodyguards of [[Angolan President]] [[José Eduardo dos Santos]].&lt;ref name=b&gt;{{cite book|last=Lobban|first=Richard|year=1995|title=Cape Verde:Crioulo Colony to Independent Nation|pages=111–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic Republic of the Congo===
Many thousands of Angolans fled the country after the civil war. More than 20,000 people were forced to leave the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] in 2009, an action the DR Congo said was in retaliation for regular expulsion of Congolese diamond miners who were in Angola illegally. Angola sent a delegation to DR Congo's capital [[Kinshasa]] and succeeded in stopping government-forced expulsions which had become a &quot;tit-for-tat&quot;&lt;ref name=Bearak /&gt; immigration dispute. &quot;Congo and Angola have agreed to suspend expulsions from both sides of the border,&quot; said Lambert Mende, DR Congo information minister, in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Congo and Angola 'end expulsions' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8304282.stm|date=October 13, 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-10-13 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;We never challenged the expulsions themselves; we challenged the way they were being conducted — all the beating of people and looting their goods, even sometimes their clothes,&quot; Mende said.&lt;ref name=Bearak&gt;{{cite news|author=Bearak, Barry|title=Congo and Angola Agree to End Expulsions |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/14/world/africa/14angola.html|date=October 13, 2009|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Namibia===
{{main|Angola–Namibia relations}}
Namibia borders Angola to the south. In 1999 Namibia signed a mutual defense pact with its northern neighbor [[Angola]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Situation Report&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This affected the [[Angolan Civil War]] that had been ongoing since Angola's independence in 1975. Namibia's ruling party [[SWAPO]] sought to support the ruling party [[MPLA]] in Angola against the rebel movement [[UNITA]], whose stronghold is in southern Angola, bordering to Namibia. The defence pact allowed Angolan troops to use Namibian territory when attacking [[Jonas Savimbi]]'s UNITA.

===Nigeria===
{{main|Angola–Nigeria relations}}
Angolan-Nigerian relations are primarily based on their roles as oil exporting nations. Both are members of the [[Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries]], the [[African Union]] and other multilateral organizations.

===South Africa===
{{main|Angola–South Africa relations}}
Angola-South Africa relations are quite strong as the ruling parties in both nations, the African National Congress in South Africa and the MPLA in Angola, fought together during the Angolan Civil War and South African Border War. They fought against UNITA rebels, based in Angola, and the apartheid-era government in South Africa who supported them. Nelson Mandela mediated between the MPLA and UNITA factions during the last years of Angola's civil war.

===Zimbabwe===
{{main|Angola–Zimbabwe relations}}
Angola-Zimbabwe relations have remained cordial since the birth of both states, Angola in 1975 and Zimbabwe in 1979, during the [[Cold War]].  While Angola's foreign policy shifted to a pro-U.S. stance based on [[Economy of Angola|substantial economic ties]], under the rule of [[President of Zimbabwe|President]] [[Robert Mugabe]] Zimbabwe's ties with the [[Western world|West]] soured in the late 1990s.

===Guinea-Bissau===
Following a request by the government of [[Guinea-Bissau]], Angola sent there a contingent of about 300 troops meant to help putting an end to the political-military unrest in that country, and to reorganize the local military forces. In fact, these troops were perceived as a kinf of [[Pretorian Guard]] for the ruling party, [[PAIGC]]. In the beginning of April 2012, when a new military [[Coup d'état]] was under preparation, the Angolan regime decided to withdraw its military mission from Guinea-Bissau.

===France===
{{main|Angola–France relations}}
Relations between the two countries have not always been cordial due to the former [[French government]]'s policy of supporting militant separatists in Angola's [[Cabinda province]] and the international [[Angolagate]] scandal embarrassed both governments by exposing corruption and illicit arms deals. Following French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]'s visit in 2008, relations have improved.

===Portugal===
{{main|Angola–Portugal relations}}
Angola-Portugal relations have significantly improved since the [[Angola]]n government abandoned [[communism]] and nominally embraced [[democracy]] in 1991, embracing a pro-[[Angola-United States relations|U.S.]] and to a lesser degree pro-[[Europe]] foreign policy. [[Portugal]] ruled Angola for 400 years,&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{cite book|last=Alker|first=Hayward R.|coauthors=Ted Robert Gurr, Kumar Rupesinghe|year=2001|title=Journeys Through Conflict: Narratives and Lessons|pages=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; colonizing the territory from 1483 until independence in 1975. Angola's war for [[Angolan War for Independence|independence]] did not end in a military victory for either side, but was suspended as a result of a [[Carnation Revolution|coup in Portugal]] that replaced the [[Marcelo Caetano|Caetano regime]].

===Russia===
{{main|Angola–Russia relations}}

==United States==
{{main|Angola–United States relations}}
From the mid-1980s through at least 1992, the United States was the primary source of military and other support for the [[UNITA]] rebel movement, which was led from its creation through 2002 by [[Jonas Savimbi]].  The U.S. refused to recognize Angola diplomatically during this period.

Relations between the [[United States|United States of America]] and the [[Angola|Republic of Angola]] (formerly the [[People's Republic of Angola]]) have warmed since Angola's ideological renunciation of [[Marxism]] before the [[Angolan presidential election, 1992|1992 elections]].

'''Albert Sidney Johnston''' (February 2, 1803 – April 6, 1862) served as a [[General officer|general]] in three different armies: the [[Texian Army|Texian (''i.e.'', Republic of Texas) Army]], the [[United States Army]], and the [[Confederate States Army]]. He saw extensive combat during his military career, fighting actions in the [[Texas War of Independence]], the [[Mexican-American War]], the [[Utah War]], and the [[American Civil War]].

Considered by [[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]] to be the finest (and the second-highest ranking) general officer in the Confederacy before the emergence of [[Robert E. Lee]], he was killed early in the Civil War at the [[Battle of Shiloh]]. Johnston was the highest-ranking officer, Union or Confederate, killed during the entire war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eicher322&quot;&gt;Eicher, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; Davis believed the loss of Johnston &quot;was the turning point of our fate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dupuy, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnston was unrelated to Confederate general [[Joseph E. Johnston]].

==Early life and education==
Johnston was born in [[Washington, Kentucky]], the youngest son of Dr. John and Abigail (Harris) Johnston. His father was a native of [[Salisbury, Connecticut]]. Although Albert Johnston was born in Kentucky, he lived much of his life in [[Texas]], which he considered his home. He was first educated at [[Transylvania University]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]], where he met fellow student [[Jefferson Davis]]. Both were appointed to the [[United States Military Academy]], Davis two years behind Johnston.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth46&quot;&gt;Woodworth, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1826 Johnston graduated eighth of 41 cadets in his class from West Point with a commission as a [[brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Second Lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] in the [[2nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|2nd U.S. Infantry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Eicher322&quot;&gt;Eicher, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnston was assigned to posts in [[New York]] and [[Missouri]] and served in the [[Black Hawk War]] in 1832 as chief of staff to Bvt. Brig. Gen. [[Henry Atkinson (soldier)|Henry Atkinson]]. 

==Marriage and family==
In 1829 he married Henrietta Preston, sister of Kentucky politician and future civil war general [[William Preston (Kentucky)|William Preston]]. They had one son, [[William Preston Johnston]], who became a colonel in the Confederate Army.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csawardept.com/history/Cabinet/WPJohnston/index.html W.P. Johnston biography.]&lt;/ref&gt; The senior Johnston resigned his commission in 1834 to return to Kentucky to care for his dying wife, who succumbed two years later to [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name=Woodworth46/&gt; 

After serving as Secretary of War for the Republic of Texas from 1838 to 1840, Johnston resigned and returned to Kentucky. In 1843, he married Eliza Griffin, his late wife's first cousin. The couple moved to Texas, where they settled on a large [[plantation]] in [[Brazoria County, Texas|Brazoria County]]. Johnston named the property China Grove. Here they raised Johnston's two children from his first marriage, and the first three children born to him and Eliza. (A sixth child was born later when they lived in [[Los Angeles]], California).

==Texas Army==
In April 1834, Johnston took up farming in [[Texas]]. In 1836, he enlisted as a [[Private (rank)|private]] in the Texas Army during the [[Texas War of Independence]] against the Republic of [[Mexico]]. One month later, Johnston was promoted to [[Major (United States)|major]] and the position of [[aide-de-camp]] to General [[Sam Houston]]. He was named [[Adjutant General]] as a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] in the Republic of Texas Army on August 5, 1836. On January 31, 1837, he became senior [[brigadier general]] in command of the Texas Army.

On February 7, 1837, he fought in a [[duel]] with Texas Brig. Gen. [[Felix Huston]], as they challenged each other for the command of the Texas Army; Johnston refused to fire on Huston and lost the position after he was wounded in the pelvis. 

On December 22, 1838, [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]], the second president of the [[Republic of Texas]], appointed Johnston as Secretary of War. He provided for the defense of the Texas border against Mexican invasion, and in 1839 conducted a campaign against [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] in northern Texas. In February 1840, he resigned and returned to Kentucky.

==U.S. Army==
[[File:Albert S Johnston.jpg|thumb|Albert S. Johnston]]
Johnston returned to the Texas Army during the [[Mexican-American War]] under General [[Zachary Taylor]] as a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] of the 1st Texas Rifle Volunteers. The enlistments of his volunteers ran out just before the [[Battle of Monterrey]]. Johnston convinced a few volunteers to stay and fight as he served as the inspector general of volunteers and fought at the battles of Monterrey and [[Battle of Buena Vista|Buena Vista]]. 

He remained on his plantation after the war until he was appointed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Zachary Taylor]] to the U.S. Army as a [[Major (United States)|major]] and was made a paymaster in December 1849. He served in that role for more than five years, making six tours, and traveling more than {{convert|4000|mi|km}} annually on the Indian frontier of Texas. He served on the Texas frontier at [[Fort Mason (Texas)|Fort Mason]] and elsewhere in the West. 

In 1855 President [[Franklin Pierce]] appointed him colonel of the new 2nd U.S. Cavalry (the unit that preceded the modern [[5th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|5th U.S.]]), a new regiment, which he organized. On August 19, 1856, Gen. Persifor Smith, at the request of Kansas Territorial Governor Wilson Shannon, sent Col. Johnston with 1300 men of the 2d Cavalry Dragoons from Fort Riley, troops from Jefferson Barracks, a battalion of the 6th Infantry and Capt. Howe’s artillery company, to protect the territorial capital at Lecompton from an imminent attack by Jim Lane and his abolitionist &quot;Army of the North.&quot; As a key figure in the [[Utah War]], Johnston led U.S. troops who established a non-Mormon government in the formerly [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormon]] territory. He received a [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] promotion to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in 1857 for his service in Utah. He spent 1860 in Kentucky until December 21, when he sailed for California to take command of the Department of the Pacific.

==Civil War==
At the outbreak of the Civil War, Johnston was the commander of the U.S. Army [[Department of the Pacific]] in [[California and the Civil War|California]]. Like many regular army officers from the South, he was opposed to secession. But, he resigned his commission soon after he heard of the [[secession]] of his adopted state Texas. It was accepted by the War Department on May 6, 1861, effective May 3.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 28 he moved to Los Angeles, the home of his wife's brother John Griffin.  Considering staying in California with his wife and five children, Johnston remained there until May. 

Soon, under suspicion by local Union officials, he evaded arrest and joined the [[California in the American Civil War|Los Angeles Mounted Rifles]] as a private, leaving [[Warner's Ranch]] May 27.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, pp. 268, 275-91.&lt;/ref&gt; He participated in their trek across the southwestern deserts to Texas, crossing the [[Colorado River]] into the [[Confederate Territory of Arizona]] on July 4, 1861.

Early in the Civil War, Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]] decided that the Confederacy would attempt to hold as much of its territory as possible, and he distributed its military forces around its borders and coasts.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1861, Davis appointed several generals to defend Confederate lines from the Mississippi River east to the Allegheny Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, pp. 17–33.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The most sensitive, and in many ways the most crucial areas, along the Mississippi River and in western Tennessee along the [[Tennessee River|Tennessee]] and the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] rivers&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, pp. 20–22&lt;/ref&gt; were placed under the command of [[Major General (CSA)|Maj. Gen.]] [[Leonidas Polk]] and [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brig. Gen.]] [[Gideon J. Pillow]]. The latter had initially been in command in Tennessee as that State's top general.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, pp. 30–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Their impolitic occupation of [[Columbus, Kentucky]] on September 3, 1861, two days before Johnston arrived in the Confederacy's capital of [[Richmond in the American Civil War|Richmond, Virginia]], after his cross–country journey, drove Kentucky from its stated neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, pp. 35, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Long, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Kentuckians allied with the Union camp.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, pp. 39, 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Polk and Pillow's action gave Union [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brig. Gen.]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] an excuse to take control of the strategically located town of [[Paducah, Kentucky]] without raising the ire of most Kentuckians and the pro-Union majority in the State legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Long, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confederate command in Western Theater===
On September 10, 1861, Johnston was assigned to command the huge area of the Confederacy west of the Allegheny Mountains, except for coastal areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth51&quot;&gt;Woodworth, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Long, p. 116&quot;&gt;Long, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; He became commander of the Confederacy's western armies in the area often called the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Department]] or Western Military Department.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth51&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Long, p. 116&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnston's appointment as a [[General (CSA)|full general]] by his friend and admirer Jefferson Davis already had been confirmed by the Confederate Senate on August 31, 1861. The appointment had been backdated to rank from May 30, 1861, making him the second highest ranking general in the Confederate States Army. Only Adjutant General and Inspector General [[Samuel Cooper (general)|Samuel Cooper]] ranked ahead of him. Eicher, ''Civil War High Commands.'' p. 807. From General Command Line List. Weigley, p. 110. McPherson, p. 394.&lt;/ref&gt; After his appointment, Johnston immediately headed for his new territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth52&quot;&gt;Woodworth, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; He was permitted to call on governors of Arkansas, Tennessee and Mississippi for new troops, although this authority was largely stifled by politics, especially with respect to Mississippi.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth51&quot;/&gt; On September 13, 1861, Johnston ordered Brig. Gen. [[Felix Zollicoffer]] with 4,000 men to occupy [[Cumberland Gap]] in Kentucky in order to block Union troops from coming into eastern Tennessee. The Kentucky legislature had voted to side with the Union after the occupation of Columbus by Polk.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth52&quot;/&gt; By September 18, Johnston had Brig. Gen. [[Simon Bolivar Buckner]] with another 4,000 men blocking the railroad route to Tennessee at [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth52&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Long, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Johnston had fewer than 40,000 men spread throughout Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas and Missouri.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth53&quot;&gt;Woodworth, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, 10,000 were in Missouri under [[Missouri State Guard]] Maj. Gen. [[Sterling Price]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth53&quot;/&gt; Johnston did not quickly gain many recruits when he first requested them from the governors,  but his more serious problem was lacking sufficient arms and ammunition for the troops he already had.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth53&quot;/&gt; As the Confederate government concentrated efforts on the units in the East, they gave Johnston small numbers of reinforcements and minimal amounts of arms and material.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth55&quot;&gt;Woodworth, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnston maintained his defense by conducting raids and other measures to make it appear he had larger forces than he did, a strategy that worked for several months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth55&quot;/&gt; Johnston's tactics had so annoyed and confused Union Brig. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] that he became somewhat unnerved, overestimated Johnston's forces, and had to be relieved by Brig. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]] on November 9, 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, pp. 55–56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Long, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, p. 394 says Johnston had 70,000 troops to defend his territory between the Appalachians and the Ozarks by the end of 1861.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Mill Springs===
Eastern Tennessee was held for the Confederacy by two unimpressive brigadier generals appointed by Jefferson Davis, Felix Zollicoffer, a brave but untrained and inexperienced officer, and soon to be Maj. Gen. [[George B. Crittenden]], a former U.S. Army officer with apparent alcohol problems.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; While Crittenden was away in Richmond, Zollicoffer moved his forces to the north bank of the upper Cumberland River near Mill Springs (now [[Nancy, Kentucky]]), putting the river to his back and his forces into a trap.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Long, pp. 161–162.&lt;/ref&gt; Zollicoffer decided it was impossible to obey orders to return to the other side of the river because of scarcity of transport and proximity of Union troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth, p. 66&quot;&gt;Woodworth, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; When Union Brig. Gen. [[George H. Thomas]] moved against the Confederates, Crittenden decided to attack one of the two parts of Thomas's command at Logan's Cross Roads near Mill Springs before the Union forces could unite.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth, p. 66&quot;/&gt; On January 19, 1862, the ill-prepared Confederates, after a night march in the rain, attacked the Union force with some initial success.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt; As the battle progressed, Zollicoffer was killed, Crittenden was unable to lead the Confederate force (he may have been intoxicated), and the Confederates were turned back and routed by a Union bayonet charge, suffering 533 casualties from their force of 4,000.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Long, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; The Confederate troops who escaped were assigned to other units as Crittenden faced an investigation of his conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

After this Confederate defeat at the [[Battle of Mill Springs]], Davis sent Johnston a brigade and a few other scattered reinforcements. He also assigned him Gen. [[P.G.T. Beauregard]], who was supposed to attract recruits because of his victories early in the war, and act as a competent subordinate for Johnston .&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, pp. 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt; The brigade was led by Brig. Gen. [[John B. Floyd]], considered incompetent. He took command at [[Fort Donelson]] as the senior general present just before Union Brig. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] attacked the fort.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, pp. 80, 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians believe the assignment of Beauregard to the west stimulated Union commanders to attack the forts before Beauregard could make a difference in the theater.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth7278&quot;&gt;Woodworth, pp. 72, 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Union officers heard that he was bringing 15 regiments with him, but this was an exaggeration of his forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth7278&quot;/&gt;

===Fort Henry, Fort Donelson, Nashville===
Based on the assumption that Kentucky neutrality would act as a shield against a direct invasion from the north, Tennessee initially had sent men to Virginia and concentrated defenses in the Mississippi Valley, circumstances that no longer applied in September 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, ''The Longest Night''. pp. 111–113.&lt;/ref&gt; Even before Johnston arrived in Tennessee, construction of two forts had been started to defend the [[Tennessee River|Tennessee ]] and the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland ]] rivers, which provided avenues into the State from the north.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth56&quot;&gt;Woodworth, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Both forts were located in Tennessee in order to respect Kentucky neutrality, but these were not in ideal locations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth56&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Long142&quot;&gt;Long, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weigley, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, p. 393.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Battle of Fort Henry|Fort Henry]] on the Tennessee River was in an unfavorable low–lying location, commanded by hills on the Kentucky side of the river.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth56&quot;/&gt; [[Fort Donelson]] on the Cumberland River, although in a better location, had a vulnerable land side and did not have enough heavy artillery to defend against gunboats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth56&quot;/&gt; 

Maj. Gen. Polk ignored the problems of the forts when he took command. After Johnston took command, Polk at first refused to comply with Johnston's order to send an engineer, Lt. Joseph K. Dixon, to inspect the forts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth57&quot;&gt;Woodworth, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; After Johnston asserted his authority, Polk had to allow Dixon to proceed. Dixon recommended that the forts be maintained and strengthened, although they were not in ideal locations, because much work had been done on them and the Confederates might not have time to build new ones. Johnston accepted his recommendations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth57&quot;/&gt; Johnston wanted Major, later [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lt. Gen.]], [[Alexander P. Stewart]] to command the forts but President Davis appointed Brig. Gen. [[Lloyd Tilghman]] as commander.&lt;ref name=&quot;Long142&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth57&quot;/&gt; 

To prevent Polk from dissipating his forces by allowing some men to join a partisan group, Johnston ordered him to send Brig. Gen. Gideon Pillow and 5,000 men to Fort Donelson.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth58&quot;&gt;Woodworth, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Pillow took up a position at nearby [[Clarksville, Tennessee]] and did not move into the fort until February 7, 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Long, pp. 167–168.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, ''The Longest Night'', p. 171 says the garrison at Fort Donelson numbered 1,956 men before the Fort Henry garrison and the men under Floyd and Pillow joined them in early February 1862.&lt;/ref&gt; Alerted by a Union reconnaissance on January 14, 1862, Johnston ordered Tilghman to fortify the high ground opposite Fort Henry, which Polk had failed to do despite Johnston's orders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth71&quot;&gt;Woodworth, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Tilghman failed to act decisively on these orders, which in any event were too late to be adequately carried out.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth71&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, p. 396.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Confederate battery and the beginning of some fortifications were sited across the river at [[Fort Heiman]] but these were of little value when the Union flotilla appeared.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gen. Beauregard arrived at Johnston's headquarters at Bowling Green on February 4, 1862 and was given overall command of Polk's force at the western end of Johnston's line at Columbus, Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;After some preliminary work with Johnston, Beauregard assumed command of this force, which he named the Army of the Mississippi, on March 5, 1862 while at Jackson, Tennessee. Like the other Confederate commander, he had to withdraw to the south after the fall of the forts or be surrounded by the advancing Union forces. Long, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 6, 1862, [[Union Navy]] gunboats quickly reduced the defenses of ill-sited Fort Henry, inflicting 21 casualties on the small remaining Confederate force.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth7879&quot;&gt;Woodworth, pp. 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Long167&quot;&gt;Long, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Brig. Gen. Lloyd Tilghman surrendered the 94 remaining officers and men of his approximately 3,000-man force which had not been sent to Fort Donelson before U.S. Grant's force could even take up their positions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth7879&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Long, pp. 166–167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weigley, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnston knew he could be trapped at Bowling Green if Fort Donelson fell, so he moved his force to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], the capital of Tennessee and an increasingly important Confederate industrial center, beginning on February 11, 1862.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth79&quot;&gt;Woodworth, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loing, pp. 169–170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnston also reinforced Fort Donelson with 12,000 more men, including those under Floyd and Pillow, a curious decision in view of his thought that the Union gunboats alone might be able to take the fort.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth79&quot;/&gt; He did order the commanders of the fort to evacuate the troops if the fort could not be held.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth80&quot;&gt;Woodworth, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The senior generals sent to the fort to command the enlarged garrison, Gideon J. Pillow and John B. Floyd, squandered their chance to avoid having to surrender most of the garrison&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, pp. 400–401.&lt;/ref&gt; and on February 16, 1862, Brig. Gen. Simon Buckner, having been abandoned by Floyd&lt;ref&gt;Floyd was able to ferry his four Virginia regiments out of the fort with him but left his Mississippi regiment behind to surrender with the rest of the garrison. Pillow escaped only with his chief of staff. Woodworth, p. 83. Long, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; and  Pillow, surrendered Fort Donelson.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, pp. 82–84.&lt;/ref&gt; Colonel [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] escaped with his cavalry force of about 700 men before the surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, pp. 401–402.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This included about 200 men not in Forrest's immediate command. Weigley, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; The Confederates suffered about 1,500 casualties with an estimated 12,000 to 14,000 taken prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;Long, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weigley111&quot;&gt;Weigley, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Union casualties were 500 killed, 2,108 wounded, 224 missing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weigley111&quot;/&gt;

Johnston, who had little choice in allowing Floyd and Pillow to take charge at Fort Donelson on the basis of seniority after he ordered them to add their forces to the garrison, took the blame and suffered calls for his removal because a full explanation to the press and public would have exposed the weakness of the Confederate position.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, pp. 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt; His passive defensive performance while positioning himself in a forward position at Bowling Green, spreading his forces too thinly, not concentrating his forces in the face of Union advances, and appointing or relying upon inadequate or incompetent subordinates subjected him to criticism at the time and by later historians.&lt;ref&gt;Weigley, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, pp. 405–406.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis defended Johnston, saying: &quot;If Sidney Johnston is not a general, we had better give up the war, for we have no general.&quot; McPherson, p. 495.&lt;/ref&gt; The fall of the forts exposed Nashville to imminent attack, and it fell without resistance to Union forces under Brig. Gen. Buell on February 25, 1862, two days after Johnston had to pull his forces out in order to avoid having them captured as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth86&quot;&gt;Woodworth, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Long, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concentration at Corinth===
Johnston had various remaining military units scattered throughout his territory and retreating to the south to avoid being cut off.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, pp. 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnston himself retreated with the force under his personal command, the [[Army of Central Kentucky]], from the vicinity of Nashville.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth86&quot;/&gt; With Beauregard's help,&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnston decided to concentrate forces with those formerly under Polk and now already under Beauregard's command at the strategically located railroad crossroads of [[Corinth, Mississippi]], which he reached by a circuitous route.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, pp. 86–88.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnston kept the Union forces, now under the overall command of the ponderous Maj. Gen. [[Henry Halleck]], confused and hesitant to move, allowing Johnston to reach his objective undetected.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; This delay allowed Jefferson Davis finally to send reinforcements from the garrisons of coastal cities and another highly rated but prickly general, [[Braxton Bragg]], to help organize the western forces.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, pp. 90, 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Bragg at least calmed the nerves of Beauregard and Polk who had become agitated by their apparent dire situation in the face of numerically superior forces before the arrival of Johnston on March 24, 1862.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth95&quot;&gt;Woodworth, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Long, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnston's army of 17,000 men gave the Confederates a combined force of about 40,000 to 44,669 men at Corinth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth95&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McPherson,p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, ''The Longest Night'', p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 29, 1862, Johnston officially took command of this combined force, which continued to use the Army of the Mississippi name under which it had been organized by Beauregard on March 5.&lt;ref&gt;Long, 190.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, ''Civil War High Commands'' p. 887 and Eicher, ''The Longest Night'' p. 219 are nearly alone in referring to this army as the Army of Mississippi. Muir, p. 85, in discussing the first &quot;Army of Mississippi&quot; includes this army as one of three in the article with that title but states: &quot;Historians have pointed out that the Army of Mississippi is frequently mentioned in the Official Records as the Army of the Mississippi.&quot; Contemporaries, including Johnston and Beauregard, and modern historians call this Confederate army the Army of the Mississippi.

Williams, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Johnston now planned to defeat the Union forces piecemeal before the various Union units in Kentucky and Tennessee under Grant with 40,000 men at nearby [[Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee]], and the now Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell on his way from Nashville with 35,000 men, could unite against him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodworth95&quot;/&gt; Johnston started his army in motion on April 3, 1862, intent on surprising Grant's force as soon as the next day, but they moved slowly due to their inexperience, bad roads and lack of adequate staff planning.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Long, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; Johnston's army was finally in position within a mile or two of Grant's force, and undetected, by the evening of April 5, 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Long, pp. 193–194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weigley, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, pp. 406–407.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnston did not achieve total surprise as some Union pickets were alerted to the Confederate presence and provided warning to some Union units before the attack began.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Shiloh and death===
[[File:Johnston Shiloh Monument.jpg|thumb|right|Monument to Johnston at [[Shiloh National Military Park]].]]
Johnston launched a massive surprise attack with his concentrated forces against Grant at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] on April 6, 1862. As the Confederate forces overran the Union camps, Johnston seemed to be everywhere, personally leading and rallying troops up and down the line on his horse. At about 2:30 p.m., while leading one of those charges against a Union camp near the &quot;Peach Orchard&quot;, he was wounded, taking a bullet behind his right knee. He apparently did not think the wound was serious at the time, and so he sent his personal physician to attend to some wounded captured Union soldiers instead. It is possible that Johnston's duel in 1837 had caused nerve damage or numbness to his right leg and that he did not feel the wound to his leg as a result. The bullet had in fact clipped a part of his [[popliteal artery]] and his boot was filling up with blood. Within a few minutes, Johnston was observed by his staff to be nearly fainting off his horse. Among his staff was [[Isham G. Harris]], the [[Governor of Tennessee]], who had ceased to make any real effort to function as governor after learning that [[Abraham Lincoln]] had appointed [[Andrew Johnson]] as military governor of Tennessee. Seeing Johnston slumping in his saddle and his face turning deathly pale, Harris asked: &quot;General, are you wounded?&quot; Johnston glanced down at his leg wound, then faced Harris and replied with his last words: &quot;Yes, and I fear seriously.&quot; Harris and other staff officers removed Johnston from his horse and carried him to a small ravine near the &quot;Hornets Nest&quot; and desperately tried to aid the general by trying to make a [[tourniquet]] for his leg wound, but little could be done by this point since he had already lost so much blood. He soon lost consciousness and bled to death a few minutes later. Harris and the other officers wrapped General Johnston's body in a blanket so as not to damage the troops' morale with the sight of the dead general. Johnston and his wounded horse, named Fire Eater, were taken to his field headquarters on the Corinth road, where his body remained in his tent until the Confederate Army withdrew to Corinth the next day, April 7, 1862. From there, his body was taken to the home of Colonel William Inge, which had been his headquarters in Corinth. It was covered in the Confederate flag and lay in state for several hours.&lt;ref&gt;Sword, pp. 270-73, 443-46; Cunningham, pp. 273-76; Smith, pp. 26-34. Sword offers evidence that Johnston lived as long as an hour after receiving his fatal wound.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is probable that a Confederate soldier fired the fatal round. No Union soldiers were observed to have ever gotten behind Johnston during the fatal charge, while it is known that many Confederates were firing at the Union lines while Johnston charged well in advance of his soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Sword, p. 444.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnston was the highest-ranking casualty of the war on either side,&lt;ref&gt;Johnston is the only four-star (full) American general ever killed in battle. Muir, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; and his death was a strong blow to the morale of the Confederacy. Jefferson Davis considered him the best general in the country; this was two months before the emergence of [[Robert E. Lee]] as the pre-eminent general of the Confederacy.

==Legacy and honors==
[[File:Albert Sidney Johnston Tomb.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Johnston's tomb in the [[Texas State Cemetery]] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]]]]
[[File:Johnston_tomb.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|Sculpted by [[Elisabet Ney]]]]

Johnston was survived by his wife Eliza and six children. His wife and five younger children, including one born after he went to war, chose to live out their days at home in Los Angeles with Eliza's brother, Dr. [[John Strother Griffin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fjoba]&lt;/ref&gt;  Johnston's eldest son, Albert Sidney Jr. (born in Texas), had already followed him into the Confederate States Army.  In 1863, after taking home leave in Los Angeles, Albert Jr. was on his way out of [[San Pedro, California|San Pedro]] harbor on a ferry.  While a steamer was taking on passengers from the ferry, a wave swamped the smaller boat, causing its boilers to explode. Johnston, Jr. was killed in the accident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15799coll68/id/1003/rec/36]&lt;/ref&gt;

Killed in action, General Johnston received the highest praise ever given by the Confederate government; fulsome accounts were published, on December 20, 1862 and thereafter, in the Los Angeles ''Star'' of his family's hometown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15799coll68/id/1019/rec/1]&lt;/ref&gt;  Johnston Street, Hancock Street, and Griffin Avenue, each in northeast Los Angeles, are named after the general and his family, who lived in the neighborhood.

Johnston was initially buried in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]. In 1866, a joint resolution of the [[Texas Legislature]] was passed to have his body moved and reinterred at the [[Texas State Cemetery]] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. The re-interment occurred in 1867. Forty years later, the state appointed [[Elisabet Ney]] to design a monument and sculpture of him to be erected at the gravesite.

The [[Texas Historical Commission]] has erected a historical marker near the entrance of what was once Johnston's [[plantation]]. An adjacent marker was erected by the San Jacinto Chapter of the [[Daughters of The Republic of Texas]] and the Lee, Roberts, and Davis Chapter of the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy|United Daughters of the Confederate States of America]].

The [[University of Texas at Austin]] has recognized Johnston with a statue on the South Mall.

However, advancements in [[robotics|robot technology]] have allowed the design of functional and realistic humanoid robots.&lt;ref&gt;Ishiguro, Hiroshi. [http://www.androidscience.com/proceedings2005/IshiguroCogSci2005AS.pdf &quot;Android science.&quot;], ''[[Cognitive Science Society]]'', Osaka, 2005. Retrieved on 3 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word was coined from the [[Greek language|Greek]] root ἀνδρ- 'man' and the suffix ''[[Wiktionary:-oid|-oid]]'' 'having the form or likeness of'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], Draft Revision, December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' traces the earliest use (as &quot;Androides&quot;) to [[Ephraim Chambers]]' ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]],'' in reference to an [[automaton]] that St. [[Albertus Magnus]] allegedly created.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stableford2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''OED'' at &quot;android&quot; citing Ephraim Chambers, ''Cyclopædia; or, a universal dictionary of arts and sciences.'' 1728.&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;android&quot; appears in US patents as early as 1863 in reference to miniature human-like toy automatons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=QhIAAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=patent:40891%7C|title=U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Patent# 40891, ''Toy Automation''|publisher=[[Google Patents]]| accessdate = 7 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''android'' was used in a more modern sense by the French author [[Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam]] in his work ''[[The Future Eve|Tomorrow's Eve]]'' (1886).&lt;ref name=&quot;Stableford2006&quot;/&gt; This story features an artificial humanlike robot named Hadaly. As said by the officer in the story, &quot;In this age of Realien advancement, who knows what goes on in the mind of those responsible for these mechanical dolls.&quot; The term made an impact into English [[pulp science fiction]] starting from [[Jack Williamson]]'s ''[[The Cometeers]]'' (1936) and the distinction between mechanical robots and fleshy androids was popularized by [[Edmond Hamilton]]'s [[Captain Future]] (1940–1944).&lt;ref name=&quot;Stableford2006&quot;/&gt;

Although [[Karel Čapek|Karel Čapek's]] robots in ''[[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)]]'' (1921)&amp;nbsp;– the play that introduced the word ''[[robot]]'' to the world&amp;nbsp;– were organic artificial humans, the word &quot;robot&quot; has come to primarily refer to mechanical humans, animals, and other beings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stableford2006&quot;/&gt; The term &quot;android&quot; can mean either one of these,&lt;ref name=&quot;Stableford2006&quot;/&gt; while a [[cyborg]] (&quot;cybernetic organism&quot; or &quot;bionic man&quot;) would be a creature that is a combination of organic and mechanical parts.

The term &quot;[[Droid (robot)|droid]]&quot;, coined by [[George Lucas]] for the original ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' film and now used widely within science fiction, originated as an abridgment of &quot;android&quot;, but has been used by Lucas and others to mean any robot, including distinctly non-human form machines like [[R2-D2]]. The word &quot;android&quot; was used in ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' episode ''What Are Little Girls Made Of?'' The abbreviation &quot;andy&quot;, coined as a [[pejorative]] by writer [[Philip K. Dick]] in his novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'', has seen some further usage, such as within the TV series ''[[Total Recall 2070]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;TR2070&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Rough Whimper of Insanity|url=http://www.fancast.com/tv/Total-Recall-2070/10604/full-episodes|series=Total Recall 2070|serieslink=Total Recall 2070|credits=Levin, Drew S. (exec. prod.)|network=[[Channel Zero Inc.|Channel Zero]]|station=[[CHCH-TV]]|city=[[Toronto]]|airdate=23 February 1999|season=1|number=7|minutes=2:10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors have used the term ''android'' in more diverse ways than ''[[robot]]'' or ''[[cyborg]]''. In some fictional works, the difference between a robot and android is only their appearance, with androids being made to look like humans on the outside but with robot-like internal mechanics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stableford2006&quot;/&gt; In other stories, authors have used the word &quot;android&quot; to mean a wholly organic, yet artificial, creation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stableford2006&quot;/&gt; Other fictional depictions of androids fall somewhere in between.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stableford2006&quot;/&gt;

Eric G. Wilson, who defines androids as a &quot;synthetic human being&quot;, distinguishes between three types of androids, based on their body's composition:
* the mummy type - where androids are made of &quot;dead things&quot; or &quot;stiff, inanimate, natural material&quot;, such as mummies, puppets, dolls and statues
* the golem type - androids made from flexible, possibly organic material, including golems and homunculi
* the automaton type - androids which are a mix of dead and living parts, including automatons and robots&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson2006&quot;/&gt;

Although human morphology is not necessarily the ideal form for working robots, the fascination in developing robots that can mimic it can be found historically in the assimilation of two concepts: ''[[Simulacrum|simulacra]]'' (devices that exhibit likeness) and ''[[Automata theory|automata]]'' (devices that have independence).

==Projects==

===Japan===
[[File:Actroid-DER 01.jpg|thumb|DER 01, a Japanese [[actroid]]]]
The Intelligent Robotics Lab, directed by [[Hiroshi Ishiguro]] at [[Osaka University]], and Kokoro Co., Ltd. have demonstrated the [[Actroid]] at [[Expo 2005]] in [[Aichi Prefecture]], Japan. In 2006, Kokoro Co. developed a new ''DER 2'' android. The height of the human body part of DER2 is 165&amp;nbsp;cm. There are 47 mobile points. DER2 can not only change its expression but also move its hands and feet and twist its body. The &quot;air servosystem&quot; which Kokoro Co. developed originally is used for the actuator. As a result of having an actuator controlled precisely with air pressure via a servosystem, the movement is very fluid and there is very little noise. DER2 realized a slimmer body than that of the former version by using a smaller cylinder. Outwardly DER2 has a more beautiful proportion. Compared to the previous model, DER2 has thinner arms and a wider repertoire of expressions. Once programmed, it is able to choreograph its motions and gestures with its voice.

The Intelligent Mechatronics Lab, directed by Hiroshi Kobayashi at the [[Tokyo University of Science]], has developed an android head called ''Saya'', which was exhibited at Robodex 2002 in [[Yokohama]], Japan. There are several other initiatives around the world involving humanoid research and development at this time, which will hopefully introduce a broader spectrum of realized technology in the near future. Now Saya is ''working'' at the Science University of Tokyo as a guide.

The [[Waseda University]] (Japan) and [[NTT docomo|NTT Docomo's]] manufacturers have succeeded in creating a shape-shifting robot ''WD-2''. It is capable of changing its face. At first, the creators decided the positions of the necessary points to express the outline, eyes, nose, and so on of a certain person. The robot expresses its face by moving all points to the decided positions, they say. The first version of the robot was first developed back in 2003. After that, a year later, they made a couple of major improvements to the design. The robot features an elastic mask made from the average head dummy. It uses a driving system with a 3DOF unit. The WD-2 robot can change its facial features by activating specific facial points on a mask, with each point possessing three [[degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]]. This one has 17 facial points, for a total of 56 degrees of freedom. As for the materials they used, the WD-2's mask is fabricated with a highly elastic material called Septom, with bits of steel wool mixed in for added strength. Other technical features reveal a shaft driven behind the mask at the desired facial point, driven by a DC motor with a simple pulley and a slide screw. Apparently, the researchers can also modify the shape of the mask based on actual human faces. To &quot;copy&quot; a face, they need only a 3D scanner to determine the locations of an individual's 17 facial points. After that, they are then driven into position using a laptop and 56 motor control boards. In addition, the researchers also mention that the shifting robot can even display an individual's hair style and skin color if a photo of their face is projected onto the 3D Mask.

===Korea===
[[File:Ever-2.jpg|thumb|200px|[[EveR-2]], the first android that has the ability to [[singing|sing]]]]

[[KITECH]] researched and developed [[EveR-1]], an android interpersonal communications model capable of emulating human emotional expression via facial &quot;musculature&quot; and capable of rudimentary conversation, having a vocabulary of around 400 words. She is {{nowrap|160 cm}} tall and weighs {{nowrap|50 kg}}, matching the average figure of a Korean women in her twenties. EveR-1's name derives from the [[Eve|Biblical Eve]], plus the letter ''r'' for ''robot''. EveR-1's advanced computing processing power enables [[speech recognition]] and vocal synthesis, at the same time processing [[lip synchronization]] and visual recognition by 90-degree micro-[[charge-coupled device|CCD]] cameras with [[facial recognition system|face recognition technology]]. An independent microchip inside her artificial brain handles gesture expression, body coordination, and emotion expression. Her whole body is made of highly advanced synthetic jelly silicon and with 60 artificial joints in her face, neck, and lower body; she is able to demonstrate realistic facial expressions and sing while simultaneously dancing. In South Korea, the [[Ministry of Information and Communication (South Korea)|Ministry of Information and Communication]]  has an ambitious plan to put a robot in every household by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/09/060906-robots.html |title=A Robot in Every Home by 2020, South Korea Says |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=28 October 2010 |accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several robot cities have been planned for the country: the first will be built in 2016 at a cost of 500 billion won, of which 50 billion is direct government investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2007/08/27/south-korea-set-to-build-robot-land/ |title=South Korea set to build &quot;Robot Land&quot; |publisher=Engadget |accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new robot city will feature research and development centers for manufacturers and part suppliers, as well as exhibition halls and a stadium for robot competitions. The country's new Robotics Ethics Charter will establish ground rules and laws for human interaction with robots in the future, setting standards for robotics users and manufacturers, as well as guidelines on ethical standards to be programmed into robots to prevent human abuse of robots and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/03/070316-robot-ethics.html |title=Robot Code of Ethics to Prevent Android Abuse, Protect Humans |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=28 October 2010 |accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walt Disney and a staff of [[Imagineers]] created [[Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln]] that debuted at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]].&lt;ref name=&quot;illinois_pavillion&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nywf64.com/illinois02.shtml|title=Pavilions &amp;amp; Attractions - Illinois - Page Two|accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Hanson (robotics designer)|Hanson Robotics, Inc.]], of Texas and [[KAIST]] produced an android portrait of [[Albert Einstein]], using Hanson's facial android technology mounted on KAIST's life-size walking bipedal robot body. This Einstein android, also called &quot;[[Albert Hubo]]&quot;, thus represents the first full-body walking android in history (see video at &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hansonrobotics.wordpress.com Einstein Video&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;). Hanson Robotics, the FedEx Institute of Technology,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fedex.memphis.edu FedEx Institute of Technology :: FedEx Institute of Technology :: University of Memphis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the University of Texas at Arlington also developed the android portrait of sci-fi author [[Philip K. Dick]] (creator of ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'', the basis for the film ''[[Blade Runner]]''), with full conversational capabilities that incorporated thousands of pages of the author's works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pkdandroid.org/about.htm About the Philip K Dick Android]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the PKD android won a first place [[artificial intelligence]] award from [[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence|AAAI]].

===United Kingdom===
In 2001, [[Steve Grand]] OBE, creator of the computer game ''Creatures'', created an android, or anthropoid, he named it Lucy. The intention was that she would have to learn everything, including how to use her mechanical [[vocal chord]]s to speak. Her systems were made to be similar to a human's.

&lt;!-- Please add descriptions of individual androids to that list, not here, so as to avoid duplication. Thanks! --&gt;

Androids are a staple of [[science fiction]]. [[Isaac Asimov]] pioneered the fictionalization of the science of [[robotics]] and [[artificial intelligence]], notably in his 1950s series ''[[I, Robot]]'' and ''[[Foundation and Empire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jonathan Barra|first=Roger Caille et al.|title=The Android Generation|url=http://midnighttracks.net/2012/2012_rdr_8.html|publisher=West Coast Midnight Run/Citadel Consulting Group LLC|accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One thing common to most fictional androids is that the real-life technological challenges associated with creating thoroughly human-like robots&amp;nbsp;– such as the creation of [[artificial general intelligence|strong artificial intelligence]]&amp;nbsp;– are assumed to have been solved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Riper 11&quot;&gt;Van Riper, op.cit., p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Fictional androids are often depicted as mentally and physically equal or superior to humans&amp;nbsp;– moving, thinking and speaking as fluidly as them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stableford2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Riper 11&quot;/&gt;

The tension between the nonhuman substance and the human appearance&amp;nbsp;– or even human ambitions&amp;nbsp;– of androids is the dramatic impetus behind most of their fictional depictions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Riper 11&quot;/&gt; Some android heroes seek, like [[Pinocchio]], to become human, as in the films ''[[Bicentennial Man (film)|Bicentennial Man]]'', ''[[Hollywood (Kannada film)|Hollywood]]'', ''[[Enthiran]]'' and ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Riper 11&quot; /&gt; or [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] in ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. Others, as in the film ''[[Westworld]]'', rebel against abuse by careless humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Riper 11&quot;/&gt; Android hunter [[Rick Deckard|Deckard]] in ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' and its film adaptation ''[[Blade Runner]]'' discovers that his targets are, in some ways, more human than he is.&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Riper 11&quot;/&gt; Android stories, therefore, are not essentially stories &quot;about&quot; androids; they are stories about the [[human condition]] and what it means to be human.&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Riper 11&quot;/&gt;

One aspect of writing about the meaning of humanity is to use discrimination against androids as a mechanism for exploring [[racism]] in society, as in ''Blade Runner''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dinello76&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dinello|first=Daniel|title=Technophobia!: Science Fiction Visions of Posthuman Technology|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BA_1sOD40K4C&amp;pg=PA76|accessdate=22 November 2011|year=2005|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the clearest example of this is [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner's]] 1968 novel ''[[Into the Slave Nebula]]'', where the blue-skinned android slaves are explicitly shown to be fully human.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|last= D'Ammassa|first=Don|year=2005|publisher=Facts on File|page = 58|isbn = 978-0-8160-5924-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the androids [[Bishop (Aliens)|Bishop]] and Annalee Call in the films ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' and ''[[Alien Resurrection]]'' are used as vehicles for exploring how humans deal with the presence of an &quot;[[Other]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1353/cj.2005.0011|last=Nishime|first=LeiLani|title=The Mulatto Cyborg: Imagining a Multiracial Future|journal = Cinema Journal|volume=44|issue=2|pages=34–49|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|date=Winter 2005|accessdate=10 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female androids, or &quot;[[gynoid]]s&quot;, are often seen in science fiction, and can be viewed as a continuation of the long tradition of men attempting to create the stereotypical &quot;perfect woman&quot;.&lt;ref name=melzer202&gt;{{Cite book|title=Alien Constructions: Science Fiction and Feminist Thought|last=Melzer|first=Patricia|year=2006|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|page=202|isbn= 978-0-292-71307-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[Greek mythology|Greek myth]] of ''[[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]]'' and [[Maschinenmensch|the female robot Maria]] in [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]''. Some gynoids, like Pris in [[Blade Runner]], are designed as sex-objects, with the intent of &quot;pleasing men's violent sexual desires,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Melzer, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; or as submissive, servile companions, such as in ''[[The Stepford Wives]]''. Fiction about gynoids has therefore been described as reinforcing &quot;essentialist ideas of femininity&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = SciFi in the mind's eye: reading science through science fiction|last=Grebowicz|first=Margret|authorlink= |coauthors= L.
